<h4 id="social-distancing">Social Distancing</h4>
<p>The idea behind social distancing is to minimize risk of getting infected. The
less people you talk to, the less often you interact with other humans, the
less risk to spread the virus.</p>
<p>The main point of it is not that you don't get infected (although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLSG-7K3Tc">you really don't want to get this</a>), but that the infection
over the country slows down. Roughly 5% of people who get infected need
intensive care at hospital. We only have a limited amount of beds in hospitals
for intensive care. If we run out of beds, people die. This is what "flatten
the curve" is about.</p>
<h5 id="flatten-the-curve">Flatten The Curve</h5>
<p>The following summarizes what Harald Lesch discuessed (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx11Y4xjDwA">video</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>5% of people who get COVID-19 need intensive care at hospital (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130">source</a>)</li>
<li>A hospitalized case stays there for 11 days in average (<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/815408287/how-the-novel-coronavirus-and-the-flu-are-alike-and-different">source</a>)</li>
<li>Germany has 28,000 intensive care beds in hospitals (<a href="https://www.mdr.de/wissen/kliniken-krankenhaeuser-deutschland-kapazitaet-corona-100.html">source</a>). However, there are still other diseases. So we can't use all of them just for COVID-19 cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means once we have more than 28000/0.05 = 560k new infections per day, we
have a problem.</p>
<p>The infections seem to follow an exponential growth pattern, but that doesn't
make much sense within limited populations. Assuming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_growth">logistic growth
pattern</a> makes more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>It starts like exponential growth</li>
<li>At some point it flattens out to linear growth</li>
<li>At the end, getting the last few uninfected people, it decays exponentially</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking this growth model (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function">generalized logistic function</a>) and the
thoughts from before. I also assume that once 20 million people (1/4th of
Germany) was infected, the virus will basically stop due to heard immunity. I
don't know if this is a reasonable assumption. The higher this number needs to
be, the more depressing the picture looks:</p>
<figure class="aligncenter img-thumbnail">
<a href="../images/2020/03/flatten-the-curve.png"><img alt="The number of new infections by day. Note that the total number of infections in both cases is the same, but the number of people ofer the capacity of hospitals is lower. This means less people die because of missing medical equipment" src="../images/2020/03/flatten-the-curve.png" style="width: 512px;"/></a>
<figcaption class="text-center">The number of new infections by day. Note that the total number of infections in both cases is the same, but the flatter curve is within the carring capacity of the hospitals. This means no people die because of missing medical equipment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/MartinThoma/algorithms/tree/master/Python/covid-19">code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>However, looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_in_mainland_China#Statistics">the statistics for China</a>, one
can see that the number of sick people decreases after roughly 33 days. So if
other countries have similar strict quarantines, I would expect a similar
behaviour. This would mean for Germany that the most severe time is already
behind us. I guess the truth is somewhere in between. I I would need to to
guess, I would say that the situation will become more severe until maybe 20th
of April and then becomes better.</p>
<p>I was pretty confused when I was trying to calculate those numbers. It seemed as
every scenario which stayed under the capacity of the healthcare system would
take massive measures to reach (isolation) and then also make the pandemic take
at least a year, rather two years. This was confirmed in <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. Obviously, it
is not possible to keep those measures up that long.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting part: <strong>Due to economic reasons, we cannot keep
half-isolation measures that we get herd immunity. But we could keep isolation
for a couple of weeks even more extreme so that we can start contract tracing
again.</strong> Mai Thi also gives an example how long it would take with "Wuhan-Style" lockdown
to contain the disease again: 56 days (see <a href="https://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html">Epidemic Calculator</a>).</p>
<h4 id="support-others">Support Others</h4>
<p>Eldery people are at most risk. They should isolate themselves as much as
possible. Maybe you can buy them food? Maybe you can call your (grand) parents
or teach them how to use video chat software like Skype, so that they don't
feel alone.</p>
<p>Medical staff and eldery care staff also needs your help basically the same way
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmSPOSGpAYs">video, 49s</a>): Help them to buy
groceries and give them emotional support. They have a pretty stressful time
right now, they are not super well paid, they are in contact with all the sick
people. Remember: You might need them as well.</p>
<h3 id="in-future">...in future?</h3>
<p>Personally, you can do a bit of prepping so that you don't panic when there is
an pandemic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have enough food for 14 days at home, for example pasta, rice, wheat, and oil</li>
<li>Have toiletries for at least 14 days at home</li>
<li>Be well-connected with your family and friends</li>
<li>Have a bike / car, so that you can go alone to the supermarket.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste">Zero Waste</a>: If you have re-usable
  stuff, you might need to buy less. For example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Silicone-Baking-Mat-Sheet/dp/B0725GYNG6">Silicone baking mats</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handkerchiefs-Cotton-White-Hankie-Pieces/dp/B01930CBF4">cotton handkerchiefs</a> can help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies can move to a remote-first strategy. <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/working-remotely/">Working remotely</a> has a couple of advantages. It can be supported by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure people have a laptop which they can take home<ul>
<li>Make sure people have a video conference software installed (e.g. Skype)</li>
<li>Make sure people have access to everything from outside the company network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Company-wide chat (e.g. Slack / <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools and the boards of education of countries can finally put the
educational material online, for free. It's about time.</p>
<p>Government agencies can do the same what companies can do, but additionally
make sure that the people don't need to come in person.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-government">E-government</a> rules.</p>
<p>Countries can make sure they have clear plans what to do. Especially hospitals
need to be equipped (material and people).</p>
<h2 id="course-of-disease_1">Course of disease</h2>
<p>A lot of the following is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Everything starts with the <strong>infection</strong>. The virus is spread via respiratory
droplets produced when people cough or sneeze<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The virus stays alive outside
of the human body on different materials for an astonishing long time<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>After the infection, the following symptoms may appear<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. The time between
infection and symptoms is called <em>incubation period</em> and is typically five to
six days for COVID-19 but may range from two to 14 days<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>
cases. That means people have the infection and are infecting others, but don't
show any symptoms. There might be 50% of infected people being asymptomatic<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.

<p>Mild symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual may resolve over just a few
days. Similar to influenza, for an individual with other ongoing health issues,
such as a respiratory condition, recovery may take weeks and in severe cases
could be potentially fatal.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="herd-immunity">Herd immunity</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">Herd immunity</a> is the effect
that, if enough people are immune to a disease, it doesn't spread. This "it
doesn't spread" is hard for me to define more precisely, because it can be that
other people get infected. Just not in an amount which is relevant for the
complete herd.</p>
<p>I tried to find numbers when heard immunity kicks in. According to <sup id="fnref2:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>, it would be 60% - 70%.</p>

<h2 id="predictions-for-germany">Predictions for Germany</h2>
<p>Fitting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function">generalized logistic function</a></p>
<p>$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-b \cdot x + c}}$$</p>
<p>to the data from 2020-02-24 to 2020-03-23 in order to get the total number of
infected people gave the following results.</p>
<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p>I assumend that at most 64 million people can (and will) become infected.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the data is not fixed. If a person gets the results of
the test later, the numbers for a given day might be corrected. And the
corrections are huge.</p>
<p>For 2020-03-20:</p>
<ul>
<li>12,890: What I got from en-wiki at 2020-03-23</li>
<li>13,957: What I see on en-wiki at 2020-03-25 (08:25)</li>
<li>18,361: <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1102667/umfrage/erkrankungs-und-todesfaelle-aufgrund-des-coronavirus-in-deutschland/">statista.com</a> (2020-03-25 08:25)</li>
<li>19,850: <a href="https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/">Berliner Morgenpost</a> (2020-03-25 08:25)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the range is 6960 cases. The highest number is 54% higher than the lowest
one. With such extrem corrections of the current numbers, the predictions must
be pretty bad.</p>
<p>Naturally, the model also does not know about any changes like quarantine or
self-isolation. One could analogize to other countries, but I was too lazy
to implement that.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's see when the predictions start to fall apart. They will, because the
training data does not contain the isolation and also there isn't a lot of
training data for Germany.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://gist.github.com/MartinThoma/e35d7ee2cdf288be090ffc822bb53f1b">predictions from 2020-03-23</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Date: Total infections at the end of the day (new infections on that day)
2020-03-24: 28,451 (+5,109) -- was 29,542
2020-03-25: 34,678 (+6,226)
2020-03-26: 42,266 (+7,588)
2020-03-27: 51,513 (+9,247)  -- somewhat accurate until here
2020-03-28: 62,781 (+11,268)
2020-03-29: 76,512 (+13,730)  -- pretty bad from here
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, 2020-03-31, the following regression fits way better. This means the
growth rate was reduced from 19.8% to 15.1%. I'm more positive than the
estimator. I guess we don't have enough data for the quarantine. It would make
most sense to me to analogize with Italy.</p>
<p>Anyway, here you are with the bad estimators estimates:</p>

<h2 id="side-effects">Side-Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online Services</strong>: Companies are highly incentivized to check their remote
  working capabilities, schools and universities have to think about which
  materials they offer online, libraries increase their e-book offer. Even
  churches start to stream the church service. I hope that this permanently
  increases the online material. There are always people who can't leave their
  house. People who might be too old or people who need to stay at hospital.
  There are always people who have time for this at that specific moment.
  People who work multiple jobs or are simply working at other shifts. Adding
  material online makes our society more inclusive.</li>
<li><strong>Social Contact</strong>: Yes, we cannot see each other. But at least I started to
  contact more friends and talk more often with family. I'm not the only one
  who does that (<a href="https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/In-Deutschland-wird-mehr-und-laenger-telefoniert-4688664.html">German
  source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Weather Forcasting</strong>: Aparently planes have sensors and contribute their
  data to global weather forecasting. Now that less planes fly, forecasting
  becomes harder. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-Aeolus">ADM-Aeolus</a> might help.</li>
<li><strong>No school shootings</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertKlemko/status/1249716012599083010">See Twitter</a> -
  I'm not sure if that is related.</li>
