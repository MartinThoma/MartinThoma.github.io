I thought MP3 players were basically a solved problem, meaning they are only
improved in price, storage capacity and battery.

However, there are some design flaws with a new MP3 player I recently got. In
this post I just want to collect some design ideas which I think are important.

Physical features:

* Dedicated volume button (up and down)
* On-off switch which does not easily get pushed by accident (e.g. a switch, not a button)
* A single "start / stop" button
* Nav
* Illuminated display which is big enough to show battery, current title,
  playback time. No need to be able to play videos.
* Standard plug for headphones.
* Standard Smartphone USB slot (micro-b?) for charging and transfering data.
* microSD card slot which accepts at least 32GB cards.

Software features:

* When the MP3 player is shut down while playing an MP3, it should save where
  it was and play it from this point (or rather 5 seconds earlier) when it is
  turned on again.
* Allow to play playlist files (but not to create them on the device).
* Act as a simple USB stick when connected to a computer. No special file
  system should be necessary.
