## Paper clips

Have a glass of water and some paper clips. The challenge is to place at least one paper clip so that it floats on the water.

The solution is to bend one paper clip to an L-Shape and then slowly placing another paper clip on the water. The surface tension makes it float.


## Straws

### Triangle

Melt two straws together. Use a third straw to make it a triangle. The challenge is to lift the whole triangle without melting anything with a fourth straw.

The solution is to place the fourth straw between the two melted ones and the third one. Push the two melted ones a bit away, so that the third one falls in between the two melted ones. Now you can push it up.


## Balloon

Put a lot of salt on a plate. Put some pepper on it. The challenge is to separate 99% of the pepper from the salt without touching it.

The solution is to use static electricty. Blow up the balloon, rub it on your shirt and let the balloon grab the pepper.


## Kahlua

Every bar which offers a white russian has cream and Kahlua. Order a shot of cream and a shot of Kahlua. Put a business card on top of the Kahlua-shot, switch the Kahlua upside down and put it on the cream glass
