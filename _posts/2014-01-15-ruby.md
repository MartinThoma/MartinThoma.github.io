I'm currently learning Ruby to improve my Jekyll blog. At the moment,
I can't really say if I like Ruby.

Just like PHP and Python, Ruby is implicitly typed. This means you
can do the following:

```ruby
# A list
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
# An integer
b = 42
# A floating point number
c = 3.141
```

Ruby is also dynamically typed:

```ruby
a = 42
a = "now a is a string!"
```

One thing that is pretty annoying is the usage of `begin ... end`.
I thought LaTeX was the only "language" in use that had this syntax.

<h2>Syntax examples</h2>
<h3>If, else if, else</h3>
```ruby
a = 1

if a == 1 || a % 2 == 0
    puts "a equals 1 or is even"
elsif a == 3
    puts "a equals 3"
else
    puts "a does not equal 1 or 3 and is not even"
end
```

<h3>String manipulation</h3>
String manipulation is weird in Ruby. Take a look at the last example.
What would you expect?

```ruby
s = "0123456789"
puts s[2..4]
puts s[2..s.length()]
puts s[2..-2]
```

Output is:

```
234
23456789
2345678
```

Now what would you expect to happen with `"0123456789"[2..4]`?
I would expect Ruby to give `"234"`. But this one actually fails.

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
Dictionaries, which are sometimes also called 'maps' or 'associative 
arrays' are a neat data structure. Ruby uses this syntax:

```ruby
dictionary = {"a"=> 7, "b"=> "x"}

if dictionary.has_key?("a")
    puts "key 'a' is in dictionary! It is " + dictionary["a"].to_s
    dictionary["a"] = 42
    puts "Now it is " + dictionary["a"].to_s
    puts dictionary.size()
    puts dictionary.length()
    puts dictionary.count()
end
```

<h3>map</h3>
```ruby
myList = [1,2,3,4,5]
x = myList.map{|element| [element,element+1]}
x.each do |a, b|
    puts "a: " + a.to_s + ", b: " + b.to_s
end
```

will print

```bash
a: 1, b: 2
a: 2, b: 3
a: 3, b: 4
a: 4, b: 5
a: 5, b: 6
```

<h3>.count(), .length(), .size()</h3>
At a first glance, those three seem to be aliases. But `.count()`
is not quite the same as `.length()` and `.size()` ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4550797/562769)).

<h3>Blocks</h3>
A very interesting idea in Ruby is that of blocks. It seems to be
similar to Pythons decorators:

```ruby
def time_method(method=nil, *args)
  beginning_time = Time.now
  if block_given?
    yield
  else
    self.send(method, args)
  end
  end_time = Time.now
  puts "Time elapsed #{(end_time - beginning_time)*1000} milliseconds"
end
 
time_method do
  (1..10000).each { |i| i }
end
```

## Logging

Logging in Ruby is very convenient. See [Logger Documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html)

## Notable libraries and projects

### Nokogiri: Parsing HTML
The following code will parse `yourHTMLcode` and select all `a`-tags
(also known as links):

```ruby
require 'nokogiri'

doc = Nokogiri::HTML.parse(yourHTMLcode)
links = doc.css('a').map { |link| [link['href'],link.text] }
links.each do |link, linktext|
    puts "Link '"+link+"' was used with '"+linktext+"'"
 end
```

### Sequel
This way you can select elements from a SQLite-Database:

```ruby
require 'sequel'

db = Sequel.sqlite("search.db")
rows = db.fetch( "SELECT rowid FROM pages WHERE url='/imprint';" ).all
#puts rows
#puts rows.count()
puts rows[0][:rowid]
```
