Finding good solutions to have a phone number and decent internet when being in
another country is a annoying task. For this reason, I wrote the following
article: To help students who come to Germany.


## General overview

In Germany, pre-paid sim cards are pretty good compared to contracts. Well-known
providers of pre-paid cards are:

* Discounters
    * [Aldi Talk](https://www.alditalk.de/)
    * [Lidl Connect](https://www.lidl.de/de/lidl-connect/s7373597)
* Online
    * [blau.de](https://www.blau.de/) (former "simyo")
    * [simquardat.de](https://www.simquadrat.de/)


## How to get Lidl Connect card

1. Go to a Lidl store. Near the check-out, there are small cardboard cards.
   When you paid for it, they will give you a similar small "box". This box
   contains the sim card (standard, micro and nano) as well as instructions
   (German only)
2. Go to [Lidl Connect](https://www.lidl.de/de/lidl-connect/s7373597) and
   register a new account with the card you just bought.
3. The card gets activated within 30 minutes.
4. You can login at [https://kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de/](kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de)
