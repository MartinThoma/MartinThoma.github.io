## Math is beautiful

<h2>Math is important</h2>
If you are interested in natural science, you will defenitely need math. Here are a few examples where math is directly needed:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Computer Science</strong>: All kinds of animations, stochastics is needed often, cryptography needs number theory</li>
  <li><strong>Physics</strong>: a lot of analysis seems to be needed, differential equations are used if processes are depend on time</li>
  <li><strong>Chemistry</strong>, <strong>Biology</strong>, <strong>Medicine</strong>, <strong>Psychology</strong>: again stochastics for interpreting results of experiments</li>
  <li><strong>economic science</strong>: modelling - I don't know anything about economic science, but I've heard they need differential equations</li>
</ul>

Although I guess you could continue this list, but the most important reason is that it teaches you how to think logically.

## Money

Not knowing mathematics can cost you money. An obvious example is:
