<h2>Anamorphic Art</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis">Anamorphosis</a> is a distorted projection or perspective requiring the viewer to use special devices or occupy a specific vantage point to reconstitute the image. 

Here is a good example by <a href="http://www.varini.org/">Felice Varini</a>:

<h2>Pavement Drawings</h2>
Pavement Drawings can be combined with anamorphic art. One great artist I've found is <a href="http://www.julianbeever.net/pave.htm">Julian Beever</a>. Here is one example:

<h2>Hand Painting</h2>
You might already know body painting. <a href="http://www.guidodaniele.com/?page_id=8">Guido Daniele</a> does something very simmilar he calls "Hand Painting". Here is one example:
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="509" caption="Hand Painting by Guido Daniele" url="../images/2012/02/hand-art-guido-daniele.jpg" alt="Hand Painting by Guido Daniele"  height="340" class="size-full wp-image-15571" %}

<h2>Hair Sculptures</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Wigan">Willard Wigan</a> is a sculptor from Birmingham, England, who makes microscopic art. His sculptures are typically placed in the eye of a needle or on the head of a pin. A single sculpture can be as small as 0.005 mm. Here is an example from his <a href="http://www.willard-wigan.com/gallery.aspx">gallery</a>: 
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="Harry Potter by Willard Wigan" url="../images/2012/02/Harry-Potter.jpg" alt="Harry Potter by Willard Wigan"  height="319" class="size-full wp-image-15601" %}

<h2>Sand Art</h2>
It is amazing what can be done with sand. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshan_Pattnaik">Sudarsan Pattnaik</a> created this sculpture:
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="469" caption="Sand Art: Global Warming by Sudarshan Pattnaik" url="../images/2012/02/sand-art-global-warming-sudarshan-pattnaik.jpg" alt="Sand Art: Global Warming by Sudarshan Pattnaik"  height="313" class="size-full wp-image-15621" %}

<h2>Origami</h2>
Robert J. Lang seems to invest a serious amount of time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami">Origami</a>. His <a href="http://www.langorigami.com/art/gallery/gallery.php?tag=mammals&name=bull_moose">gallery of mammals</a> is very impressive. Here is a moose:

<h2>Domino Day</h2>
This is not done by one artist, but it should be mentioned:
