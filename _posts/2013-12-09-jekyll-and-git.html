You've probably noticed that I didn't write any posts the last 
few weeks. The reason is that I've migrated my WordPress Blog to
Jekyll.

<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a static blog generator.

<h2>Jekyll compared with WordPress</h2>
<p>Jekyll is a static site generator. This means you have the
source files on your computer. Then you generate the website
with Jekyll and upload only the generated files. So you only push
content to the server, but you don't have to download anything from
the server.</p>

Reasons for Jekyll:
<ul>
  <li><b>Security</b>: With Jekyll, you only upload static files (HTML, CSS, 
      JavaScript, Images, ...). There is nothing where the user
      can pass some data. This also means there is one thing less
      to update.<br/>
      Assuming your provider updates your server software (e.g. Apache)
      you don't have to update anything. In contrast, when you don't
      regularly install updates on your WordPress blog (and hope
      that those updates don't break anything), your blog is quite
      likely to be hacked.</li>
  <li><b>Speed</b>: The webserver needs only to serve the sites.
      Nothing else. Of course, when you use caching with PHP you
      might get into a similar situation with WordPress. But it
      will never be faster.</li>
  <li><b>Hosting</b>: You only need webspace. This reduces hosting
      cost significantly. Additionally, you can use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
      for hosting!</li>
  <li><b>Backups</b>: Creating security backups is VERY easy with
      Jekyll. Every tool that can make bakups of files can backup
      your Jekyll blog. No need to worry about databases. If a file
      is corrupt, only that file is affected. No worries about
      maximum execution time for importing / exporting backups.
      No need to get SSH access. Simple FTP access does the job.</li>
</ul>

Reasons for WordPress:
<ul>
  <li><b>Comments</b>: There is no way to get comments only with
      static pages. So you need something else, e.g. <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Search</b>: Could probably be done with JavaScript, but
      I guess it is difficult.</li>
  <li><b>RSS Feeds</b>: WordPress generates valid RSS feeds, Jekyll 
      does not (according to <a href="validator.w3.org/feed/">validator.w3.org/feed</a>,
      tested with <a href="http://martinthoma.github.io/feed">this Jekyll feed</a>
      generated by <a href="http://github.com/agelber/jekyll-rss">jekyll-rss</a>
      and <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/feed">that WordPress feed</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Editor</b>: WordPress gives you a WYSIWYG editor. I don't 
      know if there is something similar for Jekyll.</li>
  <li><b>Compile time</b>: Compilation time is very long for Jekyll.
      For my blog, it needs over 6 minutes. As I test the result
      quite often before I publish posts, this is very annoying.</li>
  <li><b>Tagging, Category pages, Author pages</b>: Currently,
      Jekyll lacks basic support for blogging. You don't have tag
      pages per default, the plugins that provide tags don't have 
      paginated tag index pages. The same problem occurs when it comes
      to categories or authors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create your repository</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, sign in and
      create a new repo:
  </li>
  <li>Call it `[Username].github.io`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Branches</h2>
Go to your Git repository that cointains your blog:

{% highlight bash %}
moose@pc08 ~/Downloads/MartinThoma.github.io $ ls
_config.yml  favicon.ico  index.html  Makefile  Readme.md
css          images       js          _plugins  _site
_drafts      _includes    _layouts    _posts    thumbs
{% endhighlight %}

Now you should create a new branch that will contain your source files.
The following command creates a branch `sources` that starts where
the branch `master` currently is:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b source master
{% endhighlight %}

Now update this branch to the server:

{% highlight bash %}
git push -u origin source
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Markdown</h2>
`rdiscount` to `redcarpet`

<h3>Linebreaks and newline</h3>

<h2>Customization</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">Example for a liquid filter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Make the Website super-fast</h2>
<h3>CSS Minification</h3>
{% highlight bash %}
sudo gem install juicer
juicer install jslint
juicer install yui_compressor
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>I've included small images as base64 (used <a href="http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter/Create">this online tool</a>).
According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/datauri">caniuse</a> it's
quite save to use.</p>

<h2>Site Search</h2>
Site search was a real problem.

<h2>Some tests</h2>
<p>I like <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools</a>
to get some information about my site (number of requests, load time, page size, ...)</p>

<p><a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/">WichLoadsFaster.com</a>
is also nice, because it lets me compare my old site to my new site.</p>
