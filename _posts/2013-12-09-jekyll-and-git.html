You've probably noticed that I didn't write any posts the last 
few weeks. The reason is that I've migrated my WordPress Blog to
Jekyll.

<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a static blog generator.

<h2>Jekyll compared with WordPress</h2>
Jekyll is a static site generator. 

Reasons for Jekyll:
<ul>
  <li><b>Security</b>: With Jekyll, you only upload static files (HTML, CSS, 
      JavaScript, Images, ...). There is nothing where the user
      can pass some data.</li>
  <li><b>Speed</b>: The webserver needs only to serve the sites.
      Nothing else. Of course, when you use caching with PHP you
      might get into a similar situation with WordPress. But it
      will never be faster.</li>
  <li><b>Hosting</b>: You only need webspace. This reduces hosting
      cost significantly. Additionally, you can use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
      for hosting!</li>
  <li><b>Backups</b>: Creating security backups is VERY easy with
      Jekyll. Every tool that can make bakups of files can backup
      your Jekyll blog. No need to worry about databases. If a file
      is corrupt, only that file is affected. No worries about
      maximum execution time for importing / exporting backups.
      No need to get SSH access. Simple FTP access does the job.</li>
</ul>

Reasons for WordPress:
<ul>
  <li><b>Comments</b>: There is no way to get comments only with
      static pages. So you need something else, e.g. <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Search</b>: Could probably be done with JavaScript, but
      I guess it is difficult.</li>
  <li><b>RSS Feeds</b>: WordPress generates valid RSS feeds, Jekyll 
      does not (according to <a href="validator.w3.org/feed/">validator.w3.org/feed</a>,
      tested with <a href="http://martinthoma.github.io/feed">this Jekyll feed</a>
      generated by <a href="http://github.com/agelber/jekyll-rss">jekyll-rss</a>
      and <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/feed">that WordPress feed</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Editor</b>: WordPress gives you a WYSIWYG editor. I don't 
      know if there is something similar for Jekyll.</li>
  <li><b>Compile time</b>: Compilation time is very long for Jekyll.
      For my blog, it needs about 5 minutes. As I test the result
      quite often before I publish posts, this is very annoying.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create your repository</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, sign in and
      create a new repo:
  </li>
  <li>Call it `[Username].github.io`.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Branches</h2>
Go to your Git repository that cointains your blog:

{% highlight bash %}
moose@pc08 ~/Downloads/MartinThoma.github.io $ ls
_config.yml  favicon.ico  index.html  Makefile  Readme.md
css          images       js          _plugins  _site
_drafts      _includes    _layouts    _posts    thumbs
{% endhighlight %}

Now you should create a new branch that will contain your source files.
The following command creates a branch `sources` that starts where
the branch `master` currently is:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout -b source master
{% endhighlight %}

Now update this branch to the server:

{% highlight bash %}
git push -u origin source
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Customization</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">Example for a liquid filter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Make the Website super-fast</h2>
<h3>CSS Minification</h3>
{% highlight bash %}
sudo gem install juicer
juicer install jslint
juicer install yui_compressor
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Images</h3>
I've included small images as base64 (used <a href="http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter/Create">this online tool</a>).
According to <a href="http://caniuse.com/datauri">caniuse</a> it's
quite save to use.

<h2>Some tests</h2>
I like <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools</a>
to get some information about my site (number of requests, load time, page size, ...)

<a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/">WichLoadsFaster.com</a>
is also nice, because it lets me compare my old site to my new site.
