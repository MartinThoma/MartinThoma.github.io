The [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is an experiment
that was proposed by Alan Turing to test the ability of an artificial
intelligence to emulate intelligent behaviour. It works like this:

A human judge gets to talk over a chat client with either a human he doesn't
know or a chat robot. If the judge can distinguish the human from the chat
robot, the chat robot isn't intelligent.

(There is a lot more to say about the Turing test. If you're really interested,
you should read the wikipedia article.)

Let's see how long it takes for me to say that I'm either talking to a very
dumb person or to a computer for various chat robots

> judge: So we do â˜º 
> ALICE: Really.. I'm glad you find this amusing. 
> judge: What is 7+3? 
> ALICE: Use a calculator! 
> judge: What was my last question? 
> ALICE: Is this a trick question? 
> judge: No. 
> ALICE: It seems like a trick to me.

| Check     | Difficulty | How the Chatbot performed            | Stars  |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Greetings | Easy       | He greated just as I've expected it. | 5 / 5  |
| Smalltalk | Average    | He did not keep the talk running and he always answer the same way to smilies. | 3 / 5  |
| Tasks     | Average    | He avoided the task. Which is ok.    | 4 / 5  |
| Back reference | Hard  | Asking for a trick question and for rephrasing might be a good way to get the human to give the context in one chat message. Very good! | 3 / 5 |

| Greetings | Easy       | He didn't greet at the beginning.    | 2 / 5  |
| Smalltalk | Average    | Quite ok.                            | 4 / 5  |

This one tried to lead the conversation. I think that might be a good way to
emulate a human. Either don't talk or keep talking all the time so that you
(your chatbot) know the context.
