Do you know the difference between MIT-license and BSD license? I don't. And I don't want to read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>, although it is very short. And I definitely don't want to read the <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Apache2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.

Instead of reading all licenses, you could first read <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/24/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/">A Short Guide To Open-Source And Similar Licenses</a>.

Even shorter: <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">TL;DR - Open Source Licenses Explained in Plain English</a>.

Licenses are important for OpenSource, because if you don't provide a license, nobody may use your source (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13669816/562769">source</a>). So even if everybody can see your code, it is not OpenSource if you don't choose an OpenSource license.

I think Jeff Atwood has written an article about the fact, that many GitHub projects are not OpenSource due to a missing license. Sadly, I don't find the article. But here is another one by him: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html">Pick a License, Any License</a>
