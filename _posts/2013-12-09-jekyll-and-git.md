You've probably noticed that I didn't write any posts the last few 
weeks. The reason is that I've migrated my WordPress Blog to Jekyll. 
This means it takes some source files and generates purely static 
pages from that. The generation process is independant of user 
requests.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a static blog generator, just like
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde),
[nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

## Jekyll compared with WordPress ##
Jekyll is a static site generator. This means you have the
source files on your computer. Then you generate the website
with Jekyll and upload only the generated files. So you only push
content to the server, but you don't have to download anything from
the server.

Reasons for Jekyll:
<ul>
  <li>**Security**: With Jekyll, you only upload static files (HTML, 
      CSS, JavaScript, Images, ...). There is nothing where the user 
      can pass some data. This also means there is one thing less to 
      update.<br/>
      Assuming your provider updates your server software (e.g. Apache)
      you don't have to update anything. In contrast, when you don't
      regularly install updates on your WordPress blog (and hope
      that those updates don't break anything), your blog is quite
      likely to be hacked.</li>
  <li>**Speed**: The webserver needs only to serve the sites.
      Nothing else. Of course, when you use caching with PHP you
      might get into a similar situation with WordPress. But it
      will never be faster.</li>
  <li>**Hosting**: You only need webspace. This reduces hosting
      cost significantly. Additionally, you can use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
      for hosting!</li>
  <li>**Backups**: Creating security backups is VERY easy with
      Jekyll. Every tool that can make bakups of files can backup
      your Jekyll blog. No need to worry about databases. If a file
      is corrupt, only that file is affected. No worries about
      maximum execution time for importing / exporting backups.
      No need to get SSH access. Simple FTP access does the job.</li>
</ul>

Reasons for WordPress:
<ul>
  <li>**Comments**: There is no way to get comments only with
      static pages. So you need something else, e.g. <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>.</li>
  <li>**Search**: Could probably be done with JavaScript, but
      I guess it is difficult.</li>
  <li>**RSS Feeds**: WordPress generates valid RSS feeds, Jekyll 
      does not (according to <a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/">validator.w3.org/feed</a>,
      tested with <a href="http://martinthoma.github.io/feed">this Jekyll feed</a>
      generated by <a href="http://github.com/agelber/jekyll-rss">jekyll-rss</a>
      and <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/feed">that WordPress feed</a>).</li>
  <li>**Editor**: WordPress gives you a WYSIWYG editor. I don't 
      know if there is something similar for Jekyll.</li>
  <li>**Compile time**: Compilation time is very long for Jekyll.
      For my blog, it needs over 6 minutes. As I test the result
      quite often before I publish posts, this is very annoying.</li>
  <li>**Tagging, Category pages, Author pages**: Currently,
      Jekyll lacks basic support for blogging. You don't have tag
      pages per default, the plugins that provide tags don't have 
      paginated tag index pages. The same problem occurs when it comes
      to categories or authors.</li>
  <li>**Timed posts**: I did not use timed posts very often, but
      it is very easy to create them with WordPress. With Jekyll,
      on the other hand, you have to know how to create cronjobs.
      And your computer has to be running.</li>
</ul>

## GitHub ##
### Create your repository ###
1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, sign in and create a new repo:
2. Call it `[Username].github.io`.

### Branches ###
The way to use Jekyll with GitHub is by using branches.
Go to your Git repository that cointains your blog:

```bash
moose@pc08 ~/Downloads/MartinThoma.github.io $ ls
_config.yml  favicon.ico  index.html  Makefile  Readme.md
css          images       js          _plugins  _site
_drafts      _includes    _layouts    _posts    thumbs
```

Now you should create a new branch that will contain your source files.
The following command creates a branch `sources` that starts where
the branch `master` currently is:

```bash
git checkout -b source master
```

Now update this branch to the server:

```bash
git push -u origin source
```

When you enter

```bash
git checkout . master
```

you will switch to the `master` brach. The same way you can switch
to the `source` branch. After you've entered the command, you can
look at the folder in your file system. There will only be the data
of the current branch.

### Custom Domain ###
If you want to host your content at GitHub, but have a custom Domain
like `martin-thoma.com` instead of `martinthoma.github.io`, you
have to:

1. Ask your provider (in my case "Knallhart") to add an A-record to
   Github.
2. Add a file called `CNAME` with content `martin-thoma.com`
   (yes, without `http://`) to the root of your directory

GitHub also offers some help on [setting up a custom domain with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

## FTP Server ##
If you have your own FTP server, you probably want to use it.

One tool that might now come to your mind is `rsync`. But rsync 
needs SSH ([source](http://serverfault.com/a/24627/113899)). If you
have SSH, then you can do something like this:

```bash
rsync -avz --delete _site/ user@host:/path/to/web/root
```

The `--delete` options "delete[s] extraneous files from dest dirs",
`-a` means archive which preserves the owner, group, change date
and some more of files, `-v` is verbose as always and `-z` is for
compression while the file transfer happens. `--progress` might also
be interesting, especially for the first upload.

Otherwise, you might want to try `curlftpfs`. This program lets you
mount a FTP folder:

```bash
curlftpfs ftp.example.com/backups /mnt/ftpserver
```

and you can also umount it:

```bash
rsync --delete /var/backups /mnt/ftpserver
```

## Markdown ##
I've switched between `rdiscount` and `redcarpet`. The former is
faster, the latter supports fenced code blocks. I finally stuck with
redcarped, because Liquid has problems when it comes to C++ for loops
after curly braces.

Other Markdown parsers are `maruku` (which has a 
[Multiple lines for HTML &lt;li&gt;-tag](https://github.com/bhollis/maruku/issues/121)
issue) and `kramdown` (which is slow).

### Linebreaks and newline ###
Linebreaks are an issue. Sometimes I want to get a `<br/>`, sometimes
I make linebreaks to make reading of the text files easier. It's
basically [this discussion](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/26011/should-the-markdown-renderer-treat-a-single-line-break-as-br).

Currently, I'm not satisfied with the situation. I never had that
problem with WordPress. WordPress simply created paragraphs just at
the right location.

## Customization ##
You can create [custom Liquid filters](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/),
plugins and templates. Everything is quite easy. The Liquid templating
language seems to be very similar to Django Templates (Python).

## Make the Website super-fast ##
### CSS Minification ###
```bash
sudo gem install juicer
juicer install jslint
juicer install yui_compressor
```

### Images ###
I've included small images as base64 (used [this online tool](http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter/Create)). According to [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/datauri) it's quite save to use.

## Site Search ##
Site search is a real problem. I've seen three solutions so far:

1. **Dynamic Search**: You can add a dynamic part to your statically
   generated website. For example, I create a `search/index.php` and
   a SQLite database.
2. **Static JavaScript**: Create a JSON file or something similar and
   search dynamically with JavaScript in it.
3. **External Search Engines**: You could use a search engine for 
   searching your site, of course.

          to parse your website

### PHP+SQLite ###

### JavaScript solutions ###
One JavaScript solution I've found is [lunr](https://github.com/slashdotdash/jekyll-lunr-js-search).
This one is really bad as it copies the whole body to a json file.
This json file has to be loaded before it works. But my posts total
at the moment to 2MB. I'm pretty sure my readers don't want to wait
until 2MB are downloaded. So this one does only work for smaller
websites.

[Christan Fei's solution](http://christian-fei.com/simple-jekyll-search-jquery-plugin/)
does only search in the title and category.

# Templates #
Jekyll uses Liquid as a templating language. It is similar to Django
templates. [Here](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
is a short introduction to Liquid.

## Some tests ##
I like <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom Tools</a> to get some information about my site (number of requests, load time, page size, ...).

<a href="http://whichloadsfaster.com/">WichLoadsFaster.com</a> is also nice, because it lets me compare my old site to my new site.
