When you're studying or researching, there a quite a couple of tools which come
in very handy in various situations. In the last 5&nbsp;years at university I
got to know quite a few, so I want to share my list with you.


## Discovery

Sometimes, I just like to stumble around some papers. I'm not actively
searching anything, but just looking for something interesting. In my field
of research, [gitxiv.com](http://gitxiv.com/) is really interesting for that.
But also the [recent papers at arXiv](http://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent).

I know that a couple of people recently liked
[arxitics.com](http://arxitics.com/) and
[control.kylemcdonald.net/arxiv](http://control.kylemcdonald.net/arxiv/), but
I'm not using that too much.

## Search

When I'm actively searching for papers where you know keywords,
[scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.de/) is the search engine of my
choice. [academic.microsoft.com](https://academic.microsoft.com) could be
an interesting alternative.


## Summaries and Explanations

A site which I discovered in the beginning of 2016 is
[shortscience.org](http://www.shortscience.org/). It gives you the possibility
to save and share your summaries of papers. Have a look at
[my profile](http://www.shortscience.org/user?name=MartinThoma) if you're
interested. The service is still in its early stages, but I like it very much.

[Scholarpedia.org](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Main_Page) is a site
where you can finde some high-quality explanations. If I remember right, Hinton
wrote some articles on Scholarpedia.

Of course, Wikipedia is always an option to get introduced to basics.


## Writing

I do the actual writing with [Sublime Text](https://martin-thoma.com/sublime-text/).

### Typesetting

The typesetting system of my choice is
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). It produces beautiful results,
especially for mathematical formulae. A couple of years ago I wrote some
[installation instructions](https://martin-thoma.com/how-to-install-the-latest-latex-version/).
If you need help with something specific,
[tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) is really nice.

If you're only looking for a symbol to write with LaTeX, I can recommend
[write-math.com](http://write-math.com).
[Other options](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/14/5645) are available, too.


### Content

If I have questions about academic writing (the content), then
[academia.stackexchange.com](http://academia.stackexchange.com/) is the site
of my choice.


### Spell- and Stylechecking

I use [`aspell`](http://aspell.net/) for spellchecking and
[Academic-Writing-Check](https://github.com/devd/Academic-Writing-Check) to get
some ideas where I might improve my writing style.


### Reference Management

I like [JabRef](https://martin-thoma.com/reference-management-with-jabref/) as
it is in the standard repositories of Ubuntu and works out of the box to
manage my references. I use it to fill my BibTeX files and add as much content
to papers as I can. JabRef also has some nice options to find / open the paper
for yourself.


### Publishing

[arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/) is one of the best places to publish your paper
quickly. Even faster, but a lot less reach has
[zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/). The nice thing about Zenodo is that you can
share datasets, too.

Zenodo also gives all your uploads a DOI and offers visitors various ways to
cite it. For example, for my [HWRT database](https://zenodo.org/record/50022)
the BibTeX entry is

```tex
@misc{thoma_2015_50022,
  author       = {Thoma, Martin},
  title        = {HWRT database of handwritten symbols},
  month        = jan,
  year         = 2015,
  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.50022},
  url          = {http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.50022}
}
```


## Building a Profile

I'm not sure how important this is in Science, but there are some social
networks for researchers.

[ORCiD](http://orcid.org/) is one site which aims to give researchers unique
numbers so that you can track who wrote what, even if people are in the same
field of research and have the same names. It also allows you to add a CV as
you can see with [my ORCiD](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690).

Google Scholar offers a simple version of that, too. See
[my profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=u52T6MYAAAAJ) or
the [profile of Hinton](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JicYPdAAAAAJ).
