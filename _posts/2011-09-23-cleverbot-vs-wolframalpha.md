<a href="http://cleverbot.com/" title="Cleverbot">Cleverbot</a> is an AI web application. You can chat with it and it tries to guess a good answer. This can be quite funny.

I was curious how Cleverbot would answer when I compared it to <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" title="answer engine">Wolfram|Alpha</a>, a useful answering engine.

Here are two of my conversations:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="323" alt="Cleverbot" caption="Cleverbot" url="../images/2011/09/Cleverbot-2.png" %}

This Cleverbot isn't very clever...
