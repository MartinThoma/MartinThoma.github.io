Most of you might know that I am currently a student. Living near the University is quite important for me as I hate traveling long. In the central part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a>, the city I study in, most houses are very old. The house I live in was built around 1900 and modernized from time to time. A heater and electricity were added, for example.

The flat is shared by students. My hirer told me that he will pay all cost of materials if I wanted to improve something. As a new leaser came and we had no washing machine we thought it was time to renovate the kitchen.
<h2>The old kitchen</h2>
<h3>Why did I renovate?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We needed more space for a new washing machine.</li>
	<li>The old countertop was ugly, molded and had a water damage.</li>
	<li>The tap was loose.</li>
	<li>The tube for hot water was loose.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some photos</h3>

<h2>The renovation</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
I needed quite a lot of tools. I had to buy most of them when I saw that I couldn't continue without them:

Additionally I needed a hammer to get the wall plugs into the wall, some different screws and wall plugs, pliers, some tubes and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring">O-rings</a>.

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="To save some money and to be sure that it really fits, I waited with the renovation until the washing machine was delivered.

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="As I removed the old countertop, I saw that a tube was loose. This had to be fixed.

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Adding a working ledge is very important. It gives your countertop the needed stability and you can make sure that it&#039;s exactly horizontally.

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="You have to connect both countertops very good. If you don&#039;t do so, you will get water in there which will destroy the countertop over time.

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="259" caption="This little metal plate fixates the tap to the countertop. I put it for two days into vinegar to get rid of most of the rust, dirt and chalk. Before I did so, the whole plate was brown." url="../images/2011/10/kitchen-working-tab-259x300.jpg" alt="The tab was fixed to the countertop." title="The tab was fixed to the countertop." height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-4831" %}

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Angle joints fix the countertop to the wall. I used 23 angle joints with 46 screws.

<h2>The new kitchen</h2>

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Exact work: It fitted only with a few milimeters left. Good that I added some space to make sure it will fit. If I made the plate exactly as big as it could have been according to my first plan, I would have been in trouble." url="../images/2011/10/kitchen-after-exact-work-300x225.jpg" alt="Exact work: It fitted only with a few milimeters left" title="Exact work: It fitted only with a few milimeters left" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-4771" %}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I am proud of the result. The new kitchen looks nice, the countertop is very exact horizontally, no water drips out. Some parts could have been done better (like the silicone clogging), but I guess most could not be much better.

The next time I do something like this I will hopefully not have to go about ten times to the hardware store :-/ Now I have some more tools :D
