<strong>Task</strong>: Find a city on a map
<strong>How to play</strong>: You're given the name of a city and its country and a map. In the first levels this map has borders, but no names of countries or cities. In the later levels even the borders are not shown.
<strong>My Record</strong>: Level 6, about 1400 points
