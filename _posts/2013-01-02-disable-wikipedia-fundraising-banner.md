I didn't spend this year for Wikipedia because of the advertising. It really got on my nerves:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Wikipedia advertising - Fundraising campaign" url="../images/2013/01/wikipedia-advertising-300x85.png" alt="Wikipedia advertising - Fundraising campaign"  height="85" class="size-medium wp-image-53041" %}

But you can simply disable it:
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="How to disable Wikipedia fundraiser" url="../images/2013/01/wikipedia-disable-fundraiser-300x153.png" alt="How to disable Wikipedia fundraiser"  height="153" class="size-medium wp-image-53051" %}

You only have to go to:

Preferences &rarr; Gadgets tab &rarr; Browsing &rarr; check "Suppress display of the fundraiser banner"

Now I'm happy :-)
