THIS IS JUST A DRAFT. IT WILL GET UPDATED UNTIL 15 NOVEMBER 2014!

On-line handwriting recognition systems get the information how a symbol is
written. In contrast, OCR only gets the pixel map.

I've created a system that can be used to work with handwriting recognition
systems in my bachelor's thesis.

## write-math.com

The website [write-math.com](http://write-math.com) was used to collect data.
The source is at [github.com/MartinThoma/write-math](https://github.com/MartinThoma/write-math).

## HWRT toolkit

The [`hwrt`](https://github.com/MartinThoma/hwrt) toolkit was created to
work with on-line handwritten symbols. The toolkit is documented at
[pythonhosted.org/hwrt](https://pythonhosted.org/hwrt/).

The raw data can be downloaded with this toolkit.

## HWR experiments

All experiments configuration files are saved in the project
[github.com/MartinThoma/hwr-experiments](https://github.com/MartinThoma/hwr-experiments).
