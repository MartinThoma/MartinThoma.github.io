<h2>Buying it</h2>
You can buy a Nexus 4 in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(store)">Saturn</a>, but the 16GB-version costs 395 Euro there (<a href="http://www.saturn.de/mcs/product/LG-Nexus-4-16-GB,48352,365082,523287.html?langId=-3">source</a>). In Google Play Store, it costs "only" 349 Euro (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_4_16GB?id=nexus_4_16gb">source</a>). 

<h3>Comdirect</h3>
So, I've decided to buy it from Google Play Store. But you have to have a <a href="http://www.google.de/wallet/">Google Wallet</a> account to use it. For a Google Wallet account, you need a credit card. Unlike in the USA, most people in Germany don't have a credit card. I had to get one and decided to use the free one from <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comdirect">Comdirect</a>.

Here is a list of letters I got ... I've expected one or two.

<dl>

The Meldebest&auml;tigung costs 8.00 Euro.</dd>

</dl>

[caption id="attachment_60371" align="aligncenter" width="290"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/comdirect-karten-irrsinn.jpg"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/comdirect-karten-irrsinn-290x300.jpg" alt="Three cards I got from one bank" width="290" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-60371" /></a> Three cards I got from one bank[/caption]

At 28.02.2013, I first transferred 5 Euro to check if everything works as expected. I have to transfer it to my girocard. It arrived at 01.03.2013. Then I have to transfer it to my Visa card. It arrived at 04.03.2013. Quite a long time for an internal transaction.

As I made three attempts to login into my online account from comdirect bank, my account was locked. I had to send a fax and ask them to unlock my account! Another Euro for the fax. (By the way, I think this is a security leak. If I wanted to do harm to the bank, I could make lots of accesses to their customers accounts and lock them. I guess it wouldn't take me more than 30 minutes to write the code and about one day to let it run. Very bad.)

<h3>Google Play</h3>
Ok, I've got a credit card. Now I will have bought a Nexus 4 in a couple of minutes, right? Wrong.

What the hell? They think I live in Helgoland or have military address?

Ok, let's try it again:

[gallery size="medium" columns="2" ids="59931,59871"]

WTF? Although the transaction was canceled, my bank thinks it happened. I can't see the transaction in my bank account, though. According to my online bank account, I haven't reached my limit. But I cannot pay for the "second" phone. That sucks.

The next day it worked:

2013-03-07: Now I have to wait for the phone.

2013-03-08: Hurray, it's here!

My old not-so-smart phone and my new Nexus 4:

<h2>Micro-SIM vs. Mini-SIM</h2>
Did you know that different SIM cards exist? I didn't. I've learned that I have a Mini-SIM, but you need a Micro-SIM for the Nexus 4. 

[caption id="attachment_60011" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gsm-sim-card-evolution.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gsm-sim-card-evolution-300x93.png" alt="GSM SIM card evolution" width="300" height="93" class="size-medium wp-image-60011" /></a> GSM SIM card evolution (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GSM_SIM_card_evolution.svg">source</a>)[/caption]

I use a pre-paid card from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simyo">simyo</a>. Currently, they offer a free exchange of Mini-SIM-cards to Micro-SIM or Nano-SIM:

[caption id="attachment_60021" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/simyo-2013-03-08-1912.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/simyo-2013-03-08-1912-300x217.png" alt="Simyo: Free Micro-SIM" width="300" height="217" class="size-medium wp-image-60021" /></a> Simyo: Free Micro-SIM[/caption]

Phew! I was lucky.

The Micro-SIM-card arrived at 2013-03-14 and will be unlocked the next day.

<h2>Experiments with Nexus 4</h2>
<h3>Photo-Sphere</h3>
You can create <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/check-out-these-awesome-photo-sphere">awesome photos</a> with photo sphere. But objects have to be not very close.

Here is my first try with my room:

[caption id="attachment_60051" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/my-room-2013-03-08.jpg"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/my-room-2013-03-08-300x150.jpg" alt="A sphere photo of my room" width="300" height="150" class="size-medium wp-image-60051" /></a> A sphere photo of my room[/caption]

[sphere 60431]

At the moment, it is not simply possible to include a sphere into a WordPress blog. <a href="https://github.com/kennydude/photosphere">Code</a> was published to create this effect and <a href="http://kennydude.github.com/photosphere/test.html">it works</a>, but <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-photo-sphere/">the WordPress plugin</a> has <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-photo-sphere">some issues</a>.

By the way, you can directly create a tiny world image from a photo sphere:

<h3>Adding a nicer alarm</h3>
One reason why I bought this phone was that my alarm clock (which is my old phone) is awful. <a href="http://www.zedge.net/ringtones/6067/google-nexus-4-ringtones/0-6-1/">zedge.net</a> seems to be one place where you can get ring tones. I like <a href="http://goo.gl/8c36v">Sintels song</a>, which was in Google Music.

I've installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.angryredplanet.android.rings_extended">Rings Extended</a>, as I wasn't able to find the ringtone without it. That could be better.

<h3>Sky Map</h3>
As my phone as quite a lot of sensors (GPS, compass, altimeter) I guessed it might be possible to store the well-known stars and show them on the device when you look in their direction. The app is calles "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&hl=en">Sky Map</a>". I have to try that when the sky is clear.

[caption id="attachment_60261" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/android-sky-map.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/android-sky-map-300x180.png" alt="Android Sky Map" width="300" height="180" class="size-medium wp-image-60261" /></a> Android Sky Map[/caption]

<h3>Movies</h3>
I was very surprised that they don't have <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/blender-open-movies/">Blender Open Movies</a> in the movie section of play store :-(

<h3>MyTracks</h3>
MyTracks lets you record the track you take and see some stats about that. Quite nice, but the export doesn't work.

I filed my first bug / feature request for an app: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mytracks/issues/detail?id=1260">Issue 1260</a>

<h2>What it replaces</h2>

Nexus 4 could replace quite a lot of stuff:
[caption id="attachment_60531" align="aligncenter" width="295"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/what-nexus-4-could-replace.jpg"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/what-nexus-4-could-replace-295x300.jpg" alt="What Nexus 4 could replace" width="295" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-60531" /></a> What Nexus 4 could replace[/caption]

But it can't replace credit cards in Germany as NFC isn't supported by the shops by now. It can't really replace a camera as the quality is ugly. Just take a close look at the photo above. This was taken with Nexus 4. Sadly, if you don't install apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid">AirDroid</a>, it can't replace a USB stick or a MP3 player. Yes, you can use Google Music and that works, but I would like to be able to copy MP3s from my laptop computer to my smartphone. Directly. With a USB-cable and without having to use the internet.
It does replace a notepad, if you only use it for writing texts and not for drawing or math.
And, finally, at the moment it doesn't even replace my old phone because of the SIM-problem I've explained above.
But as soon as this is fixed, the Nexus 4 will replace my Motorola W156.

Here is a comparision of those phones:
<table>
 <thead>
  <th>&nbsp;</th>
  <th>Nexus 4</th>
  <th>Motorola W156</th>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>Display</td>
  <td>4.7 in (120 mm) diagonal IPS<br/>1280&times;768 px (316 ppi)</td>
  <td>1.6 in (40 mm) diagonal<br/>128&times;128 pixel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Colors</td>
  <td>16 777 216</td>
  <td>2</td>

  <tr>
  <td>Memory</td>
  <td>16 GB</td>
  <td>20 kb (<a href="http://motorolafans.cz/en/phones/motorola-w156.php">source</a>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Body</td>
  <td>133.9 x 68.7 x 9.1 mm</td>
  <td>114 x 43 x 14 mm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Weight</td>
  <td>139 g</td>
  <td>85 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Stand-by time</td>
  <td>390 hours</td>
  <td>465 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Battery</td>
  <td>2100 mAh (Li - Polymer)</td>
  <td>940 mAh (Li - Ion)</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

Here is the <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/phones/compare/Motorola-W156,Google-Nexus-4/phones/2435,7531">source</a> for that comparison.

What it hopefully really replaces are maps. I've just downloaded maps for the center of Paris. That were only about 2 MB. Here is a screenshot of maps guidance in action:

[caption id="attachment_60561" align="aligncenter" width="180"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/google-maps-on-nexus-4-in-action.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/google-maps-on-nexus-4-in-action-180x300.png" alt="Google Maps on Nexus 4 in action" width="180" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-60561" /></a> Google Maps on Nexus 4 in action[/caption]

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I finally paid 358,99 Euro for the phone and shipping, 8 Euro for the "Meldebest&auml;tigung" and 1 Euro for the fax to re-activate my bank account which is 367,99 Euro in total. But if you want to experiment with a high quality smart phone, I guess it's a good choice.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
I have some ideas for apps. So my next steps are:

<ol>
  <li>Kick Windows 7 and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_Guide">install Arch Linux</a> as the implementation / QA for PSE is over</li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">Start developing apps</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/publish/register.html">Get Started with Publishing</a></li>
</ol>

I guess I'll also write an article what could get improved in Android.
