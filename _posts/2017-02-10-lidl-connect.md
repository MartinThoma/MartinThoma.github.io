Finding good solutions to have a phone number and decent internet when being in
another country is a annoying task. For this reason, I wrote the following
article: To help students who come to Germany.


## General overview

In Germany, pre-paid sim cards are pretty good compared to contracts. Well-known
providers of pre-paid cards are:

* Discounters
    * [Aldi Talk](https://www.alditalk.de/)
    * [Lidl Connect](https://www.lidl.de/de/lidl-connect/s7373597)
* Online
    * [blau.de](https://www.blau.de/) (former "simyo")
    * [simquardat.de](https://www.simquadrat.de/)


## How to get Lidl Connect card

1. Go to a Lidl store. Near the check-out, there are small cardboard cards.
   When you paid for it, they will give you a similar small "box". This box
   contains the sim card (standard, micro and nano) as well as instructions
   (German only)
2. Go to [Lidl Connect](https://www.lidl.de/de/lidl-connect/s7373597) and
   register a new account with the card you just bought.
3. The card gets activated within 30 minutes.
4. You can login at [https://kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de/](kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de)


## Switching from Blau.de to Lidl

As Simyo recently was changed into blau.de, I am a customer of Blau.de.
However, the service is worse than the one of Lidl, so I switched.

After getting your Lidl Connect card, you have to tell Blau that you want to
keep the number (Rufnummernmitnahme). Fill out <a href="https://mein.blau.de/cms/blaude/documents/blau_Verzichtserklaerung.pdf?ext=1">this form</a> and send it to the address
on the form. Your "SIM-Kartennummer" is printed on the sim card itself.

I sent it on 23.12.2016 to them. I'm still (02.01.2016) waiting for a response.
