  content: ! "Hey Martin, \r\n\r\nI knew right away that you would love the idea.
    When I had the idea I was also amazed that no one else had thought of this before!
    It is really simple but maybe just a little bit to much outside the box. I also
    had to sit in this talk by Stefan Wilk, receive a video from furious pete http://twitter.com/#!/renepickhardt/status/129991092824322050
    and know that in legend was about to release some videos at the same time in order
    to see this connection :P\r\n\r\nhope your classes are not too boring for you!\r\n\r\ngreetz

Today a friend of mine <a href="http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/first-youtube-dvd-online-for-ballads-n-bullets-by-in-legend/">posted</a> an article about a very neat idea. He created a DVD-like menu with several YouTube clips.

Just take a look:

This idea is beatiful: It is simple, but it didn't come to my mind before. I knew overlays and saw them sometimes, but I never saw them being used in such a nice way.

Great work, Ren&eacute;!
