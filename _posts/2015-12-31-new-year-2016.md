It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2015

The last year has had it ups and downs. Most of them are private, so I'll not
write too much about it. However, I would like to share two of them with you:
I've been on my first summer school of the German National Academic Foundation
(Sommerakademie der Studienstiftung, see [photos](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_Martin_Thoma/Sommerakademie-2015)) and I've been for two weeks hiking the west highland way
(see [photos](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_Martin_Thoma/WHW)).
This month was really awesome.

Here are some other mentionable facts:

* I've founded **Machine Learning Karlsruhe**. See [ml-ka.de](http://ml-ka.de)
  for more information.
* I've got 10&thinsp;000&nbsp;points on StackOverflow and reached 2.5 million people with
  my questions and answers ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/moose))
* I've got the funding by the [Begabtenstiftung](http://www.begabtenstiftung-informatik.de/)
  to go with my friend Marvin to Berkeley. Let's see if Berkeley accepts us.
* I've published 4&nbsp;papers on arXiv
  ([link](http://arxiv.org/a/thoma_m_1.html)) (one is still on hold) and
  started building an academic profile with
  [orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690). I'm
  not sure how important that will be, though.
* I posted 36&nbsp;articles on my blog in&nbsp;2015. However, I don't think there is
  a single good article amongst them. I simply didn't have enough time to write
  an interesting article ☹. There are 47&nbsp;drafts from 2015; 134&nbsp;drafts
  in total.
* [write-math.com](http://write-math.com/) now has
    * 2520&nbsp;users who contributed something
    * 1595&nbsp;formulas (that includes simple symbols)
    * 274244&nbsp;recordings. 6495 of those are not classified yet.


## Finishing Things

I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially
cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash.

### E-Mail

Finding and deleting old unnecessary emails:

* StackExchange: do-not-reply@stackexchange.com
* University
  * physik-l@lists.kit.edu
  * physik-ll@lists.kit.edu
  * stipendiaten@lists.does-not-exist.org
  * ilias@scc-ilias-03.scc.kit.edu
* Programming
  * notifications@travis-ci.org
  * noreply@coursera.org
* Other
  * notify@twitter.com
  * jobs-listings@linkedin.com
  * messages-noreply@linkedin.com
  * noreply@indiegogo.com
  * mailing@abgeordnetenwatch.de
  * offener-haushalt-request@lists.okfn.org
  * infoen@bondora.com

This were several hundret emails.

The next step is going through "marked emails".


### Desktop and Downloads

Clean those folders up ... \*sigh\*... I didn't get ready.


### Updating

```bash
# apt-get update
# apt-get upgrade
$ upgrade_oh_my_zsh
```

## Plans

I want to get the following things done in 2016:

* [x] Quit church: That one is actually more complicated in Germany than it
  should be. I have to get to the civil registry office, get a **personal**
  date, **pay 31.50 Euro**
  (Source: [karlsruhe.de](https://web1.karlsruhe.de/service/d115/detail.php?prod_id=463))
* [x] Migrate from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) (see [article draft](https://github.com/MartinThoma/MartinThoma.github.io/blob/source/_drafts/2015-11-13-migrate-from-jekyll-to-pelican.md))
* [ ] Get all my stuff from my fathers apartment to my room. I've already
      packed most of it in boxes (In total: 1.30m (+0.30m?) × 0.39m × 0.60m by 7 boxes)
* [x] Get rid of my old bed
* [x] Get rid of my old vacuum cleaner
* [x] Paint the wall
* [x] Contact BSI, BKA, CCC and the car sellers and send them my paper in which
      I summarize current problems in car security.
* [ ] Getting new slippers

Of course, I have a lot of other plans. Although some people say I don't do
anything besides computer stuff, I do have a prive life. But in contrast to
others I like to keep it private.

I wish all of you a happy new year!


## Predictions for 2016

I've just seen [Predictions for 2016](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/01/predictions-of-new-year.html)
on Computational Complexity and thought it is a fun idea. It is currently the
4th of January, so the year is still young enough to not consider this
cheating:


Machine Learning and Technology

1. Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8&nbsp;layers is usual; I expect
   this to get to over 30&nbsp;layers.
2. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning
   is used will appear.
3. Machines will generate "high" resolution images of at least 256 &times; 256
   pixels.
4. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the
   original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in
   Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy. See [Towel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day), [Google Translate Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-google.ogg), [Festival Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-festival.ogg)
5. ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to
   about 900&nbsp;Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690&nbsp;Euro).
6. [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/) will make some tiny
   advances.

About Me

7. One of my papers will get cited at least 5&nbsp;times.
8. I will spend at least 2&nbsp;weeks abroad.
9. I will publish at leat 40&nbsp;articles on my blog.
10. I will get a 90&nbsp;days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is
   43&nbsp;days).
11. I will get 15&thinsp;000 points on StackExchange (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/martin-thoma?tab=accounts))

Politics

12. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
    still exist and Britain will still be part of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).
13. Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the
    democrat candidate.
14. The republican candidate will get president.
15. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will
    happen.
16. Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see [Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtagswahl_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_2016)).
