3D printing is a hot topic for quite a while now. 3D printers have become cheap
enough so that many ordinary people can have 3D printers for their personal
use. In this article, I would like to point out some very nice applications
of 3D printing.

## Medicine
3D printing has basically two application in medicine: Very customized
non-organic parts or organic printing.

### Printing a human Kidney

### Other examples

* [Hearing aids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid)
* Bones
* Print on wounds

## Shoes

I am always struggling with finding good shoes. Most shoes I try feel
unconfortable, although I have size 42 (which seems to be a very standard
size in Germany for males). What if we could go to a store, let them 3D scan
our feet and they automatically adjust a 3D model of a shoe to fit to our
feet. Then some parts are 3D printed, assembled and a few days later we get
a shoe that is customized to our feet and cheap.

[continuumfashion.com](http://www.continuumfashion.com/) seems to 3D print
shoes with Nylon. [kobilevidesign.com](http://kobilevidesign.com/) is another
designer who 3D prints shoes.

## Toys

* Board game figures (e.g. custom chess sets, Monopoly cars, ...)
* Model building (e.g. [Ship model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_model) where people pay A LOT of money for it)
* Lego

## Teaching

Did you have chemistry in school and learn about atom models / crystaline
structures? With 3D printing, it becomes easy to get those models for every
student!

Or think about architecture and history. You could show models of ancient
cities or buildings in 3D.

## Spare parts

Imagine something small breaks. Sometimes very expensive devices that are
otherwise fine, become useless or at least ugly. Now think you could go online,
download a 3D model of that part and just print it.

## Design

* Lamps
* Cups


## Weapons

Sadly, 3D printing can also be used to produce weapons
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun))).

However, a 3D printed pistol has a high chance of not working at all, of
hurting the person that created it and of working. So currently, it's quite a
lot of gambling. But that might change when the quality of 3D printing improves.
