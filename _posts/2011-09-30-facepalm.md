With the Internet came a lot of new words. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberculture">Cyberculture</a> could be one of them, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)">Googling</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism">Hacktivism</a> would be others.

Did you know that the famous gesture of Piccard is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facepalm">Facepalm</a>?

The same word seems to exist also in German, so I'm quite sure that the word is new. (Although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duden">Duden</a> doesn't know it.)

Although the gesture itself is obviously old:
