It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2016

This year was pretty awesome. I went to a summer school in Greifswald where
I got to know a lot of nice people. I participated in a wind surfing and in
a sailing curse. I hiked the [GR 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_20),
finished my first via ferrata ([Alpspitz-Ferrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpspitze)),
went to the [Salewa-Kletersteig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iseler) and
the TODO Klettersteig near Füssen.

In July, I got to know [Bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) and managed to finish the first Fb 6c - 7b routes. However, only routes up to 5c are always
easy for me (see [table with climbing grades](http://www.klettern.de/besser-klettern/schwierigkeitsgrade/vergleichstabelle-schwierigkeitsgrade-beim-klettern.159298.5.htm) and [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing))).

Here are some other mentionable facts:

* [ML-KA](https://ml-ka.de/) is still active.
* I have 15&thinsp;838 points on StackOverflow and reached 5.1&nbsp;million people
  with my posts ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/martin-thoma)).
* I wrote 53&nbsp;articles for this blog (including this one) in 2016. A couple
  of them might be interesting for a very specific audience ([SVMs](https://martin-thoma.com/svm-with-sklearn/), [classifier comparison](https://martin-thoma.com/comparing-classifiers/),
  [machine learning glossary](https://martin-thoma.com/ml-glossary/)).



### Old year resolutions

* 05.02.2016: Sold my old vacuum cleaner
* 17.02.2016: Quit church
* 08.05.2016: Migrate Blog to Pelican
* 14.04.2016: Contact BSI, BKA, CCC and the car sellers and send them
  [my paper](https://zenodo.org/record/50379) in which I summarize current
  problems in car security. (Later, I found [this](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article154677618/BSI-Chef-warnt-vor-Toten-durch-Hackerangriffe-auf-Autos.html). Coincidence?)
* 01.11.2016: I got rid of my old bed
* 03.11.2016: I painted some walls in my appartment (not all, though)

## Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. *Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8&nbsp;layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30&nbsp;layers.*<br/>
   [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) has networks with over 1000 layers.
2. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear.<br/>
   [Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist), [/r/howhot](https://www.reddit.com/r/howhot)
3. Machines will generate "high" resolution images of at least 256 &times; 256
   pixels.
4. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the
   original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in
   Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy. See [Towel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day), [Google Translate Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-google.ogg), [Festival Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-festival.ogg)
5. ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to
   about 900&nbsp;Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690&nbsp;Euro).
6. [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/) will make some tiny
   advances.

About Me

7. One of my papers will get cited at least 5&nbsp;times.
8. I will spend at least 2&nbsp;weeks abroad.<br/>
   <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Done</span>: My trip to Corsica was a bit longer than 2&nbsp;weeks.
9. I will publish at leat 40&nbsp;articles on my blog.
10. I will get a 90&nbsp;days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is
   43&nbsp;days).<br/>
   <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Failed</span>
11. I will get 15&thinsp;000 points on StackExchange (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/martin-thoma?tab=accounts))

Politics

12. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
    still exist and Britain will still be part of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).<br/>
    <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Correct</span> (Yes, they voted for Brexit. But currently they are still part of the EU. And I doubt they will really quit the EU.)
13. Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the
    democrat candidate.<br/>
    I was right about this.
14. The republican candidate will get president.
15. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will
    happen.
16. Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see [Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtagswahl_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_2016)).

## Finishing things

I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially
cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash.

### E-Mail

Finding and deleting old unnecessary emails:

* StackExchange: do-not-reply@stackexchange.com
* University
    * stipendiaten@lists.does-not-exist.org
    * ilias@scc-ilias-03.scc.kit.edu
* Programming
    * notifications@travis-ci.org
    * noreply@coursera.org
* Other
    * notify@twitter.com

    * noreply@indiegogo.com

This were several hundret emails.
