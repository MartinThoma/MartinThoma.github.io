It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2016



### Old year resolutions

* 05.02.2016: Sold my old vacuum cleaner
* 17.02.2016: Quit church
* 08.05.2016: Migrate Blog to Pelican
* 14.04.2016: Contact BSI, BKA, CCC and the car sellers and send them
  [my paper](https://zenodo.org/record/50379) in which I summarize current
  problems in car security. (Later, I found [this](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article154677618/BSI-Chef-warnt-vor-Toten-durch-Hackerangriffe-auf-Autos.html). Coincidence?)
* 01.11.2016: I got rid of my old bed
* 03.11.2016: I painted some walls in my appartment (not all, though)

## Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. *Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8&nbsp;layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30&nbsp;layers.*<br/>
   [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) has networks with over 1000 layers.
2. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear.<br/>
   [Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist), [/r/howhot](https://www.reddit.com/r/howhot)
3. Machines will generate "high" resolution images of at least 256 &times; 256
   pixels.
4. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the
   original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in
   Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy. See [Towel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day), [Google Translate Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-google.ogg), [Festival Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-festival.ogg)
5. ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to
   about 900&nbsp;Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690&nbsp;Euro).
6. [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/) will make some tiny
   advances.

About Me

7. One of my papers will get cited at least 5&nbsp;times.
8. I will spend at least 2&nbsp;weeks abroad.<br/>
   <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Done</span>: My trip to Corsica was a bit longer than 2&nbsp;weeks.
9. I will publish at leat 40&nbsp;articles on my blog.
10. I will get a 90&nbsp;days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is
   43&nbsp;days).<br/>
   <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Failed</span>
11. I will get 15&thinsp;000 points on StackExchange (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/martin-thoma?tab=accounts))

Politics

12. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
    still exist and Britain will still be part of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).<br/>
    <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Correct</span> (Yes, they voted for Brexit. But currently they are still part of the EU. And I doubt they will really quit the EU.)
13. Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the
    democrat candidate.<br/>
    I was right about this.
14. The republican candidate will get president.
15. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will
    happen.
16. Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see [Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtagswahl_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_2016)).
