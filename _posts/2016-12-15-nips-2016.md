The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is
probably the biggest conference with machine learning / deep learning as a
main topic. This year, about 6000 people attended it. My friend Marvin and me
were supported by [Begabtenstiftung Informatik Karlsruhe](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/begabtenstiftung_informatik_karlsruhe.php).

## GANs

Generative Adverserial Networks (short: GANs) were one hot topic at NIPS. The idea is to train two networks: A generator G and a discriminator D. The generator creates content (e.g. images) and the discriminator has to decide if the content is of the natural distribution (the training set) or made by the generator. The loss of the discriminator is 

$$TODO$$

and the loss of the generator is

$$TODO$$
