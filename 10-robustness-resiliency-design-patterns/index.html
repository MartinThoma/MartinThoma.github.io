            <p>Software is correct if it acts as specified. It is robust if it can take a
high load until it goes down. Software is resilient if it can go back to
normal after a disruption. The disruption could be a power outage, a temporary
network outage, a full disk, or a web service that is temporarily not
reachable. There are patterns to deal with those issues. Learn them, use them!</p>
<h2 id="1-fallback">1. Fallback</h2>
<p>You probably know it: You&rsquo;re commuting, reading your favorite articles on your
smartphone when the connection drops. You enter your favorite blog URL &mdash;
martin-thoma.com, I hope &mdash; but you only get to know that you lost the internet
connection:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter img-thumbnail">
<a href="../images/2021/05/fallback-chrome.png"><img alt="Fallback option for Chrome" src="../images/2018/05/fallback-chrome.png" style="width: 512px;"/></a>
<figcaption class="text-center">Fallback option for Chrome</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Your browser cannot get any information from the internet without a
connection. Obviously. But what could it do instead?</p>
<p>Google Chrome shows you a mini-game. It tries to inform you what you could
possibly do to fix it and you can choose to play with the dinosaur. The
dinosaur game is not what you wanted, but a neat fallback.</p>
<p>In other contexts, fallbacks are called a &ldquo;fail-safe&rdquo;. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch">dead man&rsquo;s
switch</a> in trains is one
concrete example. The train driver has to press a pedal in regular intervals
to show that he is ok and paying attention. If the train driver does not press
the dead man&rsquo;s switch, the train performs an emergency stop.</p>
<h2 id="2-retry">2. Retry</h2>
<p>While you&rsquo;re playing the mini-game, the browser can still try to get the
website. Maybe your connection is unstable. This means you have a connection
once in a while. The browser can try to get what you need in the background
and support you with offline reading when you want to go back. Not ideal, but
a good fallback. Better than the mini-game.</p>
<p>To get to this improved fallback, the browser has to retry to get to the website.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter img-thumbnail">
<a href="../images/2021/05/error-loading-data-server.png"><img alt="Image by Revansx from Wikimedia Commons" src="../images/2021/05/error-loading-data-server.png" style="width: 512px;"/></a>

<p>Yes, that is a pattern. A trivial one, but an important one. I&lsquo;ve used it when
sending web requests. If you receive an error, try again. The Python requests
library has a built-in
<a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/?highlight=max_retries#requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter">max_retries</a>
argument for some of the error cases.</p>
<p>In some cases, you deal with changing state. Now it becomes tricky. Maybe you
don&rsquo;t really know if the request before failed? Can you risk executing the
request twice? The property you want is <strong>idempotency</strong>: f(x) = f(f(x)).
Applying the function twice yields the same result as applying it once.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a money transfer like &ldquo;Martin sends 50 EUR to Anna&rdquo;,
it&rsquo;s not idempotent. If you have &ldquo;Execute transaction XYZ, if not executed
before&rdquo;, it is. However, now you need to make sure that you have a locking
mechanism and that all transactions have unique IDs.</p>
<p>Retrying to connect to a failing service comes with its own problems. You
might make it harder for the service to get back to normal. For this reason,
you might want to consider <strong>capped exponential backoff</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">max_sleep</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">300</span>  <span class="c1"># seconds</span>
<span class="n">base_sleep</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>  <span class="c1"># seconds</span>
<span class="n">sleep_time</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_sleep</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">base</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">attempts</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to prevent multiple services essentially hitting at the same time,
you can add a jitter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">max_sleep</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">300</span>  <span class="c1"># seconds</span>
<span class="n">base_sleep</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>  <span class="c1"># seconds</span>
<span class="n">jitter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># seconds</span>

<span class="n">sleep_time</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_sleep</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">base</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">attempts</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">jitter</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="3-timeout-and-other-resource-limitations">3. Timeout and other Resource Limitations</h2>
<p>At some point, you need to accept that something is broken. But when do you do
that? A common default is to wait for a response from a web service for 30
seconds. That is really long. In many cases, you want a timeout way sooner.
The timeout basically means that you accept that something went wrong. After
the timeout, you can retry or use a fallback.</p>
<p>Limiting the possible execution time for one function, process, or program is
also of advantage in other situations. The Google Code Jam pops into my mind.
It&rsquo;s an open competition in which developers submit code to tasks given by
Google. Those solutions might have flaws that lead to infinite loops. This
means if Google executes those solutions, they need to limit the potential
execution time.</p>
<p>A watchdog can monitor the responsiveness of the overall system and restart
everything in case the system becomes unresponsive. Web services, for example,
typically have a /health endpoint that responds with something trivial, e.g.
the constant string "healthy" or the current system time. If the response does
not come or takes too long, the system is marked as &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s
unhealthy for too long, the Docker container is restarted.</p>
<p>Another resource you might want to limit is memory and disk. Think about
anti-virus software that wants to check a ZIP archive. The archive might be a
ZIP bomb:
<a href="https://infosecwriteups.com/zip-bombs-30337a1b0112"><strong>ZIP Bombs 💣😈</strong>
<em>Make your storage explode 💥</em>infosecwriteups.com</a></p>
<p>By limiting both resources you make sure you&rsquo;re not vulnerable to this issue.</p>
<h2 id="4-circuit-breaker">4. Circuit Breaker</h2>
<p><img alt="Photo of a two-pole circuit breaker on Wikimedia Commons by Dmitry G" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*QJlGl6Oslr7t1xeh.JPG"/><em>Photo of a two-pole circuit breaker on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TDM_2-pole_circuit_breaker_16A.JPG">Wikimedia Commons</a> by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dmitry_G">Dmitry G</a></em></p>
<p>If something is wrong with the electricity in one room of your house, e.g. one
part is having a short-circuit or consuming too much power, you want
everything else to still work.</p>
<p>In the case of software, you might think of a web service A which uses a web
service B. Now A notices that B starts getting slower and slower. Now A could
just send all requests to B and handle the potential timeouts. However, it can
also notice that B is having issues. A stops sending normal requests to B,
giving B time to recover. This means there needs to be a mechanism to check if
B is healthy again. That could be just a health-endpoint. Or it could be a
throttled mode at A where response times are automatically measured.</p>
<p>The circuit-breaker pattern goes slightly beyond the capped exponential
backoff with jitter. It tracks requests over multiple sources.</p>
<h2 id="5-rate-limiting">5. Rate Limiting</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about the retry pattern with capped exponential backoff and
circuit breaker pattern as ways to be &ldquo;good neighbors&rdquo;, trying to protect the
services they use.</p>
<p>However, not every user is such a good neighbor. They might not intentionally
try to harm you, but maybe a developer is not aware that they are using an
endpoint which causes a lot of work. You might want to be able to limit how
the API is used &mdash; especially if it&rsquo;s public.</p>
<h2 id="6-redundancy">6. Redundancy</h2>
<p>Servers can fail due to <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-and-seagate-use-ai-to-predict-hard-drive-failures/">breaking hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/texas-power-outages-bring-austin-city-data-center-offline/">power outages</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU">a fire in the data center</a>, or network outages due to construction work to name just a few reasons. Having redundancy makes the system more robust against those rare events.</p>
<p>For hard disks, we have various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels">RAID levels</a>. For APIs, we can start multiple instances and have a round-robin load balancing.</p>
<p><img alt="Image by Martin Thoma" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2646/1*46FG93CzACdXJiDQptl5CQ.png"/><em>Image by Martin Thoma</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say each server is 99.0% available. That means it is down for 3.65 days
each year. If you have a redundant system where servers run in parallel as
outlined above, the service is still up when at least one server is up. That
means the availability increases to 1-(1-p)^n where n is the number of servers
and p is the availability of one server. Let&rsquo;s see how those numbers change
with n:</p>
<ul>
<li>n=1: The service is 99.0% available. That&rsquo;s 3.65 days of downtime per year.</li>
<li>n=2: The service is 99.99% (&ldquo;four nines&rdquo;) available. That&rsquo;s 52 minutes of
  downtime per year.</li>
<li>n=3: The service is 99.9999% (&ldquo;six nines&rdquo;) available. That&rsquo;s 31 seconds of
  downtime per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes that a single server going down does not harm the others &mdash; which
is unlikely, as the load will increase.</p>
<p>You should also note that this is for services that run in parallel and can
replace each other. If you have services that rely on each other the formula
changes to <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>n=1: The service is 99.0% available. That&rsquo;s 3.65 days of downtime per year.</li>
<li>n=2: The service is 98.01% available. That&rsquo;s 7.27 days of downtime per year.</li>
<li>n=3: The service is 97.03% available. That&rsquo;s 10.8 days of downtime per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spinning up such parallel machines is easy if you don&rsquo;t need to store or
modify state. It&rsquo;s a lot harder for databases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mainly written about servers here, but you can also think of
<strong>error-correcting codes</strong> in the case of network communication and storage
also is the redundancy pattern.</p>
<h2 id="7-bulkhead">7. Bulkhead</h2>
<p>Bulkheads provide boundaries across which failures do not propagate. For
example, think of YouTube. Users can upload videos and the videos get
re-encoded. Executing this task on a separate machine guarantees that no
issues with disk space, memory usage, CPU usage, and potential exploits in the
used libraries affect the rest of the system. Having the software run of a
separate machine is one form of sandboxing. We can guarantee by this strong
isolation that this single feature will not affect others.</p>
<h2 id="8-caching">8. Caching</h2>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with caching. On the one hand, caches reduce
the load on your servers A LOT. They provide a nice fallback as well. On the
other hand, you need to deal with inconsistencies introduced by caching. Maybe
you need to explicitly invalidate the caches.</p>
<p><a href="undefined">Adrian Hornsby</a> wrote a nice article about caching for resilience:
<a href="https://medium.com/the-cloud-architect/patterns-for-resilient-architecture-part-4-85afa66d6341"><strong>Patterns for Resilient Architecture &mdash; Part 4</strong>
<em>Caching for Resiliency</em>medium.com</a></p>
<h2 id="9-boundary-validation">9. Boundary Validation</h2>
<p>You want to make sure that the input to your service is structured as expected
and that you provide the output you promised. You can use libraries like
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/">pydantic</a> to clearly define models of
what you expect as input. Checking parameters is important. If something is
not as expected, you should fail early. If an external API has changed its
response types, e.g. from float to string, you want to know this early. In the
best case, you can even convert it automatically. If you received a complex
dictionary and the service changed deep down how the response is structured,
having clear models helps a lot.</p>
<p>For external systems, you want to clearly separate the input model from the
rest. This should at least be its own module or class. If it&rsquo;s something
bigger, maybe even its own library or an internal service that wraps the
external service.</p>
<h2 id="10-rollbacks">10. Rollbacks</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the external world that makes our software fail. Programming
mistakes we developers introduce have their fair share as well. In fact, I
would argue that no non-trivial system is bug-free. Some bugs are acceptable,
others are not. And some bugs are so problematic, that they need to be fixed
ASAP.</p>
<p>This is where rollbacks come into play. A rollback means to jump back to a
stable system state. I know them from two fronts: Either from a version
control system like git where a previous release that is known to work is
restored. Or from a systems perspective, e.g. using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift">OpenShift Container
Platform</a>. Every service is running
in a Docker container. Updating a service means adding a new image and
changing the service:latest tag. If a service is never healthy, the last known
healthy image is used.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The presented design patterns can be grouped:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detection</strong>: Get to know that something is wrong. <code>Timeouts</code> and
  <code>Checksumsare</code> in this category.</li>
<li><strong>Containment</strong>: Make sure the errors don&rsquo;t affect other systems and limit
  the impact on the user. The patterns in this category are <code>Fallback</code>,
  <code>Resource Limitation</code>, <code>Circuit Breaker</code>, <code>Bulkhead</code>, <code>Caching</code></li>
<li><strong>Recovery</strong>: Get back up. Retry and Rollback are in this category</li>
<li><strong>Prevention</strong>: Avoid getting into trouble in the first place. <code>Rate
  Limiting</code>, <code>Redundancy</code>, <code>Caching</code>, and <code>Boundary Validation</code> do that.</li>
</ul>

    Create intra-page links
    Requires that your headings already have an `id` attribute set
    For every heading in your page, this adds a little anchor link `#` that you can click to get a permalink to the heading.
    Ignores `h1`, because you should only have one per page.
    The text content of the tag is used to generate the link, so it will fail "gracefully-ish" if you have duplicate heading text.
