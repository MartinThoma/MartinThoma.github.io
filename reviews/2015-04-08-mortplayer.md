I like the player.

* It plays, even if the screen is black.
* It stops when you remove the headphones (which comes in handy when you listen to it when you go to bed. Just pull the headphones out and it stops).
* It has options to stop after the current file / folder / all files
* The buttons are big


What I don't like (1.5 stars less) is that the audio sounds strange when you stop / continue often. Then, you can only make a restart.

I also don't like (0.5 stars less) that it is not too clear how to find the files / folders you want to play back.
