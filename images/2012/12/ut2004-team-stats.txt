Unreal Tournament 2004: Team Building Guide by Hammerlock770
Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: 2004-08-09

OK, this’ll be the first time I’m doing something like this, so bear with me
here. For those who like the solo mode in UT2004 (or have slow internet
connections :x)), building your team is essential to winning, especially on the
really high difficulty levels. But when you’re looking to spend some
hard-earned credits on a new player from another team, you don’t get to see
their stats. Generally, the most expensive competitors are the ones with the
highest skills, but the game can have a very different idea of what is “useful”
than you. Also, there are quite a few players who are on the back lines of some
teams who are paid far less than they’re really worth. Wasting a couple of
thousand credits on a throwaway can really put you in the hole. I really wished
I could find something online that could tell me what kind of player I was
paying for.

Since there is no other such archive on the web that I could find, I wrote it
down on my own. I made the guide very practical; copying and recording the
personal biographies of all of these characters was something I considered, but
it would have taken hours, and since many of the human faces/bios are recycled
two or three times, it seemed unnecessary. All of the relevant information
about each tournament contestant (there are 110) is written down here so you
can choose your challenges carefully. I also included team rosters in case
you’d like to see it organized that way instead of searching through the list.
An update somewhere along the way including character bios isn’t out of the
question, but for now I have a lot more of my free time going into the game
itself!

Notes: The team captains that are listed here can actually be hired for your
team. After completing the qualification rounds, all “Weak” team captains and
players can be hired as free agents by looking in the “Team Management” tab.
When you have advanced to the top of all four ladders, even the Godlike
captains and teams will be at your disposal!

The captains will still play with their own teams, however. For instance: If
Malcolm is on your team during a match against Thunder Crash, your “Malcolm”
will temporarily take up a different name while playing against himself. They
are never available for Bloodrites challenges, and you can only challenge each
team for three of their players, no more. Also, there are some people you will
meet in the tournament who cannot be hired to play for your team at all, most
of them are people you meet in the qualifying rounds. Some independent players
from the qualifiers, such as Perdition, will eventually end up being drafted
into other teams and can be acquired the same way as anybody else.

If any future patches unlock new characters, I will update this FAQ.

The stats and preferences that make up your winning team are entirely up to
you, there are lots of different ways to build a team, and lots of strengths
and weaknesses to consider. I’m just making this available as a service to the
gaming community. So just pick your favorites and go kick some ass!

Copyright info: I consider the numbers and facts contained in my guide to be
public information. However, if you’re going to use this for any kind of public
internet distribution, I’d appreciate it if you gave me credit for it, because
I DID spend a lot of time working on this thing. Better yet, just link to my
guide directly at www.gamefaqs.com I won’t yell at you if you don’t acknowledge
me, I don’t have the energy to fight for this. However, if you do use it and
claim it as your own work, I hope you feel very, very guilty about it.
