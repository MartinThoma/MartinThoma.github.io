<p>It&rsquo;s New Year's Eve; as always &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to remember what happened and think
about what might happen in the future.</p>
<h2 id="review-of-2023">Review of 2023</h2>
<p>2023 was another year in which the Russo-Ukrainian war dominated other
discussions. I also remember seeing the occasional weird news about Donald Trump
facing criminal charges and still having a big chance of winning the next US
election.</p>
<p>We discuss the federal budget in Germany: Germanys' debt break is written into
the constitution and prevents investing in the future. A dominating majority is
still behind it, but occasional voices in the news want to reform it &mdash; some even
want to get rid of it completely. While the US is heavily investing, politicians
in Germany (CDU/CSU and FDP) are discussing how to cut social expenditures.</p>
<h3 id="net-climate-neutrality-breakthroughs-in-energy-production-and-electrification">Net Climate Neutrality: Breakthroughs in Energy Production and Electrification</h3>
<p>Renewable energy combined with electrification enables countries like Germany to
become independent of other countries like Russia.</p>
<p>It seems to me that wind turbines will not change much. It&rsquo;s now mainly about
making them easy to install and reducing production costs.</p>
<p>Photovoltaics, on the other hand, still have a lot of Research and Development
leading to interesting new results. Combining different &ldquo;layers&rdquo; leads to higher
efficiencies. New materials lead to lower weight. Integration into normal
windows, reducing the weight and thus making them easier to install seem to be
the big changes.</p>
<p>Water and biomass are stagnant: In Germany, we have no meaningful remaining
possibilities to install more water turbines or build more damns. Also, biomass
will not bring big changes in the overall picture as it cannot scale
sustainably.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Off-shore Wind</strong>: The Vestas V236 wind turbine produced 363 MWh in a single
  day (source). That is 74,081x what my 2-person household uses! So in that day,
  this single wind turbine could power a medium-sized city. Remarkable. A
  similar number was achieved in Germany (source). China can install such an
  off-shore turbine in less than 24 hours (source).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On-shore Wind</strong>: Plans for building a 380-meter-high on-shore wind turbine
  are discussed in Germany (source). The hub height would be 300 meters, the
  rotors would have a length of 80 meters. The higher, the more energy can be
  generated and the more reliable the wind becomes. Just for comparison: The
  Eiffel Tower is 330 meters high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Photovoltaics</strong>: Organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 15.8%
  (source), 26.7% is the mono-crystalline lab record, high concentration
  multi-junction solar cells achieve an efficiency of up to 47.1% today in the
  lab (source). Perovskite-silicon &ldquo;tandem&rdquo; cells reach 28.9% (source).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Battery technology is a key ingredient for the green energy transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Installed Capacity</strong>: A new 275 MWh large-scale
  battery storage facility will be built in Alfeld (Germany) by Kyon Energy
  (source). That is enough to power 56,122 households with my daily Energy
  consumption. The world record was set in 2020 in Moss Landing (USA) with 1600
  MWh. See List of energy storage power plants for more. It&rsquo;s estimated that
  897,000 battery storage units are installed in Germany in 2023 (source). Only
  15% of the battery storage capacity of Germany is in central facilities
  (source).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technological breakthroughs</strong>: Toyota claims it can build a
  solid-state battery until 2027 with a range of 1,200km (745 miles) that could
  charge in 10 minutes or less (source, source).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current state</strong>: Smartphones currently have 500mAh (at 3.6V,
  so 18Wh). The &Scaron;koda Enyaq and Tesla Model 3 have a battery capacity of 55&ndash;82
  kWh. House battery storage seems to go from 2.5 kWh to 180 kWh (source).
  Lithium-ion is by far the most popular type of battery, but please be reminded
  that this is a huge group of battery chemistries as the anode/cathode
  materials can be changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Electrification is a crucial step in the energy transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobility</strong>: Electric vehicles are becoming more popular, but
  still only 2.2% of all vehicles in Germany are battery-electric (source).
  About 2300 busses are electric in 2023 (source), but Germany has about 75.5k
  busses (source). Hence only 3% are electric so far. The German government
  wants to increase that to 50% by 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heating</strong>: In 2021, 2.6% of households were
  heating directly with electricity (infrared heaters or convection heaters) and
  2.8% indirectly with heat pumps; 14.1% are heating with district heating
  (source). Hence we have 19.5% heating with electricity or at least something
  that can be upgraded easily to climate change alternatives. Germany needs to
  get from those 19.5% to about 95% until 2045 (German Law: Klimaschutzgesetz).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate offsets</strong>: Some processes cannot be
  electrified, e.g. traveling by plane or producing cement. Avoiding those is
  one option and removing CO2 from the air is another one to compensate. Carbon
  capture and storage and planting trees are two options. Both are extremely
  expensive. Removing 1000kg CO2 from the air costs about 600&euro; (source). A
  single flight from Germany to New York City and back is about 3650kg CO2 per
  passenger (source). If you simply wanted to set the CO2 emissions off, you
  would need to pay an additional 2190&euro; per passenger for that flight. Hence it
  would not cost 400&euro; per person but 2600&euro; per person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hydrogen, by the way, is mostly a red herring in this topic. It&rsquo;s a
distraction. The clean hydrogen ladder shows pretty well where we have to use
it. The same goes for synthetic fuels (e-fuels).</p>

<h3 id="walking-and-cycling">Walking and Cycling</h3>
<p>I have doubts in the following statistics. As I buy groceries always by bike, I
don't believe I was cycling only 8km in May 2025. One trip to the supermarket is
4.5km already. I typically go once per week to the supermarket.</p>

<h2 id="old-year-predictions_1">Old Year Predictions</h2>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture-politics-nature-and-the-world">The Bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World</h3>
<ol>
<li>❌ Bavarian state elections: I was about right with the conservatives and the
   Green Party, but the social democratic party (SPD) was way weaker and the
   right-wing AfD was much stronger.</li>
<li>✅ Greece and Turkey: No update on their conflict.</li>
<li>✅Price increases and shortages continued. COVID is not a big topic anymore,
   but China now has other infection issues (as people were not exposed due to
   the strict measures).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<ol>
<li>✅ Medicine: mRNA-based vaccination did give another great piece of news &mdash;
   vaccination against cancer! (source)</li>
<li>✅ AI can use tools: You can now upload documents to ChatGPT, and connect
   ChatGPT to WolframAlpha and many other services.</li>
<li>🤷&zwj;&male;️ Battery and Solar: I was expecting gradual improvements, but I&rsquo;m
   uncertain how to verify that.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<ol>
<li>✅ Blogging: I&lsquo;ve&rsquo; published 30 articles. The 3 that took the most time to
   write were The Python PDF Ecosystem in 2023, Whats&rsquo; Hot and what not in
   Python, August 2023, GPT-4: Playing with Word Arithmetic.</li>
<li>❌ Side hustle: I didn&rsquo;t create a side hustle. I did write a service that was
   live for a month, but I didn&rsquo;t see a chance of it becoming profitable.</li>
<li>✅ Home: I bought a house 🎉</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="new-year-predictions_1">New Year Predictions</h2>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture-politics-nature-and-the-world_1">The Bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World</h3>
<ol>
<li>The right-wing party AfD gets stronger in Germany: There is the EU election
   and 13 regional elections in Germany in 2023. I expect AfD, a right-wing
   party, to become way stronger in those overall.</li>
<li>Ukraine: Still no peace. Putin just said that Russia will never move back
   (source). I think that the support of the west will continue to be strong
   enough that the area is in war, but not strong enough to push Russia away.</li>
<li>Renewables and electrification: A massive boost in installed renewable
   energy and a steady increase in electrification in transport and heating.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="technology_1">Technology</h3>
<p>LLMs will become better: I don&rsquo;t think that ChatGPT /
GPT4 is the end of it. I expect Amazon / Microsoft / Google to release new
software that makes use of similar stuff. We do have Google Bard already which
feels worse than ChatGPT. Bing Image Creator is pretty awesome, but the
ChatGPT-Like addendum to bing feels &hellip; ok. Not as exciting as ChatGPT. Amazon Q
is in preview, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it so far and I haven&rsquo;t seen any reviews.</p>
<ol>
<li>We will see a first game with free-form chat interactions with NPCs.</li>
<li>Solid-State Batteries will still not be a mass-produced thing.</li>
<li>Nuclear Fusion: It is unclear if nuclear fusion will be economically viable.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="about-me_1">About Me</h3>
<ol>
<li>Side Hustle: I&rsquo;ll finally start one. If I don&rsquo;t have any better ideas, I&rsquo;ll
   just continue with the PDF text extraction part.</li>
<li>Blogging: I&lsquo;ve published 30 articles. I hope I can finish my security series 😃</li>
<li>Fitness: I will walk and cycle more in each month of 2024 than in the same
    months of 2023.</li>

    Create intra-page links
    Requires that your headings already have an `id` attribute set
    For every heading in your page, this adds a little anchor link `#` that you can click to get a permalink to the heading.
    Ignores `h1`, because you should only have one per page.
    The text content of the tag is used to generate the link, so it will fail "gracefully-ish" if you have duplicate heading text.
