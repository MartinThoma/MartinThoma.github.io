In this article, I will explain what a string is, what Unicode, UTF-8, ASCII and encodings are and what their relationship is. Just when I was about to finish this, I found Joel Spolskys article . It is better to read, but a lot longer than what I wrote here. Datatype basics Datatypes are not a hardware feature. The CPU knows a couple (well, a lot) of different commands. Those are called the instruction set of a CPU. One of the best known ones is the x86 instruction set . If you search for \"multiply\" on this page, you get 50 results. MULPD and MULSD for the multiplication of doubles, FIMUL for integer multiplication, ... Those commands work on registers. Registers are memory slots which can contain 32 bit or 64 bit, depending on which architecture your CPU uses. Hence the CPU instruction interprets the values of the registers in a different way, but the values themselves don't have types. In compiled languages like C and C++, the compiler takes care of the type and creates a sequence of instructions which interpret the registers content as desired. In Python, the interpreter takes care of it. Simple Strings: Character Sequences In the simplest case, one could store a string as an array of characters. Hence one has a continuous part of the memory, where each byte is interpreted as a character. As we know, the memory doesn't have data types. Hence each byte just contains a natural number in \\([0, 2&#94;8 - 1]\\) . It is only how we interpret those numbers that makes it a character. ASCII ASCII is a standard. It maps 7 bit numbers (yes, 7, not 8 - ASCII is old) to characters. Hence it defines how all of those 128 possible numbers should be interpreted: Number Character Description Number Character Description 0 NULL ( \\0 ) 1 START OF HEADING 2 START OF TEXT 3 END OF TEXT 4 END OF TRANSMISSION 5 ENQUIRY 6 ACKNOWLEDGE 7 BELL 8 BACKSPACE 9 CHARACTER TABULATION ( \\t ) 10 LINE FEED (LF) 11 LINE TABULATION 12 FORM FEED (FF) 13 CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) ( \\r ) 14 SHIFT OUT 15 SHIFT IN 16 DATA LINK ESCAPE 17 DEVICE CONTROL ONE 18 DEVICE CONTROL TWO 19 DEVICE CONTROL THREE 20 DEVICE CONTROL FOUR 21 NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE 22 SYNCHRONOUS IDLE 23 END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK 24 CANCEL 25 END OF MEDIUM 26 SUBSTITUTE 27 ESCAPE 28 INFORMATION SEPARATOR FOUR 29 INFORMATION SEPARATOR THREE 30 INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO 31 INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE 32 SPACE 33 !

So it makes use of the last bit and defines the number 160 to 255. Yes, there is an undefined gap. So this extension helped a lot of languages (e.g. French and German). But it was not enough. And it was a mess, pretty soon. Other character encodings like ISO 8859-2 , ISO 8859-3 , ..., ISO 8859-16 were created. Now exchanging documents between those formats becomes a mess. You've probably experienced it when suddenly the replacement character � appears in an application. Or something like ¿½. Unicode Unicode is a standard ( link ). It defines a number - the unicode code point -, the glyph which belongs to this number, a short textual description of the glyph and an example how it could look like. Unicode code points are just identifier. In contrast, in ASCII the numbers are both an identifier and how the character is represented in the memory. For example, the codepoint U+0041 has the description LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A as shown nicely on fileformat.info . This notation uses an hexadecimal base. Hence the number is \\((41)_{16} = 16 \\cdot 4 + 1 = 65\\) - just like ASCII! In fact, Unicode is a superset of ASCII. And of Latin-1. Unicode 10 contains 136 690 characters and 139 writing systems. It has Emoji, mathematical symbols and musical symbols. You can search mathematical symbols with write-math.com and Emoticons with unicode.party . An interesting concept in Unicode are combining characters. For example, a female firefighter is represented by the women code point and by the fire engine code point. UTF-8 UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible Unicode code points. The name is short for Transformation Format - 8 bit. It uses between 1 and 4 bytes to represent Unicode code points. So while Unicode defines an identifier for the concepts of characters, UTF-8 defines how those are stored in memory. There were issues with byte order (high endian, low endian; see Byte Order Mark (BOM)) which are fixed with UTF-8. UTF-8 uses between one and 6 bytes per character. Alternatives: UCS-2 : Use two bytes for a unicode character. Always. high-endian UCS-2 low-endian UCS-2 UCS-4 : Store each code point in 4 bytes - hence it blows up english text to have 4x the size. UTF-7 UTF-16 : Represent the Unicode code point by itself. Used by .NET and Java. Fonts Fonts are a completely different story. Each character can have a font, but it stays the same. A font just deals with the appearence, whereas the Unicode code point defines what it is. The concept. The encoding defines how it is stored in the memory. Interestingly, there can't be a single font which covers all unicode symbols, because OpenType is limited to 65536 glyphs. The GNU Unicode Font covers over 34,000 characters ( source ) Font family Usually, you only want to define a font family. If you make the text bold, the font changes but the font family is still the same. By using font families it seems to be possible to cover more symbols than 65536. For example, noto seems to have a lot. How to use it C L\"Literal UCS-2 string\" C++ wchar_t (\"wide char\") Python Use either UCS2* or UCS4 for unicode characters. Which one is used is a compile time option. The unicode(your_string) function creates a unicode object from the given encoded string. Don't forget to put # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the beginning of all of your scripts. Python 2 Python 3 What it does unicode Object str Object handles text. Can be encoded (utf-8, latin-1) str Object bytes plain sequence of bytes By using from __future__ import unicode_literals you get the default behaviour of Python 3 within Python 2: All \"string literals\" are unicode strings. Otherwise, they are byte strings. A couple of really helpful examples from Bakuriu : >>> len ( u 'à' ) # a single code point 1 >>> len ( 'à' ) # by default utf-8 -> takes two bytes 2 >>> len ( u 'à' . encode ( 'utf-8' )) 2 >>> len ( u 'à' . encode ( 'latin1' )) # in latin1 it takes one byte 1 >>> print u 'à' . encode ( 'utf-8' ) # terminal encoding is utf-8 à >>> print u 'à' . encode ( 'latin1' ) # it cannot understand the latin1 byte � Pitfalls Some pitfalls are listed in this SO answer : Counting : The combining code points can generate some confusion on what you might expect and what you get. Similar look, but different : U+006E (n), and U+0303 (a combining tilde) forms ñ, but the code point U+00F1 forms ñ Equality, the second : There is Latin A , CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A and GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA . The same look, but not the same codepoint. See also Joel Spolsky: The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)

I've never been in a multi-label context, so it was not directly clear to me which scoring is used. Thanks to Chirag Nagpal who pointed me in the right direction. Let \\(Y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}&#94;k\\) be the set of correct labels for document \\(i\\) and \\(Z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}&#94;k\\) be the set of predicted labels: Binary Accuracy : For each document, one has to make a decision for each possible category. Hence \\(\\text{acc} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\frac{|Y_i \\cap Z_i|}{k}\\) . As most documents belong to one or two categories, the simplest classifier simply decides all the time that the document does not belong to any category. For the used dataset, this leads to an accuracy of 0.986. Hence accuracy is not suitable. Subset Accuracy : This is calculated by sklearn . The set of predicted labels must be exactly the same as the true labels. F1 score : See user manual Micro/macro averaged ROC or Precision/Recall curve: Micro: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives. Macro: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account. Coverage error: See user manual A nice overview is given by A Literature Survey on Algorithms for Multi-label Learning . n-gram Features See N-Gram-Based Text Categorization: Categorizing Text With Python . I will give this a try when I find some time. If you make it before, please share the results. You could adjust my tf-idf code . Classifier comparison (tf-idf) The following are the accuracies as well as the training and test times. All classifiers got the same tf-idf features. Used vocabulary size = 26147 Classifier Acc F1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MLP : 82.61% 85.56% in 676.44s train / 0.91s test LinearSVC : 81.05% 84.04% in 27.00s train / 6.45s test Logistic Regression (C=1000) : 80.79% 84.10% in 35.48s train / 6.46s test k nn 5 : 72.97% 76.07% in 9.89s train / 1092.29s test k nn 3 : 72.28% 75.43% in 9.90s train / 1080.20s test Logistic Regression (C=1) : 67.47% 67.21% in 30.22s train / 6.44s test Random Forest (200 estimators): 65.75% 64.36% in 57.56s train / 4.15s test Random Forest (50 estimators) : 64.79% 63.69% in 14.82s train / 1.30s test Decision Tree : 55.75% 53.23% in 28.43s train / 0.22s test Naive Bayes : 43.86% 47.98% in 214.75s train / 88.79s test SVM, linear : 33.55% 29.67% in 6326.33s train / 2397.51s test There are a couple of things to notice here: Speed : Naive Bayes and k-nn is slow Random forests and MLP are fast SVM depends extremely on the implementation (see What is the difference between LinearSVC and SVC(kernel=\"linear\")? ) Prediction Quality : LinearSVC, logistic regression and MLP are accurate Achieving high binary accuracy seems to be easier than achieving high F1 scores. It's no surprise that high subset accuracy is hard to achieve. The MLP has a reasonable prediction quality and test time. Multilayer Perceptron When training a multilayer perceptron for a multi-label classification task, there are two important things to keep in mind: Output layer : Do not use softmax, as the normalization does not make sense in this case. Loss : Use `binary_crossentropy When you print precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy you note the following: Binary accuracy gets to 98% in the first epoch and over 99% in the second. It stays that high. Precision is at about 4% in the first epoch and over 97% in the second. It stays that high. Recall needs about 15 epochs of steady progress to get over 98%. As a consequence, the F1 score steadily increases. Hence by using other metrics one can see that the classifier makes great improvements, although the accuracy is pretty high from the beginning.

Suppose you have a text classification problem. For example, you want to classify incoming emails as (C1) spam (C2) notifications (C3) personal. Hence each email belongs to exactly one of three classes. Basic Setup Suppose you have corpus of 1000 emails. You make a stratified split into 600 training emails and 400 test emails. The class C1 is 40% of the data, C2 is 10% of the data and C3 is 50% of the data in both, the training and the test set. Don't touch the test set until the very end. Let \\(I_1 \\subsetneq 1, \\dots, 600\\) be the set of indices of emails which belong to class C1, \\(I_2 \\subsetneq 1, \\dots, 600\\) be the set of indices of emails which belong to set C2 and \\(I_3 \\subsetneq 1, \\dots, 600\\) be the set of emails which belong to set C3. Get Features Now you build a list of unique words \\(w\\) . Let \\(W \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) denote the total number of unique words in the training set. So you know which words appear in the documents in the training set. There are certainly words which you did not see in the training set. Don't worry about this. Let the count how often word \\(w\\) appears in email \\(i = 1, \\dots, N\\) be denoted by \\(n_{w,i} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) . Let \\(n_{w, \\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;N n_{w,i}\\) be the count how often the word \\(w\\) appears in all documents combined. Word Presence Feature For each word, you can have a binary feature: Either the word is in the e-mail or not. I call this the \"word presence feature\". Now you can calculate: If a word \\(w\\) appears in a document, the probability that the e-mail belongs to class 1 is $$P(C_1|w) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_1} 1_{n_{w,i} \\geq 1}}{n_{w, \\text{u}} = \\sum_{i \\in I_1 \\cup I_2 \\cup I_3} 1_{n_{w,i} \\geq 1}}$$ Hence you divide the number of e-mails of the first class in which the word \\(w\\) appeared at least once by the total count of e-mails in which the word \\(w\\) appeared at least once. Ok, but you don't only have one feature, but many. You are interested in \\(P(C_1 | w_1, \\dots, w_N)\\) . By applying Bayes Rule, we get: \\begin{align} P(C_1 | w_1, \\dots, w_N) &= \\frac{P(w_1, \\dots, w_N | C_1) \\cdot P(C_1)}{P(w_1, \\dots, w_N)}\\\\ &= \\frac{P(w_1 | C_1) \\cdot P(w_2 | w_2, C_1) \\dots \\cdot P( w_{N} |w_1, \\dots, w_{N-1}, C_1) \\cdot P(C_1)}{P(w_1, \\dots, w_N)} \\end{align} Now, \\(P(C_1) = 0.4\\) is called the a priori probability of the class \\(C_1\\) . So if we knew nothing about the content of the e-mail, we would guess \\(C_1\\) has a probability of 40% as it is the amout of e-mails in that class. The other terms are more difficult. We don't have enough data for this. So we make the simplifying (and wrong!) assumption that words are independant of each other. Then we get: \\begin{align} P(C_1 | w_1, \\dots, w_N) &= \\frac{P(w_1 | C_1) \\cdot P(w_2 | C_1) \\dots \\cdot P( w_{N} | C_1) \\cdot P(C_1)}{P(w_1, \\dots, w_N)} \\end{align} As we know that $$1 = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;3 P(C_i | w_1, \\dots, w_N)$$ it is sufficient to calculate the nominators and divide each of the three denominators by the sum of all three. Congratulations, your first document classifier is working! Tf-idf For each word, we can measure how often it appears in a given e-mail. Certainly, the more often it appears the more important it is. But the longer the e-mail is, the less important it is. So we should divide by the total count of words of an e-mail. This is called the term frequency (Tf) of a word in a document (e-mail). Sometimes, this is also denoted by \\(\\text{tf}(w, d)\\) where \\(w\\) is the word (term) and \\(d\\) is the document (e-mail). Next, we realize that some words contain more information than others. For example, the word \"the\" might occur in almost every document. We do so by dividing by $$\\text{idf}(w, D) = \\frac{N}{|d \\in D: w \\in d|}$$ where \\(N = 600\\) is the total amount of documents we have in the training set. The denominator is the total count of words in all documents in the training set combined. Hence we can get a Tf-idf feature for all words. You can see that this allows us to apply the same Bayesian approach as before. In fact, you should now see that the Bayesian approach is not part of the features, but a classifier! And if you look at the tf-idf Wikipedia page you can see that there are a couple of similar features! Terms instead of Words I've only talked about words before, but you can calculate tf-idf for terms , too. Take \"New York\" as an example. You might see \"New\" in an e-mail and you might see \"York\" in an e-mail. But the combined term \"New York\" is something different than seeing both single words. Hence you might want to have the tf-idf feature of \"New York\", too. Classifiers I've introduced the Bayes Classifer, but there are a lot more. Most notably: SVMs Neural Networks Decision Trees (and Random Forests) See my Comparing Classifiers for a lot more classifiers. Feature Engineering One thing I would try to find out is which features are really good. You can probably figure out keywords with this approach. Hence you can make sense of the decision. And you might be able to throw away a lot of words. PCA / LDA are two feature reduction methods that might be interesting. Other methods are: Forward Feature Construction: Start with an empty set of features. For each feature not in the feature list: Find the one where adding it leads to the best accuracy. If the desired accuracy is reached, stop. Otherwise continue with 2. Feature Elimination Start with all features. For each feature in the feature list: Try where removing it leads to the least loss in accuracy. If the accuracy dropped below the required accuracy, stop and take the last feature list. Otherwise, continue with 2. Evaluation Last, but not least, I suggest the following approach to evaluate what you apply for your e-mail classifier: Split the training set into 500 e-mails for training and 100 e-mails for validation Traing all methods you guess on the 500 e-mails. Evluate on the 100 e-mails what is best. Make sure everything is what you think it should be like. Run your experiments with those 500 / 100 e-mails When you're finished, evaluate on the 400 e-mails your final setup. Only once. This is your estimate how good you really are. You might also want to have a look at cross-validation.

Some think about Apple products, websites or art. When I say design, I mean it as a very general concept. For this article, I mean usability. How to structure things. And things could be websites or phones, but also anything else. This article is mainly an excercise for me to keep my eyes open and recognize good and bad designs in the wild. Citys Company buildings / stores should be placed towards streets. So people can easily see them. Living spaces should be in buildings in the back. House Kitchen Let's take my kitchen as an example: My kitchen The general placement of the sink is good: You want to be able to have space on both sides so that you can have the dirty stuff on one side, clean it, and put it on the clean side. This way you don't have to lift anything dirty over the clean tableware. And you want to have the stove on the side where the dirty stuff is, because if you make something in the pan the fat could make the stuff around dirty. But thinking a bit more about it, you can see a downside of this kitchen: The sink has no included rack. This means when I lift something out of the sink and put it on the table rack to the left, the table gets wet. Modern sinks all have this: A modern sink has a place where you can put the wet stuff. It has its own drain. So the layout of a kitchen should be like this: Layout of a kitchen: Some place on the very right, then the stove, then some place for dirty plates, the sink, and an integrated board where you can put the clean, wet plates. For me, it feels a bit more natural to take things from the right side, but the mirrored version is fine, too. Doors Doors should never open to the corridor. People might go fast through corridors and opening doors could cause injuries. Residential buildings: It should be possible to open a door a bit more than 90°. If it is opened like this, the door should be placed wide enough away from the next wall so that you can put a small shelf behind it. Bathroom Shower curtains: Do not use them. They are cheap, yes. But they get pulled in by the temperature difference. They look bad. They get dirty and have to be replaced. Washing machines: They should always have a display which shows how long they need to finish. Receipts Receipts are designed quite bad. In order to give you a feeling for it, have a look at the following: 3 Receipts of Penny, Lidl and Aldi Useful for the customer Green: Adress Orange: Opening times Blue: What was bought and when Black: Might be required by law Trash for the customer: Pink: Advertisement Turquoise: Might be useful for the company; information about the transaction Yellow: Trash for everybody How could it be done better? Just design it like a letter: Adress and opening times at the top (Lidl has a good format) Then the Date Then what was bought (again, Lidl has a good format there - make the end price significantly larger than the rest) Put legal stuff next Put stuff you need for your busines last And especially: Reduce everything which might not be necessary for the customer to a minimum. Medicine Package Inserts Package insert of medicine There are a couple of things to notice here: A lot of text Only in German No (obvious) way to find it in another language I would expect the following: Make the name very obvious ✔ Add an URL where you can download the receipt as a (searchable) PDF ✘ Make blocks for important sections ✔ Use standardized icons for some sections: Pregnancy (there is a Unicode symbol ) Interactions with other medicine (e.g. ⇄) What it is for (e.g. 🛈) How / when / how much to take (e.g. ⏰) Interactions with preconditions (e.g. 🤒 or 😷 or 🤕) Driving and heavy machineary (e.g. 🚗) Storage (e.g. ❄) Possible side-effects (e.g. 💊 → 🤒) Add a description how the medicine looks like! Laptop An office laptops (for work / studying) needs to have the following: Easy possiblity to connect to beamers Easy to carry Lightweight enough, including all power supplies / adapaters Easy to grab, even if you have multiple other things to carry Power supply: For gods sake, make standardized power supplies! I understand that we need more than one (e.g. office laptops vs. gaming laptops)... but certainly we do not need more than 5! It was possible for smartphones with the common EPS (yes, Apple has a bad design here again), so please make something similar for laptops too.

Imagine you have a web service. Then you usually not only have your own software, but you built it with other libraries. You run it on a web server. The server needs some configuration, exposes some ports, reads and writes data. Being a good developer, you identified different components which can be built (and scaled) independently (aka microservices). They have a way to talk with each other and they need to run in order to make the service work. As you are the developer, you know what you need. But you might not be the one who deploys the software. Hence you have to write documentation about it. And you can create a (Docker) container. Glossary Image An image is an immutable file which contains the application code, the operating system, the required software. They are created with docker build . Images can be stored in a registry such as hub.docker.com . An image is defined using a Dockerfile . Typically, an image is built on another image. You can list images on your machine with docker images . Container A virtual operating system. It is an instance of an image. A container is created with docker run . A methaphor used by paislee is that an image is a class and a container is an object. They encapsulate the environment in which the application runs. docker ps -a lists all containers - running and stopped. Docker Compose A tool for defining and running multi-container applications. Docker Swarm A tool to deploy containers in a cluster. Similar to Kubernetes. Kubernetes A tool to deploy containers in a cluster. Similar to Docker Swarm. Context Containers vs Virtual Machines Resource sharing / isolation : Docker containers share resources. A docker container is similar to a host process, hence the memory / CPU scheduling will be handled by the host for Docker. Docker is less isolated than a VM. Docker containers use less disk space and less memory. Startup time : A VM takes minutes to start, Docker takes seconds to start Kernel : Docker containers share the same kernel (the host kernel) whereas each virtual machine has its own kernel. Alternatives Although Docker seems to be by far the most common container tool, there are alternatives: Rocket LXD Flockport And there are VMs: VirtualBox VMware Workstation Using Docker First, install Docker . Dockerfile A Dockerfile defines an image. It is a simple text file which could look as follows: FROM ubuntu:latest LABEL maintainer=\"info@martin-thoma.de\" # Settings for the local user ENV APP_USER docker ENV APP_USER_UID 9999 ENV APP_USER_GROUP docker ENV APP_USER_GROUP_GID 4711 # Install and update software RUN apt-get update -y RUN apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev build-essential RUN apt-get upgrade -y # Copy projects code COPY . /opt/app WORKDIR /opt/app RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # Create user RUN groupadd --gid ${ APP_USER_GROUP_GID } ${ APP_USER_GROUP } RUN useradd --uid ${ APP_USER_UID } --create-home -g ${ APP_USER_GROUP } ${ APP_USER } RUN chown -R $APP_USER : $APP_USER_GROUP /opt/app # Start app USER docker RUN mkdir -p /opt/app/uploads ENTRYPOINT [\"python\"] CMD [\"app.py\"] Let's go through it: FROM defines on which base image we built our image. We add another layer to that one. LABEL : Add metadata in a key=value based fashion to the image. RUN <command> : Execute this. COPY <src> <dest> : Copy files from src on the host to dest in the container. WORKDIR /abs/path/to/workdir : Work directory for and RUN , CMD , ENTRYPOINT instruction that follows ENTRYPOINT [\"executable\", \"param1\", \"param2\"] : Run this when the Docker container is started. CMD [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"] : The command is to run via the entrypoint. Commands Docker needs to be run in super-user mode. I indicate that with # . You can run sudo su in order to run all subsequent commands as a superuser. List all images: # docker image ls List all running containers: # docker container ls Go into an interactive ( -i ) bash in a pseudo-tty ( -t ) in a container with ID 4f7d3f0763ad : # docker exec -it 4f7d3f0763ad bash Volumes If you copy the code directly into the image, you need to rebuild the image every time you make a change to the code. In order to prevent this, you can use volumes. There are two types of volumes: Persist and share data between containers Share folders between host and containers List volumes: # docker volume ls Remove volumes: # docker volume rm <volume name> docker-compose.yml The docker-compose.yml is a YAML file which defines multi-container applications. It looks like this: version: '3' # Version number of the docker-compose file format services: web: build: . command: app.py ports: - \"8082:5000\" volumes: - .:/opt/app # enables hot code reloading - uploads:/opt/app/uploads # for data persistance (<volume name>:<abs path in container>) links: - db hostname: myappserver environment: - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd123 - MYSQL_DATABASE=flask_db - MYSQL_HOST=db - MYSQL_PORT=3306 depends_on: - db db: image: mysql ports: - \"3307:3306\" environment: - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd123 - MYSQL_DATABASE=flask_db - MYSQL_HOST=mysqlserver volumes: - ./flask_db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/flask_db.sql volumes: uploads: driver: local Start it with docker-compose up .

The more users use the system, the more data the system gets. This is an awesome property, but what do you do if you don't have any / enough data to create a useful system? How do you bootstrap a machine learning system? I will take write-math.com (handwritten symbol recognition) and Amazon book recommendations as examples. Generate Data yourself Sometimes, it is possible to generate data yourself. This is what I did for write-math.com. It could be expected that users are not too different - after all, single symbols should look somewhat similar, no matter who wrote them. This is not possible for Amazon recommendations as they are mainly dependant on the user. Ask friends You can ask friends / collegues to use your system and feed it with data. I did this with write-math.com, too. Gamification Sometimes, you can make a game which is interesting enough to attract users to use your system and feed it with data. For example, Google did this with Quickdraw . Side-steping Some tasks can be re-formulated so that they are intersting for other problems. Examples are Asirra and reCaptcha: You are given 12 images. Your task is to identify all images which contain dogs. The developer knows the content of 11 images. If you get those 11 right, some trust is put into your classification of the 12th image. Similar, for reCaptcha you are given two words. The developer knows one of them. It is placed randomly on the left or the right. If you get that one right, some trust is put into your classification of the other one. Another example is Duolingo. Alternative Algorithms You could use other algorithms with do not need data. Expert systems are examples for this kind of algorithm. Just let an expert hand-craft rules. This could work for Amazon recommendations: Get besteller lists to rank books initially. As soon as the user liked one book of one author, add a little bit to the score of all other books of that author. Users who bought one edition of a book usually don't buy the same book in another edition. Hence reduce the score for them. ... Sparse matrix completion For recommendation systems, you can define user \"prototypes\" (\"the nerd\", \"the artist\", \"the gamer\", ...). Define their properties. Find one person for each prototype. Let them rank the books. Not necessarily every book, but many. You could add rules to infer the ranking of missing books.

They take hundrets of features and predict thousands of classes. The features can often not be seen independantly, but have to be taken as a whole into consideration. Most parameters are not independant either. And still, we use only on the order of several ten-thousand to a million data points to optimize the millions of parameters in a network. We know that more labeled data leads to better results, but labeling is costly. Obtaining more data, however, is comparatively cheap. Hence we want to use the unlabeled data to learn good features. The complete process is semi-supervised and works as follows: Unsupervised training : Train a neural network with unlabeled data Network modification : Change something in the network. Often, the output layer is adjusted. Supervised training : Train the neural network with labeled data In the following, I will introduce all unsupervised training methods I know. Auto-Encoders The idea of an auto-encoder is to restore the input. Hence it has to have an output layer which is capable of doing so. This means you have to choose your activation function carefully and probably normalize the range of values of the input. For example, if your inputs have negative values you cannot use the logistic function or ReLU. If it doesn't sum to one, you can't use softmax. If the range of values is outside of [-1, 1], you can't use most of the activation functions. Also, you have to make sure the shape of the output is the same as the input. After that, you have multiple options: Bottleneck features: You can force the auto-encoder to learn a feature reduction by introducing a bottleneck. After the training is finished, everything after the bottleneck could be removed. Restauration: The input of the network is changed in some way which has to be restored by the network. This could be white noise, Gaussian noise, or completely removing some parts of the image (as done in Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting ). Look for \"denoising auto-encoder\". Literature: Jonathan Masci, Ueli Meier, Dan Ciresan, and Jürgen Schmidhuber: Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoders for Hierarchical Feature Extraction Crop position prediction If you have a CNN and images as input, crop it into 9 pieces which are loosely placed in a grid over the image (with some variable padding). Give the network the middle crop and randomly one of the 8 others. The network has to predict which crop it got. Hence the network has 8 output units. Predict the position of an image crop Image source: Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning by Context Prediction Literature: Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros: Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning by Context Prediction Order I could imagine that you could do something similar to the crop position prediction with time series data. For example, if you have audio data you could give the network two samples and let it predict which one comes first. Or if you have a video, you can predict the next frame. See Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning . Predict the next frame of a video. Image source: Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning Weakly Supervision The more detailed / high quality labels are, the more expensive. For example, it is often simpler to classify one complete image than to assign a class label to each pixel of the image. But you can build models for semantic segmentation without having a single image which was semantically labeled. This is what I call weak supervision . Another example is counting: You have many images of street scenes. Each image has the number of cars in that image as a label. The idea is that a neural network should learn a car classifier from this information. I think I have seen something similar before, but I don't remember where (NIPS 2016?) More I have seen Discriminative Unsupervised Feature Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks but I didn't understand what they are doing. They take a random patch of one image, apply random data augmentations to that image and assign it a (random) class.

You might find find patterns like: Albert Einstein, born in Ulm, ... Albert Einstein (1879, Ulm) ... One son of Ulm is Albert Einstein. Now you can extract language patterns: X, born in Y, ...

Smoothing A common task in NLP is estimating the probability of a word given some other words: \\(P(w_i | w_{i-1}, w_{i-2})\\) . You can do that by counting n-grams \\((w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_{i})\\) : $$P(w_i | w_{i-1}, w_{i-2}) = \\frac{N((w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_i))}{N((w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}))}$$ But you will quite often have the case that you did not see a 3-gram. How do you deal with that? Smoothing is the answer. The simplest method is Laplace Smoothing (aka Add-one smoothing). How do you deal with words you've never seen? The Good-Turing smoothing method uses things you've seen once to estimate things you've never seen: $$P&#94;*_{GT}(\\text{things never seen}) = \\frac{N_1}{N}$$ $$P&#94;*_{GT}(\\text{thing seen}) = (\\frac{(c+1) N_{c+1}}{N_c}) / N$$ when \\(c\\) bekomes \"large\" (depends on the dataset), just replace \\(N_c\\) by a best-fit power law. Other smoothing methods Interpolated Kneser-Ney Good-Turing Smoothing Stupid backoff: For very large N-grams Another important concept is the continuation probability. While some words (like \"a\", \"to\", \"the\", ...) can be followed / preceeded by many different words, others (like \"San\", \"Angelo\", \"D.C.\", \"United States of\", ...). The continuation probability quantifies how likely it is that a word is continued by something novel. Putting this together with absolute discounting gives the Kneser-Ney Smoothing algorithm: $$P_{KN}(w_i | w_{i-1}) = \\frac{\\max( c(w_{i-1}, w_i) - d, 0)}{c(w_{i-1})} + \\lambda (w_{i-1}) P_{continuation}(w_i)$$ where \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) weights how important the continuation probability is, Data structures Bloom filter : a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set Trie : A prefix-tree Resources KIT: The ASR course has some NLP content Reddit: /r/LanguageTechnology StackExchange: datascience.stackexchange.com Online Courses: Coursera: Introduction to Natural Language Processing Stanford: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning on YouTube: Stanford NLP Oxford: Lecture Notes Machine Translation","tags":"Machine Learning","title":"Natural Language Processing"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/cfg-files-defaults/","text":"I often need configuration files in the software I develop. In principle, I can think of two ways to deal with configuration files: Complete : The configuration file has to have all values which will later be accessed by the application Partial : The configuration file might only define some values. In case the application needs a value which is not in the user defined configuration file, a default value is used. The complete approach has the major drawback of making updates difficult. The user(s) might have different configuration files for different usage scenarios. In the worst case the user has to update his files manually, just because the developer added a couple of possibilities to customize the application. Hence I prefer the partial approach where a default configuration file is part of the application. This default config file will not be overwritten. It contains all values necessary for the user. But the user may define a user config file which he may adjust. The user can peek at the default file to see what he can customize, but he can keep his config file clean.

It is interesting that Amazon is seen as the only online retailer, but as it certainly is the biggest retailer in Germany I will focus on it for now. To make the following simpler to write, lets say Steven wants Alice to buy stuff in shops while Alice usually uses Amazon. Why Amazon replaces Retail Stores Price : Alice mainly cares about the price. And in many cases, Amazon sells the product for the cheapest price or is at least competitive. Range of products : Amazon offers pretty much everything. There are only a few products which you can find in stores but not on Amazon. Why should Alice bother to go to a store if she might end up buying it on Amazon anyway because the store does not have the production she is looking for? Reliability : At the beginning, Alice worried what she could do if something went wrong. If the product she bought didn't arrive. If it was damaged. If she changed her mind and wanted to give it back. But after a couple of years she built up trust. In contrast to the local store, she knows Amazon. She never had a problem. She doesn't even know anybody personally who ever had a problem which could not be resolved. But with local shops, she already had a couple of problems. The most simple was is loosing the receipt. Simple to use : Alice goes on amazon.de, searches for the product name (and he doesn't need to remember the correct name due to fuzzy search). She clicks on the product, on buy. That's it. Buying a product can be done within a few seconds. No need to go out of the house. Alice already has an Amazon account, so there is no need to create a new account. Anonymity : For some products, Alice might feel uncomfortable to buy them from a person. It doesn't matter that the information that the user bought a product is stored by Amazon. It's not a top-secret thing. And Alice trusts Amazon that they do not make her purchases public. Recommendations : Once in a while Alice goes to Amazon to buy something and gets a good recommendation for another product. It's just so simple to buy this one, too. So quite a bit of the advantage is just that online shops have advantages over local shops. The other bit is the massive size of Amazon and the data it gets. Stevens arguments Steven predicts that local shops will close if Alice doesn't buy her stuff in those shops. This is a really shitty argument. Why should a person who does not buy something in a store care if the store is closed? It might even be desirable because there is more room for stores Alice actually cares about. Or more room for apartments. Steven continues that people working in local shops will loose their jobs . Alice mentions coachman, litter carriers and wagon makers who lost their jobs by the automobile, bank clerks who are replaced by cash dispensers, Charcoal burners , type setters, ... Probably all of them demanded not to use the technology by which they lost their jobs. What is different in this case? Steven says Amazon does not pay taxes and does not treat their workers fair. Well, this might be a valid reason. But then you would have to check the conditions of the shops which you use instead, too. And, after all, it is the duty of politics and worker organizations to force all employers to have fair working conditions. How to fix it Most advantages of Amazon are mainly advantages of online shops. Except for cloths, food and a few very special items Alice does not need to see the item before she buys it. She only needs to know the specifications. If single shops really wanted to break the power of Amazon, they could collaboratively create one online shop. Not every shop on its own, but together. One open shopping platform. Many small shops and some bigger shops could be shareholders of this platform. Probably the government should also be a big shareholder of it. Just to make sure that the interests of many people are considered. It might not even be necessary to actually sell the product online, but just to have a list of currently available products online. Then Alice could check where the closest shop is that has this product and buy it there instead of Amazon. Apparently, the situation of those small shops is not so bad. Otherwise they could start creating such a shop. The Einzelhandelsverband , for example, claims to have 100 000 members. Seems to be big enough to start such an open platform. In fact, there is a platform called fairmondo which tried this. But the retails did not join it. The real problems Amazon is a monopoly. One company dominates online sales. Businesses can use Amazons platform to sell their products, but Amazon can also not allow some of them to sell it. Amazon can (and does) analyze which kind of product is easy to produce and get sold often. They have the data what kinds of features are important to the customers. So they can shift product by product from only a platform which sells products to producing the products themselves. Now, what happens if Amazon is down? What happens if the US government decides to put sanctions on a country? Also, Amazon is bigger than you might think. But Amazon AWS is probably another topic.

Sie hat eine Wohnfläche von 105 m², 2 Schlafzimmer, ist vollständig möbliert und wurde vor kurzem renoviert. Hier finden Sie einige Fotos: http://imgur.com/a/c1Qav Die Immobilie kann auch unmöbliert gemietet werden, in diesem Fall sorge ich für den Abtransport und die Lagerung der Möbel. Die Wohnung hat eine Klimaanlage, Geschirrspüler, Herd, Kühlschrank / Gefrierschrank, Waschmaschine, LED-TV, Staubsauger etc. Die Nebenkosten (Wasser, Strom, Internet, Kabelfernsehen) sind in der Miete von 350 € bereits enthalten und werden monatlich automatisch von meinem Konto beglichen. Wie Sie sehen können, die Miete ist sehr erschwinglich. Ich bin nicht die Wohnung für einen Gewinn zu mieten. Ich ziehe jemanden zu haben, es verwenden, anstatt es leer zu halten. Die Kaution in Höhe von 450 € wird Ihnen bei Auszug erstattet (eine Anmeldung 30 Tage im Voraus ist dafür nötig). Haustiere sind erlaubt, sofern sie keinen ernsten Schaden anrichten. Nun ein bisschen zu meiner Person: Mein Name ist Gregory Barnett und ich bin Bauingenieur aus Grossbritannien. Ich habe die Wohnung gekauft und renoviert, als ich 2014 für 10 Monate in Deutschland gelebt und gearbeitet habe. Nun bin ich dauerhaft wieder in England, suche also einen zuverlässigen Mieter. Am besten wäre ein Vertrag von langer Dauer, muss aber nicht unbedingt so sein. Leider kann ich in den nächsten Monaten aus beruflichen und gesundheitlichen Gründen nicht mehr ins Ausland reisen, kann Sie daher auch nicht sofort persönlich treffen. Daher habe ich eine örtliche Immobilienagentur mit großer Erfahrung im Bereich internationaler Vermietungen beauftragt, den ganzen Vorgang abzuwickeln. Die Kosten dafür werde ich vollständig übernehmen. Also, wenn Ihnen das zusagt, lassen Sie mich wissen, mit wie vielen Personen Sie beabsichtigen, einzuziehen und für welchen Zeitraum. Über nähere Informationen zu Ihrer Person würde ich mich außerdem sehr freuen. Sie können in Englisch oder Deutsch antworten. Viele Grüße und einen schönen Tag noch!

As I send a couple of requests I'm not quite sure about which one you're talking. Could you please send me the link to it? (or at least the address) I am seeking a flat only for myself. I am a software engineer and I want to rent the flat from the beginning of June. Right now, I don't know how long I will stay but likely for several years. Best regards (and get well soon), Martin Antwort \"Mietverfahren\" von Gregory Barnett <gregorybarnett90@gmail.com> Thank you for replying, The property is managed by Chelsea Homes, a local real estate agency, specialized in international transactions. Their website is: www.chelsea-homes.co.uk . They will arrange a viewing for you, and handle the payments and contract. Also if you have any questions, feel free to contact them anytime you need, because I might not always be available. You can find their details on the Contact page of their website. Now here's how the rental works: 1. First you need to register with the agency at: www.chelsea-homes.co.uk/register.html by entering your details in the form and clicking SUBMIT. 2. I'll drop off 2 sets of keys and the necessary paperwork at their office 3. The agency will email you the invoice for the first rent (350€)+ Kaution (450€). This is just to reserve the property, and not a final commitment of course,. Once you've made the payment, the agency will book the viewing for you, and within 1-2 days, one of their agents will meet you in Germany to show you the property and help you with all the formalities. 4. After the viewing, if you're satisfied with the place you will sign a contract with the agent and receive the keys so you can move in. However if you don't like the apartment, for whatever reason, you will have no obligations and the full payment will be refunded by the agent immediately. The whole procedure shouldn't take more than 3 days in total. I'm paying for the services of the agency, so there will be no extra costs for you. Also, in case you're tied up in another contract and cannot move in immediately, we can arrange the viewing now, and reserve the apartment for you. Since we're unable to meet in person I've attached a copy of my passport, so you can have a reference of your potential landlord. Please consider my offer and let me know if we have a deal, because there are several others interested in the apartment, and I need to make a decision soon.

Let me explain you the process step by step for a better understanding: - I will list the property on Uniplaces for EUR 550 per month with bills included . The rental contract can be made for at least 2 months - up to 5 years. - You will have to pay 2 months deposit ( EUR 1100) to Uniplaces in order to confirm your booking. This 2 months deposit covers ( 1 months of rent + 1 month security deposit) - All the taxes and bills are included in the rental price; It includes also 1 parking places; - Like mentioned several times a viewing before booking is not possible since I'm not there, but Uniplaces is guaranteeing the whole transaction between us. In case something gets damaged, you can deduct the amount from the rental price, of course with a bill attached. If everything sounds good to you, I'll be able to send you the Uniplaces listing so you can book it at your convenience. Also, in case you have another apartment right now, and you can't move immediately, we can make the agreement as explained here, and consider it only an inspection and reservation until you are able to move there. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best Regards , Anastasiia Bondar Wohnung 5 Von Jonathan Addy <jonnaddy@gmail.com> : Hallo, Die Wohnung ist verfügbar.

Hence whitening decorrelates features. It is used as a preprocessing method. When you have \\(N\\) data points in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) , then the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) is estimated to be: $$\\hat{\\Sigma}_{jk} = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;N (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j) \\cdot (x_{ik} - \\bar{x}_k)$$ where \\(\\bar{x}_j\\) denotes the \\(j\\) -th component of the estimated mean of the samples \\(x\\) . Any matrix \\(W \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) which satisfies the condition $$W&#94;T W = C&#94;{-1}$$ whitens the data. ZCA whitening is the choice \\(W = M&#94;{- \\frac{1}{2}}\\) . PCA is another choice. According to \"Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade\" PCA and ZCA whitening differ only by a rotation. How to do it When you look at the Keras code , you can see the following: # Calculate principal components sigma = np.dot(flat_x.T, flat_x) / flat_x.shape[0] u, s, _ = linalg.svd(sigma) principal_components = np.dot(np.dot(u, np.diag(1. / np.sqrt(s + 10e-7))), u.T) # Apply ZCA whitening whitex = np.dot(flat_x, principal_components) So, at first you compute the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) . I'm not quite sure, but I think they should divide by flat_x.shape[0] - 1 for the unbiased estimator. Then you apply singular value decomposition to the estimated covariance matrix. The matrix \\(u \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) is unitary and \\(s \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. Those number are the singular values of \\(\\Sigma\\) . Next, the principal components are calculated: [u \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s + 10&#94;{-7}}} I \\cdot u&#94;T] By adding 10e-7 one prevents division by zero. Whitening is then simply the multiplication with the principal components.

Before I used a download helper, I used curl . It is a standard tool for downloading files. But there is another standard tool: wget .

Wget's major strong side compared to curl is its ability to download recursively, or even just download everything that is referred to from a remote resource, be it a HTML page or a FTP directory listing. wget can recover from a prematurely broken transfer and continue downloading. Wget enables more features by default: cookies, redirect-following, time stamping from the remote resource etc. With curl most of those features need to be explicitly enabled. Interesting wget options -b : Put the download in background. Interersting for large downloads. --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0\" -i [filename] : Specify a filename with newline separated URLs to download --mirror -p : Download a webpage --convert-links : Convert links for offline viewing -P ./LOCAL-DIR : where to store the webpage --reject=gif : Don't download gif files -Q5m : Stop downloading when the file size exceeds 5 MB Conclusiong Use wget when you want to download a single file or a website.

The simplest way to combine several classifiers is by averaging their predictions. For example, if you have three models and four classes, you might get predictions like this: model 1(x1) = [0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1], model 2(x1) = [0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1], model 3(x1) = [0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1] the ensemble predicts $$\\left [\\frac{0.1+0.5+0.4}{3}, \\frac{0.5+0.3+0.4}{3}, \\frac{0.4+0.2+0.2}{3}, \\frac{0.1+0.1+0.1}{3} \\right] \\approx \\left [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 \\right ]$$ for \\(x_1\\) . Note that this is different from pluarlity voting (PV) where every model gives only one vote for the most likely class. In the case from above, it would be model 1(x1) = [0, 1, 0, 0], model 2(x1) = [1, 0, 0, 0], model 3(x1) = [1, 0, 0, 0] # tie - lets just take the first So the plurality voting ensemble would predict class 1, whereas the average probability ensemble predicts class 2. This comes from the fact that everybody might have different first choices, but they might agree on the second choice. Please note that a tie in the predictions of a classifier with less than 100 classes is unlikely due to the higher precision of floating point numbers. However, a tie in votes can happen. According to Andrej Karpathy, this gives you about +2 percentage points in accuracy. Tiny Experiment on CIFAR 100 I've just tried this with three (almost identical) models for CIFAR 100 . All of them were trained with Adam with the same training data (the same batches). Model 1 and model 3 only differed in the second-last layer (one uses ReLU, the other tanh), model 1 and model 2 only differed in the border mode for one convolutional layer (valid vs same). The accuracies of the single models were: model 1: 57.02 model 2: 61.85 model 3: 48.59 The ensemble accuracy is 62.98%. Hence the ensemble is 1.13 percentage points better than the best single model! Although I have read things like this before, it is the first time I actually tried it myself. Ensemble Techniques There are much more sophisticated ensemble techniques than simple averaging of the output: Bagging How does it work? Train models on different data (Learnier is fit, results are mean/median aggregated) Why is it used? Reduction of variance Common techniques: Random subspaces: Take a part of the features (e.g. Random Forests) Pasting: Take a part of the training data without replacement Boosting How does it work? Train one classifier. Obtain the results. Weight the training data higher if the classifier got it wrong. Train a new classifier on the weighted training data. Iterate. Why is it used? Reduction of bias Examples: AdaBoost , Gradient boosting Stacking How does it work? Train $n$ classifiers on the data. Train a classifier on the predictions of the $n$ classifiers. Why is it used? Reduction of bias and reduction of variance I made some images to make this more clear: Bagging trains the classifiers on different data. Boosting reweights the training data. Stacking trains the combiner.

Loosely speaking, it defines how likely it is (under the assumption of an hypothesis \\(H_0\\) ) to get more extreme results. This is interesting for studies in medicine and similar scenarios. You have a drug and a placebo. You want to figure out if the drug is better than the placebo. Hypothesis testing In statistics, hypothesis testing works as follows: Define a statistical model : This means you have a sample \\(\\mathfrak{X}\\) and an assumption about the distribution of the data. For example, \\(\\mathfrak{X} = \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) where \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) is your sample size and \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma&#94;2)\\) Define a hypothesis and an alternative : For example \\(H_0: \\mu = 100\\) and \\(H_1: \\mu > 100\\) might be hypotheses if you want to check if a drug increases the IQ. Controll errors : You can make two errors. Either \\(H_0\\) is true and you reject it or \\(H_1\\) is true, but you don't reject \\(H_0\\) . In statistics, the first error is usually controlled. So the test is made in such a way that the first error is less than some \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\) . Usually, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) or \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) or even lower. Test statistic : You have a value which indicates something about the parameters in the hypotheses. For example \\(T(X_1, \\dots, X_n) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1} X_i\\) . Test statistic distribution : \\(T\\) itself is a random variable and you can calculate its distribution (e.g. \\(T \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma&#94;2}{n})\\) ). Calculate test decision : Hence you can calculate a \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(P_{H_0}(H_0 \\text{ is rejected}) = P_{H_0}(T \\leq c) \\leq \\alpha\\) . It does not have to be \\(T < c\\) , but often it is. The p value Now note that you could also make it the other way round. You could calculate $$p&#94;* = P_{H_0} (T(X) \\geq T(x))$$ If \\(p&#94;* \\leq \\alpha\\) , then \\(H_0\\) can be rejected on Niveau \\(\\alpha\\) . Interesting statements I just came across the following statments which I think are interesting enough to share them. All of them are wrong. The follwing was takine from a German statistics exam by Dr. Klar (KIT, WS 2013/2014). Assume for the following, that an experiment resulted in a \\(p\\) value of \\(0.01\\) . \\(H_0\\) is certainly false. \\(H_0\\) is with probability \\(0.01\\) false. \\(H_1\\) is certainly correct. You can calculate the probability that \\(H_1\\) is correct with the \\(p\\) value. If one decides to reject \\(H_0\\) , then the \\(p\\) value is the probability of making the wrong decision. The experimental result is reliable, meaning that if the experiment is repeated often one would get a significant result in 99% of the cases. I'm not too sure if (5) is really wrong. p hacking See also The p-Value You Can't Buy","tags":"Mathematics","title":"The p value"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/abs-function/","text":"I was never really taught how to deal with the absolute value function, but I need it from time to time. So here are a few hints. Solving Equations Lets say you want to solve the equation $$|x - a | = b$$ for \\(x\\) . Then you need to realize that this equation is equivalent to two equations: $$x - a = b \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad -(x-a) = b$$ you can solve both of them independantly. You can get 0, 1 or 2 solutions when the absolute function is involved: $$x = a + b \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad x = a - b$$ or shorter $$x = a \\pm b$$ Solving Inequalities Lets say you want to solve the inequality $$|a - x| \\leq b$$ for \\(x\\) . Again, this inequality is equivalent to the two inequalities $$a - x \\leq b \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad -(a-x) \\leq b$$ You can solve both of them independantly for \\(x\\) : $$a - b \\leq x \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad -x \\leq a + b$$ leading to $$a - b \\leq x \\leq a + b$$ Note that both inequalities have to be fulfilled at the same time!

For this reason, I wrote the following article: To help students who come to Germany. General overview In Germany, pre-paid sim cards are pretty good compared to contracts. Well-known providers of pre-paid cards are: Discounters Aldi Talk Lidl Connect Online blau.de (former \"simyo\") simquardat.de Why I like Lidl Connect I haven't used it for long, so take this with a grain of salt. But what I've seen so far is nice: A clean user interface Cheap \"Festznetz-Flat\" (8 Euro - much cheaper than the rest) Prepaid I pay the same in the other countries of the EU - no more \"EU packages\". Simply the same. No roaming. As far as I understand it. This is what finally got me. For my 10 day trip in Barcelona, I paied about 20 Euro to Blau. ( Lidl source , other source ) If you want to switch to Lidl Connect, let me know. I (and you) will get 5 Euro for that. How to get Lidl Connect card Go to a Lidl store. Near the check-out, there are small cardboard cards. When you paid for it, they will give you a similar small \"box\". This box contains the sim card (standard, micro and nano) as well as instructions (German only) Go to Lidl Connect and register a new account with the card you just bought. The card gets activated within 30 minutes. You can login at kundenkonto.lidl-connect.de User Interface User Interface of Lidl Connect The Lidl connect app seems to work fine. It shows the important information. Switching from Blau.de to Lidl As Simyo recently was changed into blau.de (E-Plus), I am a customer of Blau.de. However, the service is worse than the one of Lidl, so I switched. edit: I've recently heard from Marvin that the service hotline of Blau.de asks for the first four characters of your password. So they store the password as plain text. After getting your Lidl Connect card, you have to tell Blau that you want to keep the number (Rufnummernmitnahme). Fill out this form and send it to the address on the form. Your \"SIM-Kartennummer\" is printed on the sim card itself. I sent it on 23.12.2016 to them. I'm still (02.01.2016) waiting for a response. 19.01.2016: Still waiting for a response. I tried to contact them, but the chat was not working. I tried to find a phone number, but there seems not to be any on the website. Only for new contracts. But at least that automatic number said that 0177 177 11 59 is customer service. More than 2 minutes until I reached them. Blau is so shitty. At least the person helped me. 5 minutes later I've got a SMS: Lieber Blau Kunde, Ihre Freigabe der Rufnummer-Mitnahme zu einem anderen Anbieter (Portierungserklärung) für 016123456789 ist eingegangen und gültig bis 20.03.2017.

GTSRB 2017 99.51% accuracy + [Tho17-2] State of the art in this category are CNN models which use skip connections in the form of residual connections or dense connections. The evaluation metrics are straight-forward: Accuracy : Count how many elements of the test dataset you got right, divided by the total number of elements in the test dataset. The accuracy is in \\([0, 1]\\) . Higher is better. Error = 1 - accuracy. The error is in \\([0, 1]\\) . Lower is better. Top-k accuracy : Sometimes, there are either extremely similar classes or the application allows having multiple guesses. Hence not the Top-1 guess of the network has to be right, but the correct label has to be within the top \\(k\\) guesses. The top- \\(k\\) accuracy is in \\([0, 1]\\) . Higher is better. Detection (Images) Face recognition is a special case of detection. Common metrics are: mAP (Mean Average Precision): A detection is successfull, if the bounding box prediction and the true bounding box \\(\\frac{intersection}{union}\\) (IU, IoU) ratio is at least 0.5.

Um Aussagen machen zu können, muss man die Verteilung von $T$ unter der Nullhypothese $H_0$ kennen. Wenn die Verteilung von $T$ der Studentischen-$t$-Verteilung entspricht ($T \\sim t_n$), dann hat man einen $t$-Test. Wenn der Testentscheid, ob $H_0$ verworfen wird so aussieht: $$H_0 \\text{ wird verworfen, falls } T < 123$$ dann liegt ein einseitiger Test vor. Falls der Testentscheid, ob $H_0$ verworfen wird so aussieht: $$H_0 \\text{ wird verworfen, falls } T < -123 \\text{ oder } T > +123$$ dann liegt ein zweiseitiger Test vor. Kurz schreibt man dann auch meistens $$H_0 \\text{ wird verworfen, falls } |T| > 123$$ In dem beschriebenen Fall liegt eine Stichprobe $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ vor, welche aus einer Verteilung gezogen wurde. Es ist aber auch möglich, dass man zwei Stichproben $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ und $Y_1, \\dots, Y_m$ hat. Das ist z.B. bei Medikamententests häufig der Fall. Da will man wissen ob beide Stichproben aus der gleichen Verteilung stammen (also das Medikament nichts macht) oder eben nicht. $z$-Test Hypothesen: $H_0$: $\\mu = \\mu_0$ vs $H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0$ Testgröße: $T(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} (\\bar{x} - \\mu_0)}{\\sigma}$ Verteilung: $T \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $T \\leq \\Phi&#94;{-1}(\\alpha) = z_\\alpha$ Zweiseitiger Ein-Stichproben-$t$-Test Testgröße: $T(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} (\\bar{x} - \\mu_0)}{s}$ Verteilung: $T \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-1}$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $|T| \\geq t_{n-1; 1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ Einseitiger Ein-Stichproben-$t$-Test Testgröße: $T(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} (\\bar{x} - \\mu_0)}{s}$ Verteilung: $T \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n-1}$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $T \\geq t_{n-1; 1-\\alpha}$ Ein-Stichproben-Varianz-Test Hypothesen: $H_0: \\sigma&#94;2 = \\sigma_0&#94;2$ gegen $H_1: \\sigma&#94;2 > \\sigma_0&#94;2$ Testgröße: $\\chi&#94;2 := \\frac{(n-1)S&#94;2}{\\sigma_0&#94;2}$ Verteilung: $\\chi&#94;2 \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\chi_{n-1}&#94;2$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $\\chi&#94;2 \\geq \\chi&#94;2_{n-1;1-\\alpha}$ Gütefunktion Die Gütefunktion ist $g(\\vartheta) = P_\\vartheta(\\text{Test verwirft } H_0), \\quad \\vartheta \\in \\Theta$. Ist die Nullhypothese einelementig (also $H_0: \\vartheta = \\vartheta_0$), so gilt $g(\\vartheta_0) = \\alpha$. Ist die Alternative einelementig (also: $H_1: \\vartheta = \\vartheta_1$), so gilt $g(\\vartheta_1) = 1- \\text{Fehler 2. Art}$. Neyman-Pearson-Test ( NP-Test ) Sei $h_0(x) = \\prod_{i=1}&#94;n f(x, \\vartheta_0)$ und $h_1(x) = \\prod_{i=1}&#94;n f(x, \\vartheta_1)$. Testentscheid: Verwerfe $H_0$, falls $h_0(x) \\leq c h_1(x)$, wobei $c$ so gewählt wird, dass das Niveau $\\alpha$ eingehalten wird. Likelihood-Quotienten-Test Testgröße: $$\\Lambda = \\frac{\\sup_{\\vartheta \\in \\Theta} L_x (\\vartheta)}{\\sup_{\\vartheta \\in \\Theta_0} L_x (\\vartheta)}$$ Hypothesen: $H_0$: $\\vartheta \\in \\Theta_0$ vs $H_1$: $\\vartheta \\in \\Theta \\setminus \\Theta_0$ Verteilung: Ist der Schätzer konsistent, so gilt $$2 \\log(\\Lambda_n) \\sim \\chi_1&#94;2$$ Testentscheid: Verwerfe $H_0$, falls $\\Lambda > c$. Wähle $c$ so, dass Niveau $\\alpha$ eingehalten wird. Also: Verwerfe $H_0$, falls $2 \\log \\Lambda_n \\geq \\chi&#94;2_{1, 1-\\alpha}$ Approximativer Binomialtest Gegeben seien $X_1, \\dots, X_n \\sim Bin(1, p)$, $p$ unbekannt. Hypothesen: $H_0: p = p_0$ vs $H_1: p = p_1$ Testgröße: $T_n(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X} - p)}{\\sqrt{p (1-p)}}$ Verteilung: $T_n \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $T_n > z_{1-\\alpha}$ Kapitel 4: 2-Stichproben Vergleiche (NV) F-Test für den Varianzquotienten Gegeben sind zwei Stichproben $X_1, \\dots, X_m$ sowie $Y_1, \\dots, Y_n$ mit $X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma&#94;2)$ und $\\mathcal{N}(\\nu, \\tau&#94;2)$. Hypothesen: $H_0: \\sigma&#94;2 = \\tau&#94;2$ vs $H_1: \\sigma&#94;2 \\neq \\tau&#94;2$ Testgröße: $$Q_{m,n} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{m-1} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m {(X_i - \\bar{X}_m)}&#94;2}{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n {(Y_i - \\bar{Y}_n)}&#94;2}$$ Verteilung: $Q_{m,n} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F_{m-1, n-1}$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $Q_{m,n} \\leq F_{m-1,n-1;\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ oder $Q_{m,n} \\geq F_{m-1,n-1;1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ Kapitel 5: Lineare Regression Satz 5.4.1 Unter $H_0$ ist die Teststatistik $F = \\frac{(TSS - RSS)/(p-r)}{RSS/(n-p)}$ Fisher-verteilt mit $p-r$ Zähler- und $n-p$ Nenner-Freiheitsgraden. ANOVA-Tafel Freiheitsgrade Quadratsumme mittlere Quadratsumme Teststatistik Regression $k-1$ TSS - RSS $\\frac{TSS-RSS}{k-1}$ F = $\\frac{TSS-RSS/(k-1)}{RSS/(n-k)}$ Residuen $n-k$ RSS $\\frac{RSS}{n-k}$ Gesamt $n-1$ TSS $H_0$: $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_k$ $H_0$ verwerfen, wenn $F \\geq F_{k-1, n-k; 1- \\alpha}$. Kleinster-Quadrate-Schätzer Der Kleinste-Quadrate-Schätzer für das klassische lineares Modell $Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon$ lautet: $$\\hat{\\beta} = (X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1} X&#94;T Y$$ $$\\hat{Y} \\sim N_n(X \\beta, \\sigma&#94;2 H)$$ $$\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, (1-H_{ii}) \\sigma&#94;2)$$ Der übliche Schätzer für $\\sigma&#94;2$ ist $$\\hat{\\sigma}&#94;2 = \\frac{1}{n-p} \\| Y - \\hat{Y} \\|&#94;2$$ Die folgenden Sachen kann man alle in der Klausur aus obigen Angaben herleiten (vgl. math.SE ): Es gilt: $$\\hat{\\beta} \\sim N_p(\\beta, \\sigma&#94;2 (X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1})$$ $$\\hat{\\beta}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_i, \\sigma&#94;2 (X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1}_{i+1, i+1})$$ sowie $$(n-p)\\hat{\\sigma}&#94;2/\\sigma&#94;2 \\sim \\chi&#94;2_{n-p}$$ Schätzer für die Standardabweichung von $\\hat{\\beta}$: $$se(\\hat{\\beta}_i) = \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{{(X&#94;T X)}&#94;{-1}_{i,i}}$$ Kapitel 6: Varianz- und Kovarianz­analyse Modellannahmen der Varianzanalyse Das Rauschen ist unabhängig und jeweils $\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma&#94;2)$. Summenrestriktionen Es muss ein balanciertes Design ($n_1 = n_2 = \\dots = n_k$) vorliegen. Dann muss $$\\sum_{i=1}&#94;k \\alpha_i = 0$$ gelten. Das Modell ist $Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon$ mit Design-Matrix $$X = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& 0 & &0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & &\\vdots\\\\ \\vdots & 1 & 0 & &\\vdots\\\\ \\vdots & 0 & 1 & &\\vdots\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & 1 & & 0\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & 0 & & 1\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots &\\vdots\\\\ \\vdots & 0 & 0 & & 1\\\\ \\vdots & -1 & -1 & \\dots & -1\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots\\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & \\dots & -1\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$$ und Parametervektor $$\\beta := \\begin{pmatrix}\\mu\\\\\\alpha_2\\\\\\dots\\\\\\alpha_k\\end{pmatrix}$$ Bonferroni-Korrektur Es liegt eine Familie von $m$ Tests vor. Man macht eine globale Nullhypothese, dass alle Nullhypothesen gelten. Alle $m$ Test werden auf dem Niveau $\\frac{\\alpha}{m}$ durchgeführt, sodass insgesamt das Niveau $\\alpha$ erreicht wird. Bestimmtheitsmaß $R&#94;2$ $$R&#94;2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (y_i - \\bar{y}_i)}$$ Es gilt: $R&#94;2 \\in [0, 1]$ Ist die Kenntnis von $x$ wichtig für die Vorhersage von $y$, so ist das Bestimmtheitsmaß nahe bei 1. Globaler $F$-Test Hypothesen: $H_0$: $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_k$ vs $H_1: \\exists i, j: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j$ Testgröße: $F = \\frac{(TSS - RSS) / (k-1)}{RSS / (n-k)}$ Verteilung: $F \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} F_{k-1, n-k}$ Testentscheid: $H_0$ verwerfen, falls $F \\geq F_{k-1, n-k; 1 - \\alpha}$ Kapitel 7: Kategoriale Daten - Kapitel 8: Nicht­parametrische Verfahren Vorzeichen-Test für den Median Teste die Hypothese ob eine Größe $M$ den Mittelwert $\\mu$ hat gegen die Alternative $H_1$: $M \\neq \\mu$. Bilde die Prüfgröße $$S_n = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\mathbb{1}_{X_i > \\mu}$$ Falls $H_0$ gilt, dann ist $S_n \\sim Bin(n, 0.5)$ Lehne $H_0$ ab, wenn $S_n \\leq c$ oder $S_n \\geq n - c$.

R has its niche: Statistics (although I expect Python to replace R on the long run) R has a tutorial . In this introduction, one can also see the focus on statistics. Bad things about R The name. Try searching for \"R\" ... \"rlang\" seems to work, though. But it is close to \"erlang\", another language. This makes searching for answers harder than necessary. There seems to be no possibility to run an R script from console like python script.py . : This is simply wrong. If you edit the keyboard shortcuts (\"run all code\"), you can see it. But I have to say that it's pretty well-hidden ;-) (Thanks to Tariq for correcting me!) There seems to be no possibility to run an R script completely within rstudio. I've seen users who know R for several years pressing ctrl + enter for every single line to execute the script line by line. Indexing starts with 1 , not with 0 . Community R seems to have a pretty active community according to langpop.corger.nl ... however, not comparable with Python ( githut.info ). And they love forking repos. Why Python can replace R One thing mentioned all the time as a reason to use R are nice visualizations which are easy to create. Well, in Python there is matplotlib and seaborn (as well as ggplot , bokeh , pygal , geoplotlib , gleam , missingo , leather , ...). For example, the plot from above can be made with matplotlib like this: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- ur \"\"\" # Aufgabe 16 In einem Test wird die Nullhypothese, dass für eine bestimmte Altersgruppe mit n Personen die durchschnittliche Punktzahl θ bei einem Leistungstest 40 beträgt, gegen die Alternative, dass diese ungleich 40 ist, getestet.

The article is certainly not of high quality, but I want to keep it as a reminder for some of the problems I ran into and the solutions I've used. I've recently talked to my bachelors thesis advisers. A short reminder: I write a thesis about the recognition of handwritten mathematical symbols. As a practical part I implement everything on write-math.com . My advisers said me that I need at least 100 training examples per symbol. As I currently have about 1070 symbols in the database, including symbols like \\bat or \\Mundus . As they are extremely unlikely to be used in math mode, I will simply skip them. The more symbols I can skip, the less training symbols I need to get. So I want to skip as many as possible. I think \\up[greek letter] like \\updelta and \\Updelta are also rare. But my adviser doesn't think so. This means I need to prove it. One way to prove it is by looking at much data and counting. One of the biggest datasources for LaTeX is arXiv , a repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. Why parsing LaTeX is hard Special cases. Lots of them. At first you would think: Dude, it's only counting strings in documents. Is that really worth writing an article? Yes, it is. Just think about the many ways you can define your own commands (called macros): \\newcommand{[search]}{[replace]} \\newcommand{[search]} {[replace]} \\def[search]{[replace]} \\newcommand*{[search]}{[replace]} \\newenvironment ... Then remember that you can import files \\input{package} \\input package.sty \\include \\usepackage and weird commands like \\begin{filecontents*} . And even more weird self-defined ones: \\def\\be{\\begin{equation}} \\def\\ee{\\end{equation}} \\newcommand{\\beq}{\\begin{equation}} \\newcommand{\\eeq}{\\end{equation}} \\def\\bea{\\begin{eqnarray}} \\def\\eea{\\end{eqnarray}} \\newcommand\\beq{\\begin{equation}} \\newcommand\\eeq{\\end{equation}} \\newcommand\\beqa{\\begin{eqnarray}} \\newcommand\\eeqa{\\end{eqnarray}} \\def\\({\\left(} \\def\\){\\right)} \\def\\[{\\left[} \\def\\]{\\right]} \\def\\<{\\left\\langle} \\def\\>{\\right\\rangle} As some of these were quite common, sed and find saved me some work: find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\newcommand{\\\\beq}{\\\\begin{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\newcommand\\\\eeq{\\\\end{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\newcommand{\\\\eeq}{\\\\end{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\newcommand{\\\\be}{\\\\begin{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\newcommand{\\\\ee}{\\\\end{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\def\\\\ee{\\\\end{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\def\\\\be{\\\\begin{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 \\ sed -i 's/\\\\def\\\\ee{\\\\end{equation}}/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/g' What I currently don't check Commands with parameters: \\makeatletter \\def\\imod #1 { \\allowbreak\\mkern 10mu( { \\operator @font mod } \\,\\, #1) } \\makeatother Structure of arXiv arXiv uses Amazon S3 with the \"requester pays\" option.

Stanford: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP. The final project will involve training a complex recurrent neural network and applying it to a large scale NLP problem. On the model side we will cover word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as some very novel models involving a memory component. Through lectures and programming assignments students will learn the necessary engineering tricks for making neural networks work on practical problems. syllabus They provide YouTube videos and slides. The videos are simply recordings of the lecture, but in good quality. Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning Machine Learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data analysis today.

Review of 2016 This year was pretty awesome. I went to a summer school in Greifswald where I got to know a lot of nice people. I participated in a wind surfing and in a sailing course. I hiked the GR 20 , finished my first via ferrata ( Alpspitz-Ferrata ), went to the Salewa-Klettersteig and the Tegelberg Klettersteig near Füssen. In July, I got to know Bouldering and managed to finish the first Fb 6c - 7b routes. However, only routes up to 5c are always easy for me (see table with climbing grades and wiki article ). In December, I've got the chance to go to NIPS 2016 Here are some other mentionable facts: ML-KA is still active. I have 15 838 points on StackOverflow and reached 5.1 million people with my posts ( source ). I wrote 53 articles for this blog (including this one) in 2016. A couple of them might be interesting for a very specific audience ( SVMs , classifier comparison , machine learning glossary ). I've uploaded 835 files to Wikipedia Commons in 2016 ( source ). My uploads to Wikipedia Commons are about 3 GiB in total now. On commons, I made 4414 edits in total. Old year resolutions ✔ 05.02.2016: Sold my old vacuum cleaner ✔ 17.02.2016: Quit church ✔ 08.05.2016: Migrate Blog to Pelican ✔ 14.04.2016: Contact BSI, BKA, CCC and the car sellers and send them my paper in which I summarize current problems in car security. (Later, I found this . Coincidence?) ✔ 01.11.2016: I got rid of my old bed. ✔ 03.11.2016: I painted some walls in my appartment (not all, though). I failed to get all my stuff from my father to my place. However, most of it is here now. Also, I didn't find new slippers. Old year predictions Machine Learning and Technology Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8 layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30 layers. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition has networks with over 1000 layers. ✔ First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear. Twitter taught Microsoft's AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day , /r/howhot ✔ Machines will generate \"high\" resolution images of at least 256 × 256 pixels. StackGANs generate 256 px × 256 px images ✔ Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. See Towel Day , Google Translate Recording , Festival Recording ✗ ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to about 900 Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690 Euro). ✗ It only went up to 760 Euro. Solar Roadways will make some tiny advances. ✗ Very, very, tiny updates. About Me One of my papers will get cited at least 5 times. ✗ I will spend at least 2 weeks abroad. Done : My trip to Corsica was a bit longer than 2 weeks. Then 10 days in Barcelona. I will publish at leat 40 articles on my blog. Done : 53 articles. I will get a 90 days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is 43 days). Failed I will get 15 000 points on StackExchange (see StackExchange profile ) ✔ Politics The European Union will still exist and Britain will still be part of it (see Brexit ). Correct (Yes, they voted for Brexit. But currently they are still part of the EU. And I doubt they will really quit the EU.) Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the democrat candidate. I was right about this. The republican candidate will get president. Correct More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will happen. Correct Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016 ). False : Grüne and CDU. New year resolutions The plans for my new year are: [ ] Get all my stuff from my fathers apartment to my room. I've already packed most of it in boxes (In total: 1.00m (+0.30m?) × 0.39m × 0.60m by 4 boxes) [ ] Get new slippers [ ] Finish my masters degree [ ] Participate in a Flashmob [ ] Get comfortable with Orange Bouldering routes (5c-6c) and finish at least 5 harder ones (6c - 7b) [ ] Visit a country I haven't been to before. Finishing things I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash. ✔ Deleting several hundret E-mails. ✔ Clean up my smartphones TODO list. [ ] Clean up my notes. [ ] Clean up my Desktop / Download folder. [ ] Make Backup of Facebook ( tutorial ), Google+ and Gmail ( takeout ), Twitter ( tutorial ), WhatsApp ( tutorial ), Amazon, Banking. ✔ Push git stuff Predictions for 2017 Machine Learning and Technology Networks will not get deeper (currently: about 600 layers, max 2000 layers), but work about how to get the same accuracy with less parameters / FLOPs will be written. GANs will be able to create 1024px x 1024px images. An AI will play Star Craft and at least one nice video of it will be online. About Me I will publish at least two papers (one will be my masters thesis) I will finish my masters degree. I will publish at least 40 articles on my blog. I will get at least 20 000 points on StackOverflow (see StackExchange profile ) Politics The European Union will still exist and Britain will still be part of it, although somebody will be going in front of curt because of it (see Brexit ). German elections: 35% for CDU/CSU, 18% for SPD, 15% for AfD, 9% for Grüne, 9% Linke. Trump will not build a complete wall to Mexico.

It deals with the following kind of problems: You're given a set of states \\(\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) and a starting state \\(x_0 \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) . For every time step \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\) you have a set of possible actions, depending on your current state: $$\\mathcal{A}_k(x_k)$$ Depending on what your action and your current state is, the new state is $$P(x_k, a_k, x_{k+1}) \\in [0, 1]$$ So the transition from state \\(x_k\\) to state \\(x_{k+1}\\) with action \\(a_k\\) is stochastic. For some states \\(x_k\\) , actions \\(a_k\\) at time \\(k\\) , you receive rewards: $$r_k(x_k, a_k) \\in \\mathbb{R}$$ Your goal is to maximize $$\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_{k=0}&#94;\\infty \\gamma&#94;k \\cdot r_k(x_k, a_k))$$ where \\(\\gamma in (0, 1)\\) is a discounting factor which makes sure we don't get infinite rewards. \\(\\gamma = 0.99\\) is a typical choice. Applications This very general problem description can be applied in almost any scenario: Learning automatically to play games Learning to control robots Why RL is difficult Credit assignment: In chess, you only get a reward (positiv or negative) at the end of the game. How to you tell which move was good or bad? Exploration vs. exploitation : When should you stick to what you know and when should you try something new? State equivalence: Typically, your state is very high-dimensional. For example when learning very old computer games from raw pixels you have $$210 \\cdot 160 \\cdot 3 = 100800$$ dimensions in your feature vector. But the relevant game states might be much less. Approaches A policy network gets the state as input and outputs the action. It learns by executing many episodes (e.g. a complete game; from start until you reach a final state or at least a state with reward) and labels all actions before with the received reward. There might be many which were good even in a lost game, but in average you expect to punish bad decisions and encourage good decisions.

Live Demos and Websites Quickdraw Quickdraw is a program which tries to guess what you drew. However, it is difficult to check if they really apply machine learning, because it tells you what to draw and then tries to recognize it. I had to draw a piano, a floor lamp, a chandelier, a suitcase, a candle and a lipstick each in under 20 seconds. It looks very much like an attempt to get lots of training data.

Publications Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled The input of CNNs for image classification can be manipulated in two ways: An image, on which a human does not recognize anything (e.g. white noise) gets a high score for some object class. An image on which a human is certain to recognize one class (e.g. \"cat\") is manipulated in a way that the CNN classifies with high certainty something different (e.g. \"factory\").

This year, about 6000 people attended it. My friend Marvin and me were supported by Begabtenstiftung Informatik Karlsruhe . The complete program can be found in the Conference Book , but I would like to point out some of my highlights. Hot Topics To get an idea what NIPS 2016 was about, I generated a word cloud from the titles of the accepted papers: The organization team made something similar, but they had access to the information how the papers were tagged: (Image source: www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de ) The top 10 topics were: 01: Deep Learning or Neural Networks 42: (Application) Computer Vision 02: Large Scale Learning and Big Data 05: Learning Theory 53: (Other) Optimization 08: Sparsity and Feature Selection 51: (Other) Classification 03: Convex Optimization 54: (Other) Probabilistic Models and Methods 56: (Other) Unsupervised Learning Methods I would say the top five hot topics (first is hottest) are: GANs Reinforcment Learning: Look for \"bandit\" in the paper titles unsupervised learning alternative ways to train DNNs reducing the need for data (transfer learning, domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning) GANs Generative Adverserial Networks (short: GANs) were one hot topic at NIPS. The idea is to train two networks: A generator \\(G\\) and a discriminator \\(D\\) . The generator creates content (e.g. images) and the discriminator has to decide if the content is of the natural distribution (the training set) or made by the generator. An introduction can be found at blog.evjang.com Noteworthy papers and ideas are: Learning What and Where to Draw InfoGAN : Get more control about properties of the generated content.

It seems like the combination of those two is called \"bayesian deep learning\". If you look for the keyword \"variational\" it seems to belong in this category. I don't really know this area, so I leav it to Eric Jang to point out important papers. Nut's and Bolts of ML Andrew Ng gave a talk in which he summarized what he thinks are some of the most important topics when training machine learning systems. Most of it is probably also in his book Machine Learning Yearning or in his Coursera course . Here are some of the things he talked about: When you design a speech recognition system, you can measure 3 types of errors: Human error, training set error and test set error. The difference between the human error and the training error is \"avoidable error\" (bias), the difference between training and test error is \"variance\". Human level performance is ambiguous: In a medical application, is an amateur, a doctor, an experienced doctor or a team of (experienced) doctors the \"human level performance\"?

And they might have had a significant influence in the last US election. Now people are demanding from Facebook to \"do something\" against the spread of Fake news. Facebook is giving users the possibility to report fake news. If enough people reported a link as fake news, a human reviewer fact-checks it. If the reviewer decides it is fake, then users get warned before they view such content. [ Ohl16 ] However, this approach has many problems: Speed: Facebook might have problems to identify fake news before it gets viral Quality: What if the reviewers make mistakes? Power: Do we want to rely on Facebook for this? I argue that fake news is just a symptom of an underlying problem which isn't addressed by anybody so far: News organizations don't give checkable sources and we don't demand it. What we should do Be skeptical. Ask for sources. Ask: \"Why should I trust you?\" The Author The first and most important part is probably the author of an article. If an article does not have an author, it is probably fake. Even if there is a name, it might be imaginary. So we need a way to validate it. One way to do that is the following procedure: Author pages : Authors should have webpages. This does not necessarily mean they host it; there are plenty of services where you can put stuff about yourself online. For researchers, there is ORCiD , for journalists LinkedIn might be a reasonable choice. Links to author pages : The name of the author in a news article should link to the author page. Backlinks : The author page has to contain a link to every single article. Microformats : This is a technical bit. Microformats like hnews allow semantic tagging of content. This means we can write programs to extract meaning from webpages. For example, it is possible to tag which part of the page contains the name of the author. Or to make clear to simple programs that the page is a news page. This kind of semantic tagging makes it possible to automatically check if the minimal quality / trust criteria are met. How does this help? Well, first of all you would know not only one article of the author, but all articles of the author. Second, the author wants to make himself as trustworthy as possible. In networks like LinkedIn, this might be possible by having endorsements or connections which seem trustworthy. Demand Sources and Details This one is for the \"reputable\" news organizations. Most newspapers barely give any references / sources for statements in their articles. As an example, I had a look at the first article of the Washington post ( The oil and gas industry is quickly amassing power in Trump's Washington ). Lets see which claims they make for which I would expect a source: After eight years of being banished and sometimes vilified by the Obama administration ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson is Trump's nominee to be secretary of state \"It feels like the grizzly bear in ‘The Revenant' has been suddenly pulled off our chest,\" said Luke Popovich George H.W. Bush, who co-founded and ran Zapata Oil \"I think there's a level to which the puppeteers have become the actors, a change unprecedented in its breadth,\" said Dan Becker Those are only the first few where I think sources should be added. It is not enough to say \"said Luke Popovich\". In this case I'm not sure if they spoke themselves with Luke Popovich (then I'd expect a note that he was interviewed by one of the authors) or if it was a public statement. Also: When exactly did he say so? In this case it might not be too important, but there might be many where it is. Demanding sources as well as details like when a statement was made by whom and how or in which context is crucial. By the way, we should not only ask for sources when journalists or newspapers make statements. Also when politicians do so. Just like Trevor Noah suggest to adapt to Donald Trump's Lies . Build a Journalists Network Currently, it is harder than necessary to check the reputation of a journalist. I suggest we should built a web service which allows journalists and news organizations to create public profiles. News organizations can say who they currently trust and journalists can do so as well. Probably only for certain topics such as computer science , middle east , economy ... Every journalist can add articles to their profile. The articles have to contain a link to the same page to make sure they don't claim credit for something they don't deserve it for. Every news article has its own page. The page allows comments / clarifications to be made as well as adding links to related articles. Everybody can register, endorse journalists / articles and add friends. By this network, a trust score is calculated. For example, PageRank or Matrix completion algorithms could be used to complete the trustworthiness which you didn't directly assign. Relation to Fake News You might wonder how this is related to fake news. Well, imagine if journalists would add their sources to every statement. Imagine you could check an authors reputation as easy as I described it. Do you really think it would be that simple to create blatantly fake news as we have it nowadays? No. We would look at it, miss the sources and close the news. Probably within seconds. See also What I described in this article is a long-term solution for the problem of lies and propaganda.

The plain and simple answer is: Yes. I do like watching lectures on YouTube more than attending them. Let me elaborate on this. Side note: When I write YouTube in the following, I'm not limiting the statements on this particular platform. I mean any professional video streaming website. A very good alternative is Vimeo, for example. Reasons for providing online lectures Schedules Lectures are typically only offered every second semester. For me, most interesting lectures are in the winter semester. This means I have a lot of overlapping lectures. And never forget that there are some days when you're ill. If a lecture is on YouTube, you can simply watch it whenever you have time. Rate of Words People speak very slow. You are able to listen to at least double the speed in which they are able to talk. Even faster, if they need to write at the same time. On YouTube, you can play any video in double speed. Just try it yourself: For 15 lectures of 1.5 hours each, this means I waste over 11 hours. Volume For some lectures, the lecturer is much too loud for me. It is hard to focus on new concepts if you're thinking about just going to the back of the room. At the same time, some lecturers could speak up a bit. This really depends on where you sit. Of course, depending on the lecturer, the room and your ears you could choose your seat. However, you usually also need to see the blackboard. So in case your eyes are not so good either, this might not be so easy. On YouTube, you just turn the volume up or down to your personal preference. Rate of Progress per day Although people speak slow, some lecturers make progress very fast. For some statements, you need time to think about it. Although I could hear the statement much faster, after it was said I need a pause to process it. It is impossible to get those pauses right if more than a single student is in the room. Everybody has different previous knowledge. And even if two students had exactly the same lectures before, one might have an easier time understanding a new concept than another. On YouTube, you can simply pause the video. In lectures, you have to repeat it afterwards or simply ignore the fact that you didn't completely understand it. Rate of Progress per semester If I'm really interested in something, I can spend a lot of time with that topic. It doesn't feel natural to me to stop, just because 1.5 hours are over. Availability Lectures are about three months, then you have an exam. For most students and lectures, that's it. They will never come back to most things they've learned. However, sometimes you need something you know you had in a lecture. If it was a lecture which is available on YouTube, you can simply search for it. In case the lecture has a good book or you have lecture notes, this might also work with \"live lectures\". However, usually people tend to say things in a very different way than how they would write it. Sometimes it just happens that you know that you understood a concept, but you need a refresher on it. This might work much faster if it is available via YouTube. Distractions Lectures are typically in lecture rooms. A lot of people are there. Some are playing on their smartphones, some come late, others bounce their legs. The other students are just distracting. They are not necessary at this point . Also, there are internal distractions: I might be hungry or sleepy. I can't just take a 5 minute nap in the lecture. I also feel like I shouldn't just eat in the lecture as it might distract fellow students. In contrast, when I watch lectures from udacity or coursera , I'm in a place where I can fully concentrate. If I need a break to sleep, eat or think about something else, I can do so. Correctness It is not possible to get everything always right. Lecturers will sometimes say things in a wrong way or in a way which is misleading. If the lectures are split up into small pieces, they can re-make the part which was wrong. Or at least put a text overlay there to mention the mistake. As many students over the years will listen to the lectures, it seems to be more likely that errors will be spotted and noted. Interactivity It is not really possible to make a lecture interactive. Yes, there are good options like socrative where you can allow students to simply post an answer anonymously. But compare that to multiple choice in YouTube videos where students can thinks as long as they want about a problem. Or even free answers, where you allow the student to check for themselves if they got it right, wrong or if they need a clarification. I really don't like questions in lectures. Either they are too easy and I am bugged by that or wondering if I got something really wrong. Or they are too hard and I would need more than the usual 5 seconds to think about the question. Or I just was thinking about something else and I need some more context to understand the question / answer in the expected way. What would I do with a YouTube video if I just lost the context? I would skip back a minute. Open Knowledge Most German universities are heavily funded by the public. There is no good reason to not make the content created by tax payers available to all tax payers. Reasons against providing online lectures Creating an online lecture is time intensive. The video has to be made, cut and uploaded. In case of errors, they should be fixed. Ideally, the video should be cut into small sections or at least an index should be created (see Videos of Prof. Henze , for example. Every lecture has a lot of links to parts within the video to make the content more accessible) So time / money is a valid reason why lectures are not available online. Pseudo-reasons against online lectures Lecture halls would be empty So what? If we really don't need them (which I really doubt), we could use them for something else. For example, for paper discussion groups such as the one I organized for machine learning (see ML-KA/PDG ). Or we could have more small rooms for learning in silence / in groups. No Discussion This is plain wrong. A professional video portal always has a comment section. So it is possible to have a discussion. Ideally, online lectures would be hosted on a platform which is suitable for lectures. This means it should have a Q&A part directly linked to lectures where students can ask questions and answer them. Quite similar to StackOverflow . I think I have seen that on coursera. Sebastian Thrun said students answered the questions of other students so fast, that he only watched the questions and answers popping up. Only in rare cases he had to answer questions or correct a wrong answer. Students don't get to know each other People don't get to know each other in lecture halls. Most try to have at least one empty seat between themselves and students they don't know. If there are waiting times, at least half of the students look at their smartphones. Students get to know each other in leisure time activities, Facebook groups for the different lectures, in search of other students for exam preparation (via e-mail lists and Facebook groups) or via student groups like my machine learning group ML-KA .

The aim is to keep things simple and brief, not to explain the terms in full detail. Active Learning The algorithm gives a pattern and asks for a label. Backpropagation A clever implementation of gradient descent for neural networks. Bias Bias is a concept which describes a systematic error. A classifier with a high bias tends to give one answer more often, no matter what the input is. This concept is relatied to variance and well described with the images here . BLSTM , BiLSTM Bidirectional long short-term memory (see paper and poster ). Co-Training A form of semi-supervised learning. Two independant classifiers are trained on different labeled datasets. The classifiers are applied to the unlabeled data. Data with high confidence will be added to the other classifiers data. Collaborative Filtering You have users and items which are rated. No user rated everything. You want to fill the gaps (see article ). Computer Vision The academic discipline which deals with how to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Common tasks include image classifiction, semantic segmentation, detection and localization. Curriculum learning A method for pretraining. First optimize a smoothed objective and gradually consider less smoothing. So a curriculum is a sequence of training criteria. One might show gradually more difficult training examples. See Curriculum Learning by Benigo, Louradour, Collobert and Weston for details. Curse of dimensionality Various problems of high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional spaces. High-dimensional often means several 100 dimensions. See also: Average Distance of Points DCGAN ( Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Networks ) TODO DCIGN ( Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphic Network ) TODO DCNN ( Doubly Convolutional Neural Network ) Introduced in this paper ( summary ). Note Some people also call Deep Convolutional Neural Networks DCNNs. DNN Deep Neural Network. The meaning of \"deep\" differs. Sometimes it means at least one hidden layer, sometimes it means at least 12 hidden layers. Domain adaptation A model is trained on dataset $A$. How does it have to be changed to work on dataset $B$? Detection in Computer Vision ( Object detection ) Object detection in an image is a computer vision task. The input is an image and the output is a list with rectangles which contain objects of the given type. Face detection is one well-studied example. A photo could contain no face or hundrets of them. The rectangles can overlap. Deep Learning Buzzword. The meaning depends on who you ask / in which year you asked. Sometimes it means multi-layer perceptrons with more than $N$ layers (some say $N=2$ is already deep learning, others want N>20 or nowadays $N>100$). Discriminative Model The model gives a conditional probability of the classes $k$, given the feature vector $x$: $P(k | x)$. This kind of model is often used for prediction. FC7-Features Features of an image which was run through a trained neural network. AlexNet called the last fully connected layer FC7. However, FC7 features are not necessarily created by AlexNet. FMLLR Feature-Space Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression Feature Map A feature map is the result of a single filter of a convolutional layer being applied. So it is the activation of that filter over the given input. Fine-tuning See pre-training GMM Gaussian Mixture Model GEMM ( GEneral Matrix to Matrix Multiplication ) General Matrix to Matrix Multiplication is the problem of calculating the result of $C = A \\cdot B$ with $A \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times m}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{m \\times k}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times k}$. Generative model The model gives the relationship of variables: $P(x, y)$. This kind of model can be used for prediction, too. Gradient Descent An iterative optimization algorithm for differentiable functions. HMM Hidden Markov Model i-vector speaker identity vector. See Front-End Factor Analysis for Speaker Verification . MANN Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (see Blog post ) Machine Vision Computer vision applied for industrial applications. Matrix Completion See collaborative filtering . MLLR Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression MMD ( Maximum Mean Descrepancy ) MMD is a measure of the difference between a distribution $P$ and a distribution $Q$: $$MMD(F, p, q) = sup_{f \\in F} (\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p} [f(x)] - \\mathbb{E}_{y \\sim q} [f(y)])$$ Multi-Task learning Train a model which does multiple tasks at the same time, e.g. segmentation and detection (see MultiNet ). NEAT Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (see Blogpost ). Object recognition Classification on images. The task is to decide in which class a given image falls, judging by the content. This can be cat, dog, plane or similar. One-Shot learning Learn only with one or very few examples per class. See One-Shot Learning of Object Categories . Optical Flow Optical flow is defined for two images. It describes how the points in one image moved when switching to the second image. PCA Principal component analysis (short: PCA) is a linear transformation which projects $n$ points $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times s}$ with $s$ features each on a hyperplane in such a way that the projection error is minimal. Hence it is an unsupervised method for feature reduction. It simply works by finding a matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{s \\times m}$, where $m \\leq s$ can be chosen as small as desired. Pre-training You have machine learning model $m$. Pre-training : You have a dataset $A$ on which you train $m$. You have a dataset $B$. Before you start training the model, you initialize some of the parameters of $m$ with the model which is trained on $A$. Fine-tuning : You train $m$ on $B$. Regularization Regularization are techniques to make the fitted function smoother. This helps to prevent overfitting. Examples: L1, L2, Dropout, Weight Decay in Neural Networks. Parameter $C$ in SVMs. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcment learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which focuses on the question how to find actions which lead to higher rewards. See German lecture notes . Self-Learning One form of semi-supervised learning, where you train an initial system on the labeled data, then label the unlabeled data where the classifier is 'sure enough'. After that, you train a new system on all data and re-label the unlabeled data. This is iterated. Semi-supervised learning Some training data has labels, but most has no labels. Supervised learning All training data has labels. Spatial Pyramid Pooling ( SPP ) SPP is the idea of dividing the image into a grid with a fixed number of cells and a variable size, depending on the input. Each cell computes one feature and hence leads to a fixed-size representation of a variable-sized input. See paper and summary TF-IDF TF-IDF (short for Term frequency–inverse document frequency) is a measure that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. Transductive learning label unlabeled data (the aim here is NOT to find a hypothesis) Unsupervised learning No training data has labels. VC-Dimension A theoretical natural number assigned to any classifier. The higher the VC dimension of a classifier, the more situations it is able to capture (see longer explanation , german explanation ). VLAD Vector of Locally Aligned Descriptors VTLN vocal tract length normalization WRN Wide residual network Zero-Shot learning Learning to predict classes, of which no example has been seen during training. For example, Flicker gets several new tags each day and they want to predict tags for new images. One idea is to use WordNet and ImageNet to generate a common embedding. This way, new words of WordNet could already have an embedding and thus new images categories could also automatically be classified the right way.

At least not in detail. One just gets told that points are farer away from each other in high dimensional spaces. Maximum minimal distance One approach to this is to calculate the maximum minimal distance of \\(k\\) points in \\([0, 1]&#94;n\\) . So you try to place \\(k\\) points in such a way, that the minimum over the pairwise distances of those \\(k\\) points is maximal. Let's call this \\(\\alpha(n, k)\\) . However, it is not easily possible to calculate \\(\\alpha(n, k)\\) for arbitrary \\(n > 2\\) and \\(k > 2\\) (see link ). But the special case \\(k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2&#94;n\\) is easy: \\(\\alpha(n, 2) = \\sqrt{n}\\) \\(\\alpha(n, 2&#94;n) = 1\\) So you can see that two points get can be farer apart in higher dimensions and that it needs much more points in higher dimensions to force at least two of them to have distance 1. Average distance Another approach is to calculate the average distance of \\(k\\) uniformly randomly sampled points in \\([0, 1]&#94;n\\) . Let's call it \\(\\beta(n, k)\\) . One first insight is that \\(\\beta(n, k) = \\beta(n, j)\\) for and \\(k, j \\geq 2\\) . Hence we will only use \\(\\beta(n)\\) in the following. It is possible to calculate this, but it is rather tedious ( link ). Just two calculated solutions for \\(k=2\\) points: \\(\\beta(1) = \\frac{1}{3}\\) \\(\\beta(2) = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}+5\\operatorname{arcsinh}(1)}{15}=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}+5\\log(1+\\sqrt{2})}{15} \\approx 0.52140543316472\\ldots\\) However, it is pretty easy to simulate it. Density of Hypercubes One interesting question is how much of the \\(n\\) -dimensional hypercube can be filled by one inscribed \\(n\\) -dimensional hyperball. The volume of an \\(n\\) -dimensional hypercube is \\(V_C(a) = a&#94;n\\) where \\(a\\) is the cubes side length. So for 1 dimension it is \\(a\\) , for 2 dimensions (a square) it is \\(a&#94;2\\) , for 3 dimensions it is \\(a&#94;3\\) (a cube). The volume of an \\(n\\) -dimensional ball is $$V_S(r) = r&#94;n \\frac{\\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\Gamma (\\frac{n}{2} + 1)}$$ Source: Wikipedia So for 1 dimension it is \\(r \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\Gamma(1.5)} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{0.5 \\Gamma(0.5)} = 2r\\) , for 2 dimensions it is \\(r&#94;2 \\frac{\\pi}{\\Gamma (2)} = r&#94;2 \\frac{\\pi}{\\Gamma (1)} = r&#94;2 \\pi\\) and for 3 dimensions it is \\(r&#94;3 \\frac{\\pi&#94;{3/2}}{\\Gamma (\\frac{5}{2})} = r&#94;3 \\frac{\\pi&#94;{3/2}}{1.5 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot \\Gamma (\\frac{1}{2})} = r&#94;3 \\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{3}{4}}\\) . This means the percentage of space of a unit hypercube which can be filled by the biggest inscribed hyperball is $$ \\begin{align} \\frac{V_S(0.5)}{V_C(1)} &= \\frac{r&#94;n \\frac{\\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\Gamma (\\frac{n}{2} + 1)}}{1} \\\\ &= \\frac{0.5&#94;n \\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\Gamma (\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} \\\\ &= \\frac{0.5&#94;n \\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot \\Gamma (\\frac{n}{2})} \\\\ &= \\frac{0.5&#94;n \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\pi&#94;{n/2}}{n \\cdot \\frac{2 \\frac{n}{2}!}{n}} \\\\ &= \\frac{0.5&#94;n \\cdot \\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\frac{n}{2}!} \\end{align} $$ You can see that this term goes to 0 with increasing dimension. This means most of the volume is not in the center, but in the edges of the \\(n\\) dimensional hypercube. It also means that \\(k\\) nearest neighbors with Euclidean Distance measure will need enormously large spheres to get to the next neighbours. Average angle One interesting question is how the average angle between two points (and the origin) changes with higher dimensions. Suppose all points are in the \\([-1, 1]&#94;n\\) hypercube. I thought about this for a while and came to the conclusion that it should be 90° in average due to symmetry. No matter how high the dimension is. A short experiment confirms that: #!/usr/bin/env python from scipy import spatial import numpy as np import seaborn as sns def cosine_dist ( p1 , p2 ): \"\"\" Calculate the cosine distance between to points in R&#94;n. Examples -------- >>> cosine_dist([1, 0], [0, 1]) 90.0 >>> cosine_dist([1, 0], [2, 0]) 0.0 >>> cosine_dist([1, 0], [-1, 0]) 180.0 \"\"\" ang = 1 - spatial . distance . cosine ( p1 , p2 ) if not ( - 1 <= ang <= 1 ): if ang >= 1 : return 0 if ang <= - 1 : return 180 return np . degrees ( np . arccos ( ang )) def get_angles ( n , num_points = 100 ): \"\"\"Get angles of random points in n-dimensional unit hypercube.\"\"\" points = 2 * np . random . rand ( num_points , n ) - 1 angles = [] for p1 in points : for p2 in points : angles . append ( cosine_dist ( p1 , p2 )) return angles if __name__ == \"__main__\" : import doctest doctest . testmod () for n in [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 ]: angles = get_angles ( n ) print ( \"{:>5} dim: {:0.4f} avg angle\" . format ( n , sum ( angles ) / len ( angles ))) sns . distplot ( angles , kde = False , rug = False ) sns . plt . show () Also interesting: How does the distribution of angles change? The plots generated by the code from above: Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 1D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 2D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 3D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 4D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 10D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 100D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 1000D Distribution of angles between randomly placed points in 10000D Hence I guess the cosine distance is not a good measure in high-dimensional spaces. (One should measure this for non-random points to get more certain about it.) Empirical results #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\" Get the empirical statements about the distance of two points in [0, 1]&#94;n. The points are uniformly randomly sampled. \"\"\" import numpy.random def random_points_dist ( n ): \"\"\"Get the distance of one sample of 2 points in [0, 1]&#94;n.\"\"\" assert n >= 1 points = [] for _ in range ( 2 ): p = numpy . random . rand ( n ) points . append ( p ) return numpy . linalg . norm ( points [ 0 ] - points [ 1 ]) def beta ( n ): \"\"\"Calculate the average distance of 2 points in [0, 1]&#94;n.\"\"\" sum_ = 0.0 count_ = 10 ** 6 less_one = 0 max_d = 0 for _ in range ( count_ ): dist = random_points_dist ( n ) if dist < 1.0 : less_one += 1 max_d = max ( max_d , dist ) sum_ += dist return ( sum_ / count_ , float ( less_one ) / count_ , max_d ) for n in [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 100 , 1000 ]: avg_dist , pr , max_d = beta ( n ) tmp = ( \"beta(n= %i ) = %0.4f ; \" % ( n , avg_dist )) print ( \" %s Pr(d(p1, p2) < 1) = %0.4f ; alpha(n= %i , 2) = %0.4f \" % ( tmp , pr , n , max_d )) One can easily see that points get spaced much farer away in average the higher the dimension \\(n\\) is. Now lets try to calculate the probability that two points in the unit hypercube have a distance of less than 1. Here are a couple of results. Just a short reminder: \\(\\alpha(n, 2)\\) is the maximum distance two points can have in a unit cube in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) \\(\\beta(n)\\) is the average distance of two points in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) \\(Pr(d(p_1, p_2) < 1)\\) is the probability, that two uniformly randomly placed points have a distance of less than 1 in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) \\(V_S(0.5)/V_C(1)\\) is the amount a unit ball can fill a unit cube $n$ $\\alpha(n, 2)$ $\\beta(n)$ $Pr(d(p_1, p_2) < 1)$ $V_S(0.5)/V_C(1)$ 1 0.9994 0.3332 1.0000 1 2 1.3797 0.5211 0.9749 0.7854 3 1.6116 0.6616 0.9100 0.5236 4 1.8130 0.7776 0.8066 0.3084 5 1.8645 0.8786 0.6787 0.1645 6 1.9659 0.9693 0.5419 0.0807 7 2.0891 1.0515 0.4125 0.0369 8 2.1513 1.1280 0.3006 0.0159 9 2.2888 1.2002 0.2096 0.0064 10 2.3327 1.2671 0.1411 0.0025 100 5.2152 4.0753 0.0000 $\\approx 10&#94;{-70}$ 1000 14.0719 12.9073 0.0000 $\\approx 10&#94;{-1187}$ 10000 41.9675 40.8245 0.0000 $\\approx 10&#94;{-16851}$ $n$ ? $\\approx 0.41 \\cdot \\sqrt{n}$ ? $\\frac{0.5&#94;n \\cdot \\pi&#94;{n/2}}{\\frac{n}{2}!}$ You can easily see that the average distance of two points gets less and less different from the maximal distance of two points.

Ein Ansatz ist, zu versuchen \"Gesichtsfarbe\" zu erkennen. Die Modellierung kann mit Histogrammen erfolgen. Datensätze: ECU face detection database ECU face skin detection database MIT and CMU frontal face database Chromatic Color Spaces Nur zweidimensional (HS von HSV, UV von YUV, normalized rg von RGB). Soll robuster für die Erkennung von Hautfarbe sein. Histogram Backprojection Man geht für die Trainingsbeispiele alle Hautfarbe-Pixel durch. Bekommt man nun ein neues Bild, so geht man für dieses Bild jeden Pixel durch. Die Ausgabe ist ein Graustufenbild selber Größe, wo die Pixelfarbe die Anzahl der Hautfarbenen Pixel dieser Farbe ist. Histogram Matching Erstelle ein Histogram für Hautfarbe. Um ein neues Bild zu klassifizieren, bildet man Ausschnitte für das Bild. Für jeden Ausschnitt vergleicht man das Histogram des Ausschnitts mit dem Hautfarbe-Histogram. Dazu können folgende Metriken verwendet werden: Battacharya distance Histogram intersection Earth-movers distance Histogram equalization This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values. (Source: Wikipedia) The intensity values of the image are modified in such a way that the histogram is flattened. It roughly works like this: Let $p(x_i) = \\frac{n_i}{n}$ be the probability of a pixel having level $i$. Let $c(i) = \\sum_{j=0}&#94;i p(x_j)$ be the cumulative distribution. Find transformation $T$ such that the cumulative distribution $y = T(x)$ is linear. Image normalization Normalization is a process that changes the range of pixel intensity values. Applications include photographs with poor contrast due to glare, for example. Normalization is sometimes called contrast stretching or histogram stretching. (Source: Wikpedia) ROC Die ROC-Kurve misst die Abwägung zwischen True-Positve Rate ($\\frac{TP}{Pos}$, y-Achse) und False Positive Rate (\\frac{FP}{Neg}, x-Achse). Intersection over Union ( IoU ) Siehe StackExchange Haar-like features Based on Haar wavelets as features. Developed by Viola and Jones. A Haar-like feature considers adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window, sums up the pixel intensities in each region and calculates the difference between these sums. Can be computed efficiently by using integral images. AdaBoost TODO Face Recognition Alignment: Works only with \"nice\" images (no occlusion, high resolution) Eyes are hard Computationally intensive (not suitable for real time applications) Face Recognition Face recognition has 4 main tasks: Face detection : Given an image, draw a rectangle around every face Face alignment : Transform a face to be in a canonical pose Face representation : Find a representation of a face which is suitable for follow-up tasks (small size, computationally cheap to compare, invariant to irrelevant changes) Face verification : Images of two faces are given. Decide if it is the same person or not. The face verification task is sometimes (more simply) a face classification task (given a face, decide which of a fixed set of people it is).

A feed forward network is essentially only a directed acyclic graph. To make things simpler, lets just think about multilayer perceptrons. This means we only have connections between neighboring layers (and we have layers). Terms A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a finite graph \\(G = (V, E)\\) with vertices \\(V\\) and edges \\(E \\subseteq V \\times V\\) where no cycle can be found. A cycle is a set of edges \\(e_1, \\dots, e_n\\) such that \\(e_i = (v_i, v_{i+1})\\) with \\(e_n = (v_n, v_1)\\) . Iteration Now, what does it mean to iterate over the graphs? One can iterate over all natural numbers like this: i = 1 while True : print ( i ) i += 1 Resulting in the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\) which is guaranteed to reach any natural number \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) at some point. Similar, one can iterate over \\(\\mathbb{Q}_0&#94;+\\) : x = 0 y = 0 while True : if x > 0 : y += 1 x -= 1 else : x = y y = 1 print ( x / y ) this is the pattern in which the numbers are generated: Iterate over $\\mathbb{Q}_0&#94;+$ Graph iteration There are finitely many directed graphs \\(G = (V, E)\\) with \\(E \\subseteq V \\times V\\) with \\(n = |V|\\) nodes. So if one wanted to iterate over all of them, one could iterate over all graphs with \\(n=1\\) node (only one graph), then over all graphs with two nodes, ... At this point, it should be obvious that it is possible. However, how can we iterate over the structures without unnecessary duplication? How can we take into account that we also need connected graphs with a fixed size for the first layer and a fixed size for the last layer? Similar to the iteration over \\(\\mathbb{Q}_0&#94;+\\) , you first generate all MLPs with exactly one neuron. Then all MLPs with exactly two neurons, ...

Anyway, this made me wonder how much internet traffic I need. So I started recording it with vnstat . How to measure Install vnstat and vnstati : $ sudo apt-get install vnstat vnstati Then execute $ ip link 1 : lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1 link/loopback 00 :00:00:00:00:00 brd 00 :00:00:00:00:00 2 : enp0s31f6: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000 link/ether 98 :76:54:32:10:45 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 3 : wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000 link/ether 12 :34:56:78:90:ab brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to find your network interface. In my case, it is wlp3s0 . In most cases, it will be wlan0 or eth0 if you use a cable. I was mainly interested in WLAN. In my case, this is the interface wlp3s0 . Now I have to enable monitoring of that interface: $ vnstat -u -i wlp3s0 To get the nice images, you have to execute the following code (with your network interface). It will create a summary.png image: $ vnstati -vs -i wlp3s0 -o ~/summary.png Internet traffic of August Results To interpret the following, you should know that rx is the received traffic and tx is the transferred traffic. General I was not at home most of August, so the results you see in the image above might be different than usually. So lets get a summary for this year: $ vnstati -vs -m -i wlp3s0 -o ~/summary.png Internet traffic of May, June, July, August Now you have to realize that I am only recording my notebook. I have a tablet and a smartphone, too. I also only recorded WLAN, but I use the cable when I want to download / upload a lot. Also, my connection is not so fast. This means when I watch videos, I usually don't watch them in HD (although my computer would be awesome for that). So 50 GB to 70 GB download and about 5 GB to 6 GB upload might be a conservative estimate of what I need. Watching News Watching the German 20 o'clock news (15 minutes on tagesschau.de) is about 200 MiB rx and about 3 MiB tx.

Es gibt Kurse und Abendvorträge zu welchen man kommen muss, sowie einiges an Freizeitprogramm das durch die Stipendiaten organisiert wird. Sommerakademien sind eine wunderbare Möglichkeit neue Menschen kennen zu lernen und Fähigkeiten in Gebieten aufzubauen welche nicht die eigene Fachrichtung sind. Oder auch neue Personen kennen zu lernen, die an der eigenen Fachrichtung interessiert sind. Ryck bei Greifswald Es gibt einige Standorte, an denen immer wieder Sommerakademien statt finden. Greifswald ist einer davon. Dieser Artikel ist für Stipendiaten welche noch nie auf einer Sommerakademie waren oder welche sich über Besonderheiten von Greifswald informieren wollen. Da die Kurse immer unterschiedlich sind, werde ich dazu nichts schreiben. Anfahrt Die meisten werden mit der Bahn zum Bahnhof Greifswald fahren. Von dort kann man mit Linie 2 zur Haltestelle \"Wieck Brücke\" fahren. Dann sind es noch ca. 100 m an der Ryck (ein Fluss welcher in die Ostsee mündet) entlang zum MaJuWi. Das MaJuWi ist auf der rechten Seite, auf der Linken hat man den Fluss. Tipp: Achtet bei Bahn-Tickets darauf, dass dort \"Greifswald+City\" oder ähnliches steht. Das kostet beim Kauf nicht mehr, aber ihr könnt dann bis zum MaJuWi fahren und müsst nicht noch 2 Euro an den lokalen Verkehrsverbund zahlen. Ablauf Werktags (Montag - Freitag) läuft die Akademie wie folgt ab: 7:30 - 8:30 Uhr Frühstück 9:00 - 12:30 Uhr Kurs in Gebäuden der Uni Greifswald 12:30 - 14:00 Uhr Mittagessen in der Mensa der Uni Greifswald 19:30 - 20:00 Uhr Ankündigungen 20:00 - 21:00 Uhr Abendvortrag der Dozenten Dabei ist zu beachten, dass das MaJuWi (wo man schläft) schon ein gutes Stück von der Uni (wo die Kurse stattfinden) entfernt ist. Daher ist ein Fahrrad sehr hilfreich. Das kann man sich entweder selbst mitbringen, von Stipendiaten in Greifswald ausleihen oder kostenpflichtig von einer Firma ausleihen. Das sollte aber unbedingt vorher geklärt werden. Bei uns wurde ein Bus in der Früh vom MaJuWi zum Rubenow-Denkmal sowie einer um 12:45 vom Rubenow-Denkmal über die Mensa (Haltestelle \"Am St. Georgsfeld\") zum MaJuWi zurück. Am letzten Freitag gibt es einen \"Bunten Abend\". Dieser wird von den Stipendiaten organisiert und soll die Akademie unterhaltsam ausklingen lassen. Typischerweise fasst man den eigenen Kurs unterhaltsam zusammen (bzw. nimmt ihn ordentlich auf die Schippe - man muss ja auch über sich selbst lachen können). Räume Die Stipendiaten werden im Maritimen Jugenddorf Wieck (MaJuWi) untergebracht. Es sind 6-Bett Zimmer, welche 2016 mit größtenteils 4 Personen belegt waren. Leider gibt es nur 2 Schlüssel pro Zimmer. Das Problem haben wir gelöst, indem wir den Schlüssel an der Rezeption abgegeben haben. Photo-Sphere des MaJuWi Auch an der Uni gibt es wenig Steckdosen. Wenn ihr also mit den Notebooks arbeiten wollt, solltet ihr unbedingt eine Steckdosenleiste mitbringen. Auch ein HDMI-VGA-Adapter könnte nötig sein, wenn ihr nur einen VGA-Anschluss habt. Freizeit Seilgarten Boulderhalle : Zwar ist die Halle recht klein, aber sie hat ein interessantes Flair. Gerade für Anfänger gibt es mehr als genug Routen, aber man sollte nichts vergleichbares wie in Karlsruhe / München erwarten. Die Halle ist ziemlich versteckt. Segeln und Surfen : Segeln und Surfen bietet sich in Greifswald an. Allerdings sollte man die Teilnehmer mindestens 2 Wochen vorher anmelden, damit genug Plätze zur Verfügung stehen. Wir haben 4 Gruppen (2x Segeln und 2x Surfen) für jeweils Mo-Do von 15:00 bis 18:00 Uhr angemeldet. Die Segler sollten Kleidung mitnehmen welche nass werden darf. Ich hatte eine Badehose, ein Funktionsshirt sowie die \"Aqua Sphere BEACHWALKER XP\" Badeschuhe an (alte Turnschuhe tuns auch). Zum Surfen kann man in Badekleidung kommen, da die Neoprenanzüge ausgeliehen werden und im Preis inbegriffen sind. Herr Knopp von der Segel- / Surfschule ist hier sehr hilfreich bei der Beantwortung der Fragen. Für 25 Euro mehr kann man eine Prüfung machen und bekommt den Grundschein. Das sollte man sich recht früh überlegen, damit man das Kursmaterial durchgehen kann. Die Segelschule ist auf der gleichen Seite der Ryck wie das MaJuWi. Man muss einfach ein paar Meter Richtung Ostsee laufen und hat die Segelschule dann auf der rechten Seite. Bezahlt wird am ersten Tag, jeder für sich (obwohl es da wohl auch eine Regelung mit der Segelschule und dem MaJuWi gibt), in Bar. Wer die Prüfung macht bekommt die Urkunde vom VDWS . Zoo / Botanischer Garten Kreidefelsen auf Rügen Kreidefelsen und \"Wandern\" auf Rügen / Usedom / Hiddensee / Stralsund sind beliebte Ausflugsziele für das Wochenende Kajak-Fahren: Für 10 Euro kann man ein 2-er Kajak für 2 Stunden ausleihen. Wenn man länger unterwegs sein will kostet es halt mehr. Der Strand auf der anderen Seite, wenn man aus der Bucht / dem Hafen / der Anlegestelle (keine Ahnung wie man das nennt) heraus paddelt ist ganz nett. Lagerfeuer am MaJuWi Lagerfeuer mit Stockbrot und Gesang: Auf dem Gelände des MaJuWi ist eine Stelle wo man ein Lagerfeuer machen kann. Einfach beim MaJuWi nachfragen, dann bekommt man das Feuerholz (25 Euro?) sowie Teig für Stockbrot (0.50 Euro/person). In der Nähe des Strandbades kann man Stöcke für das Stockbrot finden. Wendelstein 7-X : Kann man besuchen, muss man aber anmelden. Spieleabende: Bei Werwolf sind immer einige dabei. Auch Russisch Tabu und Black Stories finden häufig regen Anklang. PowerPoint-Karaoke: Sollte auf max. 5 Minuten pro Beitrag beschränkt werden, die Folien sollten zumindest ein paar Bilder beinhalten und möglichst abwechslungsreich sein (also nicht nur z.B. Chemische Formeln / nur Mathe / nur Texte) Packliste Kleidung und Hygiene-Zeugs (surprise, surprise). Es empfiehlt sich recht viel an Kleidung dabei zu haben, da man nicht direkt am MaJuWi waschen kann. Zwar kann man in der Pension \"Ship In\" für 4 Euro waschen und für nochmals 4 Euro trocknen, aber das hat - zumindest bei mir - nicht so toll geklappt. Eventuell lohnt es sich etwas Handwaschmittel und einen Kleiderbügel zum trocknen dabei zu haben. Handtücher bekommt man vom MaJuWi, aber ein großes Handtuch für den Strand sollte man mitnehmen. Mehrfachsteckdosenleisten : Es gibt in den 6-Bett Zimmern nur eine Steckdose. Wenn nun 4 Leute mit Smartphone, Notebook, elektrischer Zahnbürste, Digitalkamera und Rasierer kommen sollte man das auf jeden Fall mitnehmen. Ich hatte den Anker PowerCore 20100mAh dabei und war damit recht glücklich. Stirnlampe / Taschenlampe: Ist nützlich, wenn man abends nicht mehr das Licht anmachen will aber dennoch was sehen muss. Beispielsweise wenn man ins Zimmer kommt wenn die anderen schon schlafen. Die Stirnlampe ist zusätzlich zum Fahrradfahren praktisch. Von den geliehenen Rädern waren bei vielen die Lichter kaputt. Mücken-Abwehrmittel (z.B. Autan): Auf dem MaJuWi-Gelände ist ein Teich und abends gibt es Unmengen an Mücken. Sport Tischtennis-Schläger: Es gibt Tischtennis-Platten und man kann Schläger ausleihen. Aber eventuell wollt ihr ja eure eigenen Schläger mitnehmen. Boulder-Schuhe: Man kann glaube ich Boulder-Schuhe ausleihen, aber nicht sonderlich viele. Wenn ihr also bouldern wollt und selbst Schuhe habt, dann nehmt sie einfach mit. Kamera: Es ist schön, wenn man nach der Akademie ein paar Erinnerungen hat. Mindestens einer sollte für das Abschlussfoto auch eine gute Kamera dabei haben. Rucksack: Wenn man Tagesausflüge macht oder einfach nur das Kursmaterial (Block, Notebook, whatever) vom MaJuWi zu den Kursräumen bringen will sollte man schon einen kleinen Rucksack dabei haben. Organisatorisches Eine Austauschplatform (z.B. eine Facebook-Gruppe) vor Beginn der Akademie einzurichten ist praktisch. Dann kann man die gemeinsame An- und Abreise organisieren, Kurs-relevantes klären sowie die Freizeit-Sachen planen. Wenn ihr - wie wir es gemacht haben - eine Facebook-Gruppe erstellt, solltet ihr darauf rücksicht nehmen, dass manche Leute Facebook nicht benutzen wollen. Dann kann man über das Daidalosnet auch die wichtigsten Informationen an alle per E-Mail schicken. Es sollten sich Personen für folgende Gruppen finden: Bunter Abend: Irgendjemand muss es organisieren und moderieren sowie z.B. die Technik-Fragen klären. Bar-Team: Einkaufen von Getränken, tragen der Getränke zum MaJuWi, aufräumen von eventuell herumstehenden Flaschen. Mindestens einen Autofahrer braucht man hier. Vom MaJuWi kann man dann auch eine Kühltruhe bekommen. Chor: Ist immer schön für den Bunten Abend Segeln / Surfen: z.B. Anmeldung über Google Docs (Vorname, Nachname, Segeln und- / oder Surfen). Fahrräder: Vermutlich wollen immer einige Leute ein Fahrrad in Greifswald haben, können aber keines mitbringen. Das sollte man vorher klären. Wir haben für fahrtaugliche, aber dennoch recht schlechte Räder 4.50 Euro / Tag für 2 Wochen bezahlt. Eventuell kann man da was besser machen.

Gradient descent Gradient descent is an optimization rule which starts at a point \\(x_0\\) and then applies the update rule $$x_{k+1} = x_k + \\eta d_k(x_k)$$ where \\(\\eta\\) is the step length (learning rate) and \\(d_k\\) is the direction. The direction is $$d_k(x_k) = - \\nabla f(x_k)$$ Example $$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix}6x + 2y\\\\6y + 2x\\end{pmatrix}$$ \\begin{align} x_0 &= (6, 6) & d_k(6, 6) &= (-24, -24)\\\\ x_1 &= (-18, -18) & d_k(-18, -18) &= (72, 72\\\\ x_2 &= (54, 54) & d_k(54, 54) &= (-216, -216)\\\\ x_3 &= (-162, -162) & d_k(-162, -162) &= (648, 648) \\end{align} In general: \\begin{align} x_n &= (x_{n-1} - 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x_{n-1}, x_{n-1} - 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x_{n-1})\\\\ x_n &= (-3x_{n-1}, -3x_{n-1}) \\end{align} You can clearly see that any learning rate \\(\\eta > \\frac{1}{8}\\) will diverge. For this example, the learning rate \\(\\eta = \\frac{1}{8}\\) would find the solution in one step and any \\(\\eta < \\frac{1}{8}\\) will converge to the global optimum.","tags":"Machine Learning","title":"Diverging Gradient Descent"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/tf-xor-tutorial/","text":"The XOR-Problem is a classification problem, where you only have four data points with two features. The training set and the test set are exactly the same in this problem. So the interesting question is only if the model is able to find a decision boundary which classifies all four points correctly. The XOR classification problem. 4 datapoints and two classes. All datapoints have 2 features. Neural Network basics I think of neural networks as a construction kit for functions. The basic building block - called a \"neuron\" - is usually visualized like this: It gets a variable number of inputx \\(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) , they get multiplied with weights \\(w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_n\\) , summed and a function \\(\\varphi\\) is applied to it. The weights is what you want to \"fine tune\" to make it actually work. When you have more of those neurons, you visualize it like this: In this example, it is only one output and 5 inputs, but it could be any number. The number of inputs and outputs is usually defined by your problem, the intermediate is to allow it to fit more exact to what you need (which comes with some other implications). Now you have some structure of the function set, you need to find weights which work. This is where backpropagation 3 comes into play. The idea is the following: You took functions ( \\(\\varphi\\) ) which were differentiable and combined them in a way which makes sure the complete function is differentiable. Then you apply an error function (e.g. the euclidean distance of the output to the desired output, Cross-Entropy) which is also differentiable. Meaning you have a completely differentiable function. Now you see the weights as variables and the data as given parameters of a HUGE function. You can differentiate (calculate the gradient) and go from your random weights \"a step\" in the direction where the error gets lower. This adjusts your weights. Then you repeat this steepest descent step and hopefully end up some time with a good function. For two weights, this awesome image by Alec Radford visualizes how different algorithms based on gradient descent find a minimum ( Source with even more of those): So think of back propagation as a shortsighted hiker trying to find the lowest point on the error surface: He only sees what is directly in front of him. As he makes progress, he adjusts the direction in which he goes. Targets and Error function First of all, you should think about how your targets look like. For classification problems, one usually takes as many output neurons as one has classes. Then the softmax function is applied. 1 The softmax function makes sure that the output of every single neuron is in \\([0, 1]\\) and the sum of all outputs is exactly \\(1\\) . This means the output can be interpreted as a probability distribution over all classes. Now you have to adjust your targets. It is likely that you only have a list of labels, where the \\(i\\) -th element in the list is the label for the \\(i\\) -th element in your feature list \\(X\\) (or the \\(i\\) -th row in your feature matrix \\(X\\) ). But the tools need a target value which fits to the error function. The usual error function for classification problems is cross entropy (CE). When you have a list of \\(n\\) features \\(x\\) , the target \\(t\\) and a classifier \\(clf\\) , then you calculate the cross entropy loss for this single sample by: $$CE(x, t) = - \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left (t&#94;{(i)} \\log \\left ({clf(x)}&#94;{(i)} \\right ) \\right)$$ Now we need a target value for each single neuron for every sample \\(x\\) . We get those by so called one hot encoding : The \\(k\\) classes all have their own neuron. If a sample \\(x\\) is of class \\(i\\) , then the \\(i\\) -th neuron should give \\(1\\) and all others should give \\(0\\) . 2 sklearn provides a very useful OneHotEncoder class. You first have to fit it on your labels (e.g. just give it all of them). In the next step you can transform a list of labels to an array of one-hot encoded targets: #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\"Mini-demo how the one hot encoder works.\"\"\" from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder import numpy as np # The most intuitive way to label a dataset \"X\" # (list of features, where X[i] are the features for a datapoint i) # is to have a flat list \"labels\" where labels[i] is the label for datapoint i. labels = [ 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] # The OneHotEncoder transforms those labels to something our models can # work with enc = OneHotEncoder () def trans_for_ohe ( labels ): \"\"\"Transform a flat list of labels to what one hot encoder needs.\"\"\" return np . array ( labels ) . reshape ( len ( labels ), - 1 ) labels_r = trans_for_ohe ( labels ) # The encoder has to know how many classes there are and what their names are. enc . fit ( labels_r ) # Now you can transform print ( enc . transform ( trans_for_ohe ([ 0 , 1 ])) . toarray () . tolist ()) Install Tensorflow The documentation about the installation makes a VERY good impression. Better than anything I can write in a few minutes, so ... RTFM 😜 For Linux systems with CUDA and without root privileges, you can install it with: $ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl --user But remember you have to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CUDA_HOME . For many configurations, adding the following lines to your .bashrc will work: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = \" $LD_LIBRARY_PATH :/usr/local/cuda/lib64\" export CUDA_HOME = /usr/local/cuda I currently (19.07.2016) to use Tensorflow rc0.7 ( installation instructions ) with CUDA 7.5 ( installation instructions ). I had a couple of problems with other versions (e.g. #3342 , #2810 , #2034 , but that might only have been bad luck. Who knows.). Tensorflow basics Tensorflow helps you to define the neural network in a symbolic way. This means you do not explicitly tell the computer what to compute to inference with the neural network, but you tell it how the data flow works. This symbolic representation of the computation can then be used to automatically caluclate the derivates. This is awesome! So you don't have to make this your own. But keep it in mind that it is only symbolic as this makes a few things more complicated and different from what you might be used to. Tensorflow has placeholders and variables . Placeholders are the things in which you later put your input. This is your features and your targets, but might be also include more. Variables are the things the optimizer calculates. Now you should be able to understand the following code which solves the XOR problem. It defines a neural network with two input neurons, 2 neurons in a first hidden layer and 2 output neurons. All neurons have biases. #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\" Solve the XOR problem with Tensorflow. The XOR problem is a two-class classification problem. You only have four datapoints, all of which are given during training time. Each datapoint has two features: x o o x As you can see, the classifier has to learn a non-linear transformation of the features to find a propper decision boundary. \"\"\" __author__ = \"Martin Thoma\" __email__ = \"info@martin-thoma.de\" import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder def trans_for_ohe ( labels ): \"\"\"Transform a flat list of labels to what one hot encoder needs.\"\"\" return np . array ( labels ) . reshape ( len ( labels ), - 1 ) def analyze_classifier ( sess , i , w1 , b1 , w2 , b2 , XOR_X , XOR_T ): \"\"\"Visualize the classification.\"\"\" print ( ' \\n Epoch %i ' % i ) print ( 'Hypothesis %s ' % sess . run ( hypothesis , feed_dict = { input_ : XOR_X , target : XOR_T })) print ( 'w1= %s ' % sess . run ( w1 )) print ( 'b1= %s ' % sess . run ( b1 )) print ( 'w2= %s ' % sess . run ( w2 )) print ( 'b2= %s ' % sess . run ( b2 )) print ( 'cost (ce)= %s ' % sess . run ( cross_entropy , feed_dict = { input_ : XOR_X , target : XOR_T })) # Visualize classification boundary xs = np . linspace ( - 5 , 5 ) ys = np . linspace ( - 5 , 5 ) pred_classes = [] for x in xs : for y in ys : pred_class = sess . run ( hypothesis , feed_dict = { input_ : [[ x , y ]]}) pred_classes . append (( x , y , pred_class . argmax ())) xs_p , ys_p = [], [] xs_n , ys_n = [], [] for x , y , c in pred_classes : if c == 0 : xs_n . append ( x ) ys_n . append ( y ) else : xs_p . append ( x ) ys_p . append ( y ) plt . plot ( xs_p , ys_p , 'ro' , xs_n , ys_n , 'bo' ) plt . show () # The training data XOR_X = [[ 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 ], [ 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 1 ]] # Features XOR_Y = [ 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 ] # Class labels assert len ( XOR_X ) == len ( XOR_Y ) # sanity check # Transform labels to targets enc = OneHotEncoder () enc . fit ( trans_for_ohe ( XOR_Y )) XOR_T = enc . transform ( trans_for_ohe ( XOR_Y )) . toarray () # The network nb_classes = 2 input_ = tf . placeholder ( tf . float32 , shape = [ None , len ( XOR_X [ 0 ])], name = \"input\" ) target = tf . placeholder ( tf . float32 , shape = [ None , nb_classes ], name = \"output\" ) nb_hidden_nodes = 2 # enc = tf.one_hot([0, 1], 2) w1 = tf .

I recommend reading the Tensorflow Whitepaper if you want to understand Tensorflow better. Footnotes Softmax is similar to the sigmoid function, but with normalization. ↩ Actually, we don't want this. The probability of any class should never be exactly zero as this might cause problems later. It might get very very small, but should never be 0. ↩ Backpropagation is only a clever implementation of gradient descent. It belongs to the bigger class of iterative descent algorithms. ↩","tags":"Machine Learning","title":"XOR tutorial with TensorFlow"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/estimating-demand/","text":"I've just had the problem that I'm helping to plan a group event, where the participants should all have bikes. There are 170 participants and 80 bikes. Some of the participants might be able to bring their own bikes. So we asked them to tell us who can't bring a bike with them. Only 79 answered. Only 7 of them can bring their own bike. How many bikes should we try to organize to be 95% sure that everybody will have a bike? Modelling Let \\(X\\) be the random variable which represents the number of people who will not bring their own bikes.

Typically, problems in optimization are stated like this: $$ \\begin{align} &\\underset{x}{\\operatorname{minimize}}& & f(x) \\\\ &\\operatorname{subject\\;to} & &g_i(x) \\leq 0, \\quad i = 1,\\dots,m \\\\ &&&h_i(x) = 0, \\quad i = 1, \\dots,p \\end{align} $$ where \\(f(x): \\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is the loss function (objective function) to be minimized over the variable \\(x\\) , \\(g_i(x) \\leq 0\\) are called inequality constraints , and \\(h_i(x) = 0\\) are called equality constraints . By convention, the standard form defines a minimization problem . A maximization problem can be treated by negating the objective function. (That was copied from en.wikipedia.org/w/Optimization_problem and only slightly edited.) I'm now going to explain some very basic techniques which are used for finding good solutions to optimization problems. Please note that there are also discrete optimization problems where you have to finde a solution \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}&#94;n\\) . I will only focus on continuous optimization problems. Simulated Annealing Simulated Annealing is a heuristical optimization algorithm. It starts at a random point \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) . Then it takes a random point \\(y\\) of the environment of \\(x\\) : $$y \\in U(x)$$ If \\(f(y) \\leq f(x)\\) , then the current position \\(x\\) is overwritten with \\(y\\) : $$x \\leftarrow y$$ Otherwise, it might be overwritten with probability \\(\\exp \\left (-\\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{T(t)} \\right )\\) where \\(T: \\mathbb{N}_0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{> 0}\\) is called the temperature at time \\(t\\) . So the optimization algorithm is: Take a random point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n$ Take a random point $y \\in U(x)$ $$x \\leftarrow \\begin{cases}y &\\text{if } f(y) \\leq f(x)\\\\ y &\\text{if } \\operatorname{rand}(0,1) < \\exp \\left (-\\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{T(t)} \\right )\\\\ x &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$ Go to step 2. See also my German description . Gradient descent The gradient descent algorithm can easily be applied when the optimization problem has no constraints and the objective function \\(f\\) is differentiable. The idea is to just take a random starting point \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) and iteratively improve it. There are many algorithms which follow this approach (Simulated annealing, L-BFGS, Newton's method, Quasi-Newtonian, Conjugate Gradient, ...). Instead of randomly going in other directions, the gradient \\(\\nabla f\\) is calculated at the position \\(x\\) . The gradient points in the direction of maximum increase, so we go in the opposite direction: $$x_{\\text{new}} = x - \\nabla f(x)$$ The problem with this approach is that the surface of the objective function might first go down in the direction of \\(\\nabla f(x)\\) , but if you go a bit further it can go up by a lot. So we want to make very small steps. To achive this, we multiply the gradient with a factor \\(\\eta \\in (0, 1]\\) . In machine learining, this \\(\\eta\\) is called the learning rate and typically one chooses \\(\\eta = 0.01\\) . However, there are learning rate scheduling algorithms which adapt this parameter during training. The update rule is: $$x_{\\text{new}} = x - \\eta \\nabla f(x)$$ Iterative Descent A more general formulation of the Gradient descent algorithm is called iterative descent. The idea is to start at some arbitrary \\(x_0\\) and iteratively update the current guess of the minimum to $$x_{k+1} = x_k + \\eta \\cdot d_k$$ where \\(\\eta \\in (0, 1]\\) is the step length (learning rate) and $$d_k = -D_k \\nabla f(x_k)$$ is the direction of the descent. The direction depends on the Gradient \\(\\nabla f(x_k)\\) , but also on a matrix \\(D_k\\) : $D_k = I$: Gradient descent $D_k = H_f&#94;{-1}(x_k)$: Newtons method, where $H_f$ is the Hessian matrix of $f$ Linear Regression with MSE In linear regression one is given a list of \\(n\\) points \\((x, y)\\) with \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;m\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) . The task is to find a matrix \\(A \\in \\mathbb{1 \\times m}\\) such that the predicted value \\(\\hat{y}\\) of the linear model $$\\hat{y}(x) = A \\cdot x$$ minimizes the term $$\\text{MSE} = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (y_i - \\hat{y}(x_i))&#94;2$$ For convenience, one can write the list of points as a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times m}\\) and a vector \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) : $$\\text{MSE} = \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T\\|_2$$ with the Euclidean norm $$\\| v \\|_2 := \\sqrt{ ( v_1 )&#94;2 + ( v_2 )&#94;2 + \\dotsb + ( v_n )&#94;2 } = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n ( v_i )&#94;2 \\right)&#94;{1/2}$$ Every part of the sum is non-negative, so exponentiating the Euclidean norm with a positive factor will not change the result of the minimization: $$\\operatorname{minimize}_{A} \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T\\|_2&#94;2$$ Now we can see that this is every element of the vector squared. So we can get rid of the norm and then use distributivity: $$ \\begin{align} \\operatorname{minimize}_{A}&(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T)&#94;T \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T)\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\operatorname{minimize}_{A}&(\\mathbf{y}&#94;T - A \\mathbf{X}&#94;T) \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T)\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\operatorname{minimize}_{A}&\\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{y} - A \\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T + A\\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T\\\\ \\end{align} $$ You need to know that $$ \\begin{align} A \\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{y} &= ((A \\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{y})&#94;T)&#94;T\\\\ &= (\\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T)&#94;T\\\\ &= \\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T\\\\ \\end{align} $$ You can get rid of the last transposing operation, because $$(\\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T) \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{1 \\times 1}$$ This simplifies the optimization problem to $$\\operatorname{minimize}_{A}\\underbrace{\\mathbf{y}&#94;T \\mathbf{y} - 2 A \\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{y} + A\\mathbf{X}&#94;T \\mathbf{X} A&#94;T}_{E_{X, y}(A)}$$ Now you can calculate the gradient of this term with respect to \\(A\\) : $$\\nabla E_{X, y}(A) = 2 X&#94;T X A&#94;T - X&#94;T y - X&#94;T y = 2 X&#94;T (X A&#94;T - y)$$ A necessary condition of a minimum is the gradient to be 0: $$ \\begin{align} \\nabla E_{X, y}(A) &\\overset{!}{=} 0\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow 0 &\\overset{!}{=} 2 X&#94;T (X A&#94;T - y)\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow 0 &\\overset{!}{=} X&#94;T X A&#94;T - X&#94;T y\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow A &\\overset{!}{=} ((X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1} X&#94;T y)&#94;T\\\\ \\end{align} $$ As \\(H_{E_{X, y}} = \\nabla&#94;2 E_{X, y}(A) = 2 X&#94;T X\\) is positive definite, this is a minimum. Hence, the optimal solution to this problem is: $$A = ((X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1} X&#94;T y)&#94;T$$ Lagrange multipliers Lagrange multipliers are a trick in optimization problems with constraints. They can be used to get rid of the constraints. The Lagrange function has the form $$\\mathcal{L} (x, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n) = f(x) + \\sum_{j=1}&#94;n \\lambda_j h_j(x)$$ with the Lagrange multipliers \\(\\lambda_j \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(h_j\\) are equality constraints.

Examples First of all, I want to make sure you understand what those functions do. You might also want to have a look at my old article Functional Programming in Python . map numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) squares = map ( lambda x : x ** 2 , numbers ) print ( squares ) gives [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] filter def is_prime ( element ): if element == 2 : return True elif element <= 1 or element % 2 == 0 : return False else : for i in range ( 3 , element , 2 ): if element % i == 0 : return False return True myList = [ 4 , 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 11 ] r = filter ( is_prime , myList ) print ( r ) gives [13, 2, 7, 11, 11] . reduce numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) diff = reduce ( lambda x , y : x - y , numbers ) print ( diff ) gives -45 , because $$((((((((0-1)-2)-3)-4)-5)-6)-7)-8)-9 = -45$$ Sequential solution The standard way to do these tasks without map , filter and reduce is to use loops. map numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) squares = [] for x in numbers : squares . append ( x ** 2 ) print ( squares ) filter def is_prime ( element ): if element == 2 : return True elif element <= 1 or element % 2 == 0 : return False else : for i in range ( 3 , element , 2 ): if element % i == 0 : return False return True my_list = [ 4 , 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 11 ] r = [] for x in my_list : if is_prime ( x ): r . append ( x ) print ( r ) reduce numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) x = numbers [ 0 ] for y in numbers [ 1 :]: x = x - y print ( x ) List comprehensions List comprehensions are - according to Guido van Rossum - the way to go. So lets see how the code looks like without map , reduce and filter . map numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) squares = [ x ** 2 for x in numbers ] print ( squares ) I think that is much more readable than the map solution. filter def is_prime ( element ): if element == 2 : return True elif element <= 1 or element % 2 == 0 : return False else : for i in range ( 3 , element , 2 ): if element % i == 0 : return False return True my_list = [ 4 , 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 11 ] r = [ x for x in my_list if is_prime ( x )] print ( r ) I also think this is more readable, as you can easily combine it with more transformations. reduce This is the tricky one. List comprehensions create lists again, so using only list comprehensions is not going to work. However, you could cheat. sum(numbers) is essentially reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers) . So we only have to change the sign, except for the first one: numbers = list ( range ( 10 )) diff = sum ([ numbers [ 0 ]] + [ - x for x in numbers [ 1 :]]) print ( diff ) So, granted, the code using reduce looks much better. However, people argue that you should use the sequential solution because it is simpler to understand. By now, I understood every piece of code using reduce . But I haven't seen it too often.","tags":"Code","title":"Pythons map, reduce and filter as list comprehensions"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/linear-classification/","text":"In classification problems you have data points \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;m\\) which you want to classify into one of \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 2}\\) classes. This is a supervised task. This means you have \\(n\\) data points for training in a matrix \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times m}\\) with their labels. 1 Initially, the label might be something like \"cat\" or \"dog\". But the machine learning algorithms can't deal with those directly, so you need to encode the labels. The simplest way of encoding them is to use integers \\(0, 1, \\dots, k - 1\\) . However, in many cases it is handy to use a one-hot encoding . This means you make a \\(k\\) -dimensional vector for each label. \\((1, 0)\\) might encode \"dog\" and \\((0, 1)\\) might encode \"cat\". sklearn supports this encoding in a convenient way ( docs ). Another common encoding is \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) for binary classification problems. 2 A linear model is one which applies only linear operations to the features. So basically the model may only be a matrix. Typically the elements of the matrix are called weights , because they weight the importance of each feature. The objective of such a classifier 4 is to find a matrix \\(W&#94;*\\) such that the MSE is as small as possible on the test set \\(D\\) : $$W&#94;* = \\arg \\min_{W} E_{MSE} (f_W, D)$$ One-hot encoding If one-hot encoded labels are used, 3 a linear classifier $$f: \\text{feature space} \\rightarrow \\text{class space}$$ usually works like this: $$f(x) = {\\arg \\max}_{i \\in 1, \\dots, k} (W \\cdot x)&#94;{(i)}$$ with \\(W \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{k \\times m}\\) and \\(&#94;{(i)}\\) denoting the \\(i\\) -th element of the vector. Given a test set $$D = \\{(x_i, y_i) \\text{ with } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n_t\\}, x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{m}, y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_+&#94;{k}\\}$$ you can calculate the mean squared error (MSE) of the classifier \\(f\\) : $$E_{MSE}(f, D) = \\frac{1}{n_t}\\sum_{i=1}&#94;{n_t} (t_i - W \\cdot x_i)&#94;T (t_i - W \\cdot x_i)$$ Please note that the MSE is always non-negative for every single data point. Normalizing the output The nice thing about the MSE is that it is simple. It can easily be calculated and is used in regression problems very often. What is not so nice is the fact that it punishes several good solutions, too. For example, say we have a data point \\(x_1\\) which has the target \\((1, 0)&#94;T\\) . The classification output $$c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}101\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad E_{MSE}(f, x_1) = 100&#94;2\\tag{1.1}$$ while the classification output of another point \\(x_2\\) is $$c_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0.1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad E_{MSE}(f, x_2) = 1 + 0.1&#94;2\\tag{1.2}$$ This is problematic, as the actual classification in \\((1.1)\\) is correct whereas the classification in \\((1.2)\\) is wrong. However, this can easily be fixed by normalizing the result. Simple Normalization The simplest way to normalize the result of the classifier would be to divide each entry by the sum of all entries, e.g. for \\((1.1)\\) we get $$ \\begin{align} c_1' &= \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad &E_{MSE}(f'', x_1) &= 0\\tag{2.1}\\\\ c_2' &= \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\\quad &E_{MSE}(f', x_2) &= 1\\tag{2.2} \\end{align} $$ Standardization You might want to interpret the output of your classifier as a probability of the data point belonging to the different classes. Then you may not have negative values and you also want to avoid a probability of 0. A common normalization then is the softmax function \\(\\sigma\\) . It first exponentiates the single values and then normalizes: $$\\begin{align} c_1'' &= \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{e&#94;{101}}{e&#94;{101} + e&#94;0}\\\\\\frac{e&#94;{0}}{e&#94;{101} + e&#94;0}\\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\quad &E_{MSE}(f'', x_1) &\\approx 0\\tag{3.1}\\\\ c_2'' &= \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{e&#94;{0}}{e&#94;{0} + e&#94;{0.1}}\\\\\\frac{e&#94;{0.1}}{e&#94;{0} + e&#94;{0.1}}\\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix}0.475\\\\0.525\\end{pmatrix}\\quad &E_{MSE}(f'', x_2) &\\approx 0.551\\tag{3.2} \\end{align}$$ Note that this is the same as a neural network with only an input layer and a softmax output layer. Now the optimization problem is: $$ \\begin{align} W&#94;* &= \\arg \\min_{W \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{k \\times m}} E(f'', D)\\\\ &= \\arg \\min_{W \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{k \\times m}} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))&#94;T \\\\ &= \\arg \\min_{W \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{k \\times m}} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))&#94;T \\\\ \\end{align} $$ This is a differentiable function. This means to optimize we can calculate the gradient and apply gradient descent: $$ \\begin{align} &\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))&#94;T\\\\ =& \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))&#94;T\\\\ =& \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i)) \\right ) \\left(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i) \\right)&#94;T + (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i)) \\left (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i))\\right )\\\\ =& \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} \\sigma(W x_i) \\right ) \\left(t_i - \\sigma(W x_i) \\right)&#94;T + (t_i - \\sigma(W x_i)) \\left (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} \\sigma(W x_i)\\right )&#94;T\\\\ \\end{align}$$ as you can see it gets quite ugly. I don't want to continue this calculation here. But I hope you can see that this is possible. stats.stackexchange.com gives some hints on how to continue. Decision boundary The decision boundary for a two-class problem with 2-dimensional data vectors (and one bias) can be calculated as $$ \\begin{align} &W&#94;{(0, 0)} \\cdot 1 + W&#94;{(0, 1)} \\cdot x_1 + W&#94;{(0, 2)} \\cdot x_2 = W&#94;{(1, 0)} \\cdot 1 + W&#94;{(1, 1)} \\cdot x_1 + W&#94;{(1, 2)} \\cdot x_2\\tag{DB}\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow x_2&= \\frac{W&#94;{(0, 0)} \\cdot 1 + W&#94;{(0, 1)} \\cdot x_1 - (W&#94;{(1, 0)} \\cdot 1 + W&#94;{(1, 1)} \\cdot x_1)}{W&#94;{(1, 2)} - W&#94;{(0, 2)}}\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow x_2 &= \\frac{(W&#94;{(0, 1)} - W&#94;{(1, 1)})}{W&#94;{(1, 2)} - W&#94;{(0, 2)}} \\cdot x_1 + \\frac{W&#94;{(0, 0)} - W&#94;{(1, 0)}}{W&#94;{(1, 2)} - W&#94;{(0, 2)}} \\end{align} $$ As you can see, the decision boundary of the non-normalized form is a line: $$y = a \\cdot x + b \\qquad a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$$ Please also note that \\(W&#94;{(1, 2)} = W&#94;{(0, 2)}\\) is possible, which would mean that the line is parallel to the \\(x_2\\) axis. So this model basically only has 2 parameter combinations which matter, although it has 6 values which can be adjusted. But many combinations are equivalent. What does normalization change? For given \\(W, x\\) it only divides both sides of the equation by the same constant. Hence it doesn't change the decision boundary. What does standardization with softmax change? Just like with normalization, softmax makes equation \\((DB)\\) to be divided by a constant. This can be ignored. The exponentiation can also be ignored as we can simply take the logartihm of both sides of \\((DB)\\) . Or in other words: A neural network with only one input layer and one softmax output layer also has a linear decision boundary! -1/+1 encoding In the 2-class case one might consider to use -1 for one class and +1 for the other class as targets. Then the classifcation is $$ \\begin{cases} \\text{class with label 1}&\\text{if } f(x) \\geq 0\\\\ \\text{class with label -1}&\\text{if } f(x) < 0 \\end{cases} $$ The matrix \\(W\\) is now in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;{1 \\times 3}\\) and the classifier is $$f(x) = W x$$ To make sure that this is either \\(-1\\) or \\(+1\\) , one can modify it to $$f'(x) = \\frac{W x}{|W x|}$$ Note that this ignores the case \\(Wx = 0\\) . Now we can easily calculate the MSE: $$E_{MSE}(f, D) = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;{n_t} {(t_i - f'(x))}&#94;2$$ Differences from target encoding You might wonder if it makes a difference which type of encoding you use for your target. There are some things which come to my mind: (+) One-hot encoding can easily be expanded to more than two classes, in contrast to \\(-1/+1\\) encoding. (+) With one-hot encoding, you can easily get a probability distribution for the classes you are interested in. This is certainly also possible with \\(-1/+1\\) encoding, but it doesn't strike my eye as clearly. (-) One-hot encoding needs more storage space. (?) \\(-1/+1\\) encoding is used in SVMs (see SVM article ), so it might have advantages in maximum margin classification.

This means you have to model your system in the form $$\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \\mathbf{x}_k + B_k a_k + r_k&#94;{(s)}$$ with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}, \\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x}\\) being the state vectors, \\(A_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_x}\\) being the system matrix, \\(B_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_a}\\) being the control matrix, \\(a_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_a}\\) being the control matrix vector ( \\(a\\) for action), \\(r_k&#94;{(s)} \\sim \\mathcal{N(0, C_k&#94;{(r_s)})}\\) with \\(C_k&#94;{(r_s)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_x}\\) being Gaussian noise. \\(C_k&#94;{(r_s)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_x}\\) is called the process error covariance matrix. You can also make a model of your measurements . They should be some linear combination of the state with Gaussian noise \\(r_k&#94;{(m)}\\) : $$z_k = H \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_k + r_k&#94;{(m)}$$ with \\(z_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_m}\\) : The measurement vector \\(r_k&#94;{(r_m)} \\sim \\mathcal{N(0, C_k&#94;{(r_m)})}\\) with \\(C_k&#94;{(r_m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_m \\times n_m}\\) being Gaussian noise. \\(C_k&#94;{(r_m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_m \\times n_m}\\) is called the measurment noise covariance matrix. \\(H \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_m \\times n_x}\\) : A matrix which transforms the state vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to a measurement vector. This matrix is a constant over the whole process. It is most likely to have only 0s and 1s as entrys. Step 3: The algorithm Overview of the Kalman-filter. The inputs are orange , the outputs are blue . The matrices which were not explained so far are: \\(P_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_x}\\) is the state vector covariance matrix. It is the uncertainty. \\(K_k \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x \\times n_m}\\) : The Kalman gain. Higher values indicate that we give more trust to the measurment. Lower values indicate that we give more trust to our last prediction. If the measurement uncertainty \\(C_k&#94;{(m)}\\) is small compared to the state uncertainty \\(P_k&#94;{(P)}\\) , then the Kalman Gain is big. So we will rely more on the measurement and less of what we predicted before. The complexity of the Kalman filter is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n_z&#94;{2.4} + n_x&#94;2)\\) According to Cyrill Stachniss . The factor \\(2.4\\) comes from matrix inversion. Example Suppose you want to track the position of a car in 2D. What you get as sensor data is the current position. So the state is $$\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\\\dot{x}\\\\\\dot{y}\\end{pmatrix}$$ where \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the position in m away from some predefined point, \\(\\dot{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the velocity in m/s at starting time and \\(\\ddot{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is the acceleration in \\(m/s&#94;2\\) . The measurements are $$\\mathbf{z} = \\begin{pmatrix}x&#94;{(M)}\\\\y&#94;{(M)}\\end{pmatrix}$$ What you get to choose is the acceleration at each time step \\(i\\) (time steps have the length \\(t\\) ): $$a = \\begin{pmatrix}\\ddot{x}&#94;{(a)}\\\\\\ddot{y}&#94;{(a)}\\end{pmatrix}$$ As the Kalman filter is a linear filter, the state model is: $$\\mathbf{x}&#94;{(P)}_k = A\\mathbf{x}_k + Ba_k$$ The measurement is dependent on the state, with some noise \\(r_k&#94;m\\) : $$\\mathbf{z}_k = H \\mathbf{x}_k + r_k&#94;m$$ with \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{4 \\times 4}\\) , \\(H \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{2 \\times 4}\\) . As one can decompose the acceleration / speed in the directions and the equation for the new position is $$\\begin{align}x_{new}(t) &= x + \\dot{x} t + 0.5 \\ddot{x} t&#94;2\\\\ y_{new}(t) &= y + \\dot{y} t + 0.5 \\ddot{y} t&#94;2\\\\ \\dot{x}_{new}(t) &= \\dot{x} + \\ddot{x} t\\\\ \\dot{y}_{new}(t) &= \\dot{y} + \\ddot{y} t\\end{align}$$ So given the state model, we get: $$\\mathbf{x}&#94;{(P)} = \\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}1& 0 & t & 0\\\\ 0& 1 & 0 & t\\\\ 0& 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0& 0 & 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}_{A_k} \\mathbf{x}_k + \\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}0.5t&#94;2 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0.5t&#94;2\\\\ t & 0\\\\ 0 & t\\end{pmatrix}}_{B_k} \\cdot a_k$$ The choice of the initial uncertainty covariance matrix \\(P_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{4 \\times 4}\\) / the initial state \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) doesn't matter too much. The Kalman filter algorithm will fix both over enough steps. Common choices are the zero-vector for \\(\\mathbb{x}\\) and \\(P_0 = c \\cdot I\\) as the covariance matrix with the identity matrix \\(I\\) and \\(c\\) being big compared with the noise. For this example, a reasonable choice is the diagonal matrix $$P_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}a_1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & a_2 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & a_3 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & a_4\\end{pmatrix}$$ with \\(a_1 = a_2 = 20000000\\) as the earths diameter is about \\(40000\\textrm{ km}\\) and \\(a_3=a_4=90\\) as going more than \\(324\\textrm{ km/h}\\) is extremely rarely going to happen for a car. For the initial state parameter, you could wait two time steps: $$\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}x&#94;{(M)}_{-1}\\\\ y&#94;{(M)}_{-1}\\\\ x&#94;{(M)}_{-1} - x&#94;{(M)}_{-2}\\\\ y&#94;{(M)}_{-1} - y&#94;{(M)}_{-2}\\end{pmatrix}$$ Prediction step The state prediction works as above: $$\\mathbf{x}&#94;{(P)}_{k+1} = A_k \\mathbf{x}_{k} + B_k a_k$$ Covariance prediction: $$P_{k+1}&#94;{(P)} = A P_k A&#94;T + C_k&#94;{(r_s)} \\quad \\text{with}\\quad C_k&#94;{(r_s)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{4 \\times 4}.$$ The process error covariance \\(C_k&#94;{(r_s)}\\) expresses the error in the system. It is a covariance matrix and thus has to be symmetric and positive definite. It encodes errors in the modeling itself as well as errors in the actions. Innovation step Innovation, which compares the measurement with the prediction: $$\\tilde{y}_{k+1} = z_{k+1} - H \\mathbf{x}&#94;{(P)}_{k+1}$$ The observation matrix \\(H \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{2 \\times 4}\\) in the example is $$H = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix},$$ as it encodes the relationship between the state and the measurement. Innovation Covariance: $$S_{k+1} = H P_{k+1}&#94;{(P)} H&#94;T + C_k&#94;{(r_m)}$$ For the measurement error covariance \\(C_k&#94;{(r_m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{2 \\times 2}\\) I have to know something about the way my sensors work. I guess this will usually be a diagonal matrix, as the sensors will be independent(?). Kalman Gain: $$K_{k+1} = P_{k+1}&#94;{(P)} H&#94;T S&#94;{-1}_{k+1}$$ Now, finally the state and covariance update: $$\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}&#94;{(P)}_{k+1} + K_{k+1} \\tilde{y}$$ $$P_{k+1} = (I - K_{k+1} H) P_{k+1}&#94;{(P)}$$ Miscallenious facts Error estimates How does the error estimate change in the Kalman filter steps? In the prediction step, you have a matrix $$\\tilde{P} = A \\cdot P \\cdot A&#94;T, \\qquad A, P \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}$$ ( \\(A\\) is the system matrix and \\(P\\) is the estimate of the error.) It has the property: $$\\det(\\tilde{P}) = \\det(A) \\cdot \\det(P) \\cdot \\det(A&#94;T) = 2 \\cdot \\det(A) \\cdot \\det(P)$$ So if the determinant of \\(P\\) is how we say if it gets bigger, then it will get bigger in the prediction step if \\(\\det(A) > 0.5\\) . Otherwise, it might still get bigger as the system noise \\(C_{k}&#94;{(s)}\\) gets added. In the filter step, things are more complicated. I don't know what to write about it, so I asked for help: How does the error estimate change in the Kalman filter? Perfect sensor What is the value of \\(K_k\\) if the sensor is perfect? A perfect sensor has no uncertainty. This means the variance \\(C_k&#94;{(m)}\\) is 0. It follows: $$K_k = P_k&#94;{(P)} H&#94;T (H&#94;T)&#94;{-1} (P_k&#94;{(P)})&#94;{-1} H&#94;{-1} = H&#94;{-1}$$ This leads to the uncertainty \\(P_k\\) getting 0 and the state \\(x_k\\) will be the measurement \\(z_k\\) . Really bad sensor What is the value of \\(K_k\\) if the sensor is as bad as possible? If we don't trust the sensor at all, the uncertainty is huge. The inverse of a huge term is close to 0. so the Kalman gain \\(K_k\\) is close to 0. This means neither the state \\(x_k\\) nor the error estimate \\(P_k\\) will change. Notation The system noise covariance matrix \\(C_k&#94;{(r_s)}\\) is often denoted with \\(Q\\) . Alternative State Equation Sometimes, the noise in the state equation is modelled in a different way: $$\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \\mathbf{x}_k + B_k a_k + G r_k&#94;{(s)}$$ Then you also have to adjust the filter step to $$P_{k+1}&#94;{(P)} = A_k P_k A_k&#94;T + G C_k&#94;{(r_s)} G&#94;T$$ See Why does it make sense to have noise of a different shape than the state vector? Extensions EKF UKF: Unscented Kalman filter deterministic sampling approximation of the first two moments does not need derivative (in contrast to EKF) Extended Kalman Filter The Kalman filter is the best filter for linear systems, but if you have a non-linear system model $$ \\begin{align} x_{k+1} &= p_k(x_k, a_k) + r_k&#94;{(s)}\\tag{system model}\\\\ z_k &= h_k(x_k) + r_k&#94;{(m)}\\tag{measurement model} \\end{align} $$ it cannot be applied any more. But the Extended Kalman Filter linearizes the function around some point with multivariate Taylor Series expansions and uses LQR with a Kalman filter. Assumptions: $p_k$ is differentiable. The non-linear part of $p_k$ in the environment of the linearization point is neglectable. One linearizes around nominal values \\(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k\\) . $$p_k(x_k, a_k) \\approx p_k(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k) + A_k (\\underbrace{x_k - \\bar{x}_k}_{=: \\Delta x_k}) + B_k (\\underbrace{a_k - \\bar{a}_k}_{\\Delta a_k})$$ with Jacobian matrices : $$A_k = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} p_k(x_k, a_k)|_{x_k = \\bar{x}_k, a_k = \\bar{a}_k}$$ $$B_k = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a_k} p_k(x_k, a_k)|_{x_k = \\bar{x}_k, a_k = \\bar{a}_k}$$ \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Lineares Modell: \\(\\Delta x_{k+1} \\approx A_k \\cdot \\Delta x_k + B_k \\Delta a_k\\) mit \\(\\Delta x_{k+1} = p_k(x_k, a_k) - p_k(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k)\\) Choice of nominal values \\(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k\\) : Policy: Zielzustand $\\bar{x}_k = x_+ = [0, \\dots, 0]&#94;T,\\quad\\bar{a}_k = [0, \\dots, 0]&#94;T\\qquad\\forall k$ Zustandssolltrajektorien bei Verfolgungsproblem Prädiktiv: $\\bar{x}_{k+1} = p_k(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k)$ mit $\\bar{x}_0 = E(x_0)$ und beliebig $\\bar{a}_{0:N-1}$ Iterativ: Starte mit beliebigem $\\bar{a}_{0:N-1}$ und $\\bar{x}_0 = E(x_0)$ Bestimme $\\bar{x}_{k+1} = p_k(\\bar{x}_k, \\bar{a}_k) \\forall k$ Linearisiere und löse LQR $\\Rightarrow \\bar{a}_k = \\pi_k(\\bar{x}_k)$ zurück zu 1.

Python implementation","tags":"Code","title":"Kalman Filter"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/thoughts-about-language/","text":"Language is a method of communication. It is used to transport information from one individuals brain to another brain. I'm not entirely sure about it, but I think every language which is wide-spread might be complete in a sense that once you know every word of the language you will be able to convey any concept or idea. In fact, even a tiny subset of natural languages might be enough to transport those ideas. Basic components of a complete language A complete language is always specific for the species for which it is used as one fundamental part is to describe sensory inputs . For example, bees can see other parts of the spectrum. They might describe flowers very different from us. Some of the sensory words are: pain bright, dark, red, blue, round, rectangular, straight, curved sweet, bitter smokey, stinking hard / soft, warm / cold, rough Another fundamental part of complete language are relationships : Spacial: A is over / below / right of B Temporal: A is before / after B Structural: A is part of B; A is a type of B Comparing: A is smaller than B; A is better than B; A is higher than B Thinking about this, there seem to be many conceptual words which cannot be explained with the ones given before: Language, knowledge, idea, wisdom, time, space Other components of natural languages Natural languages are much more than complete languages. They have words to define new words. Many words can be completely described with other words, but it is cumbersome to use many sentences instead of a single word. Also, there are synonyms, filling words, words and grammar which helps to distinguish other words and make sure the other one does not missunderstand you. Conclusions There are two important conclusions from these thoughts: First, the purpose of language is to convey ideas. This means one the one hand that you should use language like others do most of the time. On the other hand, there are some circumstances where you might want to ignore the \"official\" writing (e.g. in German \" das Kalman-Filter\" would be correct, but most people would intuitively say \" der Kalman-Filter\" - going with the intuitive version is fine here). Second, it might be possible to define a minimal complete language to describe the world.","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Thoughts about Language"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/us-problems/","text":"In the last few months I've seen a couple of astonishing and frightening stories about the US.

In der Vorlesung 'Informationsfusion' ist der Kalman-Filter ein zentraler Inhalt. Behandelter Stoff Grundlagen Slides: IF-Kap1_151110.pdf Es wurden Grundbegriffe wie Daten, Information, Merkmal, Informationsfusion, Signal, usw. eingeführt. Information Information ist alles was potentiell zur Verringerung von Ungewissheit beiträgt. Sinnvolle Informationen besteht aus Fakten und zugehörigen Unsicherheiten. Signal Ein Signal ist eine Funktion oder Wertefolge welche Information trägt. Daten Daten sind maschinenlesbare Repräsentationen von Informationen. Sie werden als Zeichen oder Zeichenketten gespeichert. Merkmal Ein Merkmal ist eine beobachtbare oder physikalisch messbare Eigenschaft eines oder mehrerer Objekte.

Frame of discernment ( Wahrnehmungsrahmen ) Der Wahrnehmungsrahmen ist eine Menge $\\Omega$. Die Elemente dieser Mengen heißen Alternativen oder Aussagen. Eine Hypothese ist eine Teilmenge $H \\subseteq \\Omega$ des Wahrnehmungsrahmens. Basismaß ( basic probability mass ) Sei $\\Omega$ ein Wahrnehmungsrahmen und $$m: \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ eine Abbildung von der Potenzmenge von $\\Omega$ in das Einheitsintervall. $m$ heißt Basismaß , wenn gilt: $m(\\emptyset) = 0$ $\\sum_{X \\subseteq \\Omega} m(X) = 1$ Belief function ( Glaubensfunktion ) Sei $\\Omega$ ein Wahrnehmungsrahmen, $m$ ein Basismaß und $$Bel: \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ eine Funktion. $Bel$ heißt Glaubensfunktion, wenn gilt: $$Bel(X) := \\sum_{Y \\subseteq X} m(Y)$$ Die Glaubensfunktion stellt also eine untere Grenze für eine unbekannte Wahrscheinlichkeitsfunktion dar. Plausibility function ( Plausibilitätsfunktion ) Sei $\\Omega$ ein Wahrnehmungsrahmen, $m$ ein Basismaß und $$Pl: \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ eine Funktion. $Pl$ heißt Plausibilitätsfunktion, wenn gilt: $$Pl(X) := \\sum_{Y \\cap X \\neq \\emptyset} m(Y)$$ Die Plausibilitätsfunktion stellt also eine obere Grenze für eine unbekannte Wahrscheinlichkeitsfunktion dar. Fokale Ereignisse Ein Ereignis $A$ heißt fokal bzg. eines Basismaßes $m$, wenn $m(A) \\neq 0$ gilt. Dempsters Kombinationsregel ( Dempsters rule of combination , DRC ) $$m_1 \\oplus m_2 (A) := \\begin{cases}0&\\text{for } A = \\emptyset\\\\ \\frac{\\sum_{X, Y: X \\cap Y = A} m_1(X) m_2(Y)}{|1-K|}\\end{cases}$$ für Konfliktgrad $$K := \\sum_{X, Y: X \\cap Y = \\emptyset} m_1(X) m_2(Y)$$ Bei einem Konfliktgrad von $0 < K < 1$ spricht man von einem partiellen Konflikt. Ist der Konfliktgrad gleich $K=1$, so ist DRC nicht anwendbar. DRC ist assoziativ und kommutativ, allerdings nicht idempotent. Es gilt also im Allgemeinen nicht $m \\oplus m = m$. Bei der Berechnung des Konfliktgrades genügt es fokale Ereignisse zu betrachten. Bayessche Fusion Angenommen man hat eine Klassifikationsaufgabe. $z$ gehört einer der Klassen $A, B, C$ an. Nun liefert ein Klassifizierer $d_1$ die Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung $$m_1(A) = 0.01 \\qquad m_1(B) = 0.99 \\qquad m_1(C) = 0$$ und ein zweiter Klassifizierer $d_2$ liefert $$m_2(A) = 0.01 \\qquad m_2(B) = 0 \\qquad m_2(C) = 0.99$$ Gesucht ist eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung, welche die beiden Ergebnisse fusioniert. Da kein Vorwissen existiert, wird das Maximum-Entropie-Prinzip für die a priori Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung verwendet. Man geht also a priori davon aus, dass jede Klasse gleich wahrscheinlich ist: $$P(z) = (\\frac{1}{3}; \\frac{1}{3}; \\frac{1}{3})$$ Nun gilt: $$ \\begin{align} P(z | d_1, d_2)&= \\frac{P(d_1, d_2 | z) \\cdot P(z)}{P(d_1, d_2)}\\\\ &= \\frac{P(d_1 | z) \\cdot P(d_2 | d_1, z) \\cdot P(z)}{P(d_1, d_2)}\\\\ &\\overset{(1)}{=} \\frac{P(d_1 | z) \\cdot P(d_2 | z) \\cdot P(z)}{P(d_1, d_2)}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\begin{pmatrix}0.1\\\\0.99\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}0.1\\\\0\\\\0.99\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}1/3\\\\1/3\\\\1/3\\end{pmatrix}}{P(d_1, d_2)}\\\\ &= \\frac{\\begin{pmatrix}1/300\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}}{P(d_1, d_2)}\\\\ &\\overset{(2)}{=} \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ \\end{align} $$ bei (1) wurde Unabhängigkeit vorausgesetzt, bei (2) wurde auf 1 normiert, damit eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung herauskommt.

Energie­funktionale Slides: IF-Kap7_160125.pdf Funktional Ein Funktional ist eine Funktion aus einem Vektorraum $V$ in den Körper, der dem Vektorraum zugrunde liegt. Oft ist $V$ ein Funktionenraum, also ein Vektorraum, dessen Elemente reell- oder komplexwertige Funktionen sind. Ein Funktional ist somit eine Funktion auf Funktionen. Energiefunktionale Durch die Einführung von Energietermen $E_k$ lassen sich fusionsrelevante Informationen modellieren. Die Fusionsaufgabe wird dann durch das Energiefunktional $$E = \\sum_k \\lambda_k E_k, \\qquad \\lambda_k > 0$$ repräsentiert. Die unterschiedliche Relevanz der Energieterme $E_k$ wird durch die Vorfaktoren $\\lambda_k$ berücksichtigt. Gibbs-Verteilung Die Gibbs-Verteilung mit dem Energiefunktional $E$ ist $$\\pi_{\\beta, E}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} e&#94;{- \\beta E(x)},$$ mit Normierungskonstante $Z$ und der inversen Temperatur $\\beta = \\frac{1}{T}$. Interpretation : Es sei $E: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, $V$ endlich. $V$: Die Menge aller Konfigurationen eines physikalischen Systems. $E(x)$: Energie des Systems, wenn es sich in der Konfiguration $x$ befindet. $T$: Temperatur. Ist die Temperatur groß, so sind alle Konfigurationen etwa gleich wahrscheinlich. Bei niedriger Temperatur werden Konfigurationen mit niedriger Energie bevorzugt. $\\pi_{\\beta, E}(x)$: Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sich das System in der Konfiguration $x$ befindet. Für $E$ kann dann eine Gibbsche Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichtefunktion WDF $$WDF \\propto e&#94;{- \\beta E} = \\prod_k e&#94;{-\\frac{\\lambda_k E_k}{T}}$$ definiert werden.

Methode der kleinsten Quadrate ( Least Squares Methode ) Bei der Lokalisierung mobiler Agenten in einem Raum mit 4 Wänden genügen zwei nicht-parallele Abstandsmessungen. Hat man mehr Messungen, so kann man mit der Methode kleinster Quadrate die beste Position bestimmen. Der Fehler ist dann $e = y - H x$. Damit definiert man das Gütemaß $$G(x) = (y- Hx)&#94;T W&#94;{-1} (y-Hx)$$ wobei $W&#94;{-1}$ eine symmetrisch positiv definite Gewichtungsmatrix ist. Rekursive Methode kleinster Quadrate Wenn bereits einmal die beste Ebene bestimmt wurde will man nicht wieder alles neu berechnen, wenn ein neues Sensorergebnis hinzukommt.

SLAM SLAM ( Simultaneous Location and Mapping ) SLAM ist ein Algorithmus, welcher zugleich eine Karte erstellt und einen mobilen Agenten auf der Karte lokalisiert. Eine Karte sind positionen von Landmarken. Ansätze : Filterung (rekursiv): z.B. Kalman-Filter; EKF , UKF (sigma-Punkte / samples; einfach zu implementieren und liefert häufig bessere Ergebnisse als EKF), Partikelfilter (Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichten werden durch Partikel / samples repräsentiert) $\\Rightarrow$ Schätzen für Zeitschritt Smoothing / Glättung (batch): Nachteile (Rechenaufwendig, erst nach batch ist Ergebnis da, man muss Daten speichern) und Vorteile (komplette Trajektorie, optimale Schätzung selbiger); z.B. Graph-based SLAM Loop Closure : Wenn der Agent wieder an einen Punkt kommt, an dem er bereits war, kann ein Kreis geschlossen werden. Daher können die vorherigen Landmarken im Kreis neu geschätzt werden. Allerdings kann ein falsches Loop Closure zur Divergenz des Filters führen. Herausforderungen : Datenassoziation: Erkennen ob Landmarken die gleichen sind. Komplexität (große Karte) Veränderung der Umgebung: z.B. Auto als Landmarke erkannt; neue Brücke kommt hinzu oder wurde abgerissen Nichtlinearitäten des Prolems Landmarke Ein gut sichtbares / wiedererkennbares Objekt, welches zur Abstandsmessung benutzt werden kann. EKF SLAM EKF SLAM basiert auf dem Extended Kalman Filter. Vereinfachungen : Problem in 2D Feste Zahl von punktförmigen Landmarken Assoziationen bekannt: Landmarken werden zuverlässig erkannt und nicht verwechselt. Zustand $\\mathbf{x}_k = [\\underbrace{x_k, y_k, \\theta_k}_{\\text{Pose des Roboters}}, \\underbrace{m_{1, x}, m_{1, y}}_{\\text{LM 1}}, \\dots, \\underbrace{m_{M, x}, m_{M, y}}_{\\text{LM } M}]$ Dimension von $\\mathbf{x}_k$: $3 + 2 M$. Kovarianz hat $(3+2M)&#94;2$ Elemente, d.h. der Speicheraufwand ist quadratisch in der Zahl der Landmarken. Systemgleichung: $x_{k+1} = a_k (x_k, M_k) + w_k$ $x_{k+1} \\approx A_k x_k + w_k,$ wobei $A_k$ Jaccobi-Matrix von $a_k(x_k, u_k)$ für festes $u_k$ an der Stelle $\\hat{x}_k&#94;e$. Messgleichung: $y_k = h(x_k) + v_k$ In der Regel sind nicht alle Landmarken zugleich sichtbar. In diesem Fall werden Zeilen in der Messabbildung weggelassen. $$y_k = H_k(x_k) + v_k,$$ wobei $H_k$ die Jaccobi-Matrix von $h(x_k)$ an der Stelle $\\hat{x}_k&#94;P$ ist. Particle Filter ( Partikelfilter , Sequential Monte Carlo , SMC ) Idee: Schätze Zustand über Partikel. Ansatz : Sample aus Tranistionsdichte $$f(x_{k+1} | x_k = p_k&#94;1, u_k$$ Implementierung: Rauschen $w_k$ samples $\\rightarrow v_k&#94;1, \\dots, v_k&#94;N$ Propagiere durch $x_{k+1} = a_N(x_N, u_N) + w_N$, d.h. $p&#94;1_{k+1} = a_k (p_k&#94;1, u_k) + v_k&#94;1$ Gewichte bleiben gleich Problem : Viele Partikel $p_k&#94;i$ haben geringes Gewicht $w_k&#94;i$ Lösung : Resampling mit sequential importance resampling (SIR: ziehe $N$ neue Partikel mit Gewichten $\\frac{1}{n}$ aus Menge der alten Partikel, wobei die Wahrscheinlichkeit das Partikel $p_k&#94;i$ zu ziehen gerade $w_k&#94;i$ ist.)

In the last 5 years at university I got to know quite a few, so I want to share my list with you. Discovery Sometimes, I just like to stumble around some papers. I'm not actively searching anything, but just looking for something interesting. In my field of research, gitxiv.com is really interesting for that. But also the recent papers at arXiv and trendingarxiv . I know that a couple of people recently liked arxitics.com and control.kylemcdonald.net/arxiv , but I'm not using that too much. See also: How to find new Papers Search When I'm actively searching for papers where you know keywords, scholar.google.com is the search engine of my choice. academic.microsoft.com could be an interesting alternative. Summaries and Explanations A site which I discovered in the beginning of 2016 is shortscience.org . It gives you the possibility to save and share your summaries of papers. Have a look at my profile if you're interested. The service is still in its early stages, but I like it very much. Scholarpedia.org is a site where you can finde some high-quality explanations. If I remember right, Hinton wrote some articles on Scholarpedia. Of course, Wikipedia is always an option to get introduced to basics. Writing I do the actual writing with Sublime Text . Typesetting The typesetting system of my choice is LaTeX . It produces beautiful results, especially for mathematical formulae. A couple of years ago I wrote some installation instructions . If you need help with something specific, tex.stackexchange.com is really nice. If you're only looking for a symbol to write with LaTeX, I can recommend write-math.com . Other options are available, too. Content If I have questions about academic writing (the content), then academia.stackexchange.com is the site of my choice. Spell- and Stylechecking I use aspell for spellchecking and Academic-Writing-Check to get some ideas where I might improve my writing style. Reference Management I like JabRef as it is in the standard repositories of Ubuntu and works out of the box to manage my references. I use it to fill my BibTeX files and add as much content to papers as I can. JabRef also has some nice options to find / open the paper for yourself. Publishing arxiv.org is one of the best places to publish your paper quickly. Even faster, but a lot less reach has zenodo.org . The nice thing about Zenodo is that you can share datasets, too. Zenodo also gives all your uploads a DOI and offers visitors various ways to cite it. For example, for my HWRT database the BibTeX entry is @misc { thoma _ 2015 _ 50022, author = { Thoma, Martin } , title = { HWRT database of handwritten symbols } , month = jan, year = 2015, doi = { 10.5281/zenodo.50022 } , url = { http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.50022 } } Building a Profile I'm not sure how important this is in Science, but there are some social networks for researchers. ORCiD is one site which aims to give researchers unique numbers so that you can track who wrote what, even if people are in the same field of research and have the same names. It also allows you to add a CV as you can see with my ORCiD . Google Scholar offers a simple version of that, too. See my profile or the profile of Hinton .

Das heißt, der Folgezustand ist nur vom Zustand $x_k$ und der gewählten Aktion $a_k$ abhängig. Im Fall diskreter Zustände ist die Übergangs­wahrscheinlichkeit eine bedingte Zähldichte: $$f(x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k) = P_x(x=x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k)$$ Bei kontinuierlichen Zuständen eine bedingte Wahrscheinlichkeits­dichte: $$f(x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k) = \\frac{\\partial F(x | x_k, a_k)}{\\partial x} |_{x=x_{k+1}}$$ Additive Kostenfunktion $$g_N (x_N) + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} g_k(x_k, a_k)$$ wobei $g_N$ die terminalen Kosten und $g_k$ Schrittkosten genannt werden. Der Zustand ist für jedes $k$ direkt beobachtbar . Vor Anwendung bzw Auswahl einer Aktion $a_k$ zum Zeitpunkt $k$ $$x_{k+1} \\sim P_x(\\cdot | x_k, a_k)$$ wobei $x_k, a_k$ exakt bekannt sind. Nach Anwendung der Aktion $a_k$ zum Zeitpunkt $k+1$ ist $x_{k+1}$ exakt bekannt. Ziel : Minimierung der erwarteten Kosten $$J_{\\pi_{0:N-1}}(x_0) := \\mathbb{E} \\left (g_N(x_k) + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} g_k (x_k, \\pi_k(x_k)) \\right )$$ bzgl. einer Strategie $\\pi_{0:N-1} = (\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_{N-1})$ mit Funktionen $\\pi_k(x_k) = a_k \\in A_k(x_k)$. Policy ( Strategie ) Eine Strategie $\\pi: S \\rightarrow A$ ist die Vorschrift, in welchem Zustand welche Aktion ausgeführt werden soll. Eine Strategie ist ein Plan mit Zustandsrückführung. Präferenzrelation Sei $\\mathcal{X}$ eine Zustandsmenge und $\\geq \\subseteq \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X}$ eine binäre Relation auf $\\mathcal{X}$. $\\geq$ heißt (schwache) Präferenzrelation, wenn gilt: $\\geq$ ist vollständig: $\\forall x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}: x \\geq y \\lor y \\geq x$ $\\geq$ ist transitiv: $\\forall x, y, z \\in \\mathcal{X}: x \\geq y \\land y \\geq z \\Rightarrow x \\leq z$ Indifferenz Zwei Elemente $x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}$ heißen bzgl. einer Präferenzrelation $\\geq \\subseteq \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X}$ indifferent, wenn gilt: $$x \\leq y \\land y \\leq x$$ Nutzenfunktion Sei $\\mathcal{X}$ eine Zustandsmenge und $u: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ eine Funktion. Sei außerdem $\\geq$ eine Präferenzrelation. $u$ heißt eine Nutzenfunktion welche $\\geq$ abbildet, wenn gilt: $$\\forall x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}: x \\geq y \\Leftrightarrow u(x) \\geq u(y)$$ Jede Präferenzrelation hat mindestens eine Nutzenfunktion. Sie ist eindeutig bis auf streng monoton steigende Transformationen. Von-Neumann-Morgenstern Axiome Sei $\\mathcal{X}$ eine Zustandsmenge und $\\mathcal{P}$ die Menge aller Verteilungen $P: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. $\\geq$ ist eine Präferenzrelation Unabhängigkeitsaxiom: Gilt für $P, Q \\in \\mathcal{P}$ die Beziehung $P \\geq Q$, dann gilt auch: $$\\alpha \\cdot P + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot R \\geq \\alpha \\cdot Q + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot R$$ für beliebiges $R \\in \\mathcal{P}$ und beliebiges $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$. Salopp: Störungen $R$ beeinflussen die Präferenz von $P$ und $Q$ nicht. Stetigkeitsaxiom: Für beliebige $P, Q, R \\in \\mathcal{P}$ mit $P > Q > R$ gibt es $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0, 1)$ derart, dass $$\\alpha \\cdot P + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot R > Q > \\beta \\cdot P + (1-\\beta)R$$ gilt. Salopp: Präferenzrelationen sind nicht anfällig gegenüber kleinen Änderungen. Allais Paradoxon Das Allais-Paradoxon ist ein experimentell beobachtbarer Verstoß gegen das Unabhängigkeitsaxiom der wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Entscheidungstheorie. Dieses besagt, dass die Hinzu-/Wegnahme von gemeinsamen Konsequenzen einer Entscheidung die Präferenz des Entscheiders nicht verändern darf. Lotterie 1: a: $P(X = 2500) = 0.33$, $P(X = 2400) = 0.66$, $P(X = 0) = 0.01$ b: $P(X = 2400) = 1$ Lotterie 2: a': $P(X = 2500) = 0.33$, $P(X = 0) = 0.67$ b': $P(X = 2400) = 0.34$, $P(X = 0) = 0.66$ Rationale Entscheidung Folgt eine Präferenzrelation $\\geq$ den Von-Neumann-Morgenstern-Axiomen, so werden Planungsentscheidungen auf der Grundlage von $\\geq$ als rational bezeichnet. Satz der rationalen Entscheidungen (PrPlan-2, Folie 19) Eine Relation $\\geq$ auf $P$ erfüllt die Von-Neumann-Morgenstern Axiome genau dann, wenn eine Funktion $u: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ existiert, sodass $$P \\geq Q \\Leftrightarrow \\mathbb{E}_P (u(x)) \\geq E_Q (u(x))$$ gilt. Die Funktion $u$ ist bist auf affine Transformationen $$c \\cdot u(x) + d \\text{ mit } c>0$$ eindeutig. Kritik an der Nutzentheorie Die Nutzenfunktion kann nicht systematisch konstruiert werden. Die Nutzenfunktion bzw. -theorie stimmt nicht mit der Menschlichen Intuition überein (vgl. Allais Paradoxon ) Verteilungen müssen bekannt sein. Alternative : MinMax Optimierungsproblem Ein allgemeines optimierungsproblem besteht aus einer Optimierungsvariable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n$, für welche ein \"bester\" Parameter gewählt werden soll. Dafür gibt es eine Bewertungsfunktion $f$ (Zielfunktion): $$ \\begin{align} &\\underset{x}{\\operatorname{minimize}}& & f(x) \\\\ &\\operatorname{subject\\;to} & &g;_i(x) \\leq 0, \\quad i = 1,\\dots,m \\\\ &&&h;_i(x) = 0, \\quad i = 1, \\dots,p \\end{align} $$ Siehe auch: Optimization Basics Positiv Definite Matrix Eine Matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}$ heißt positiv definit, wenn $$x&#94;T A x > 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\setminus \\{0\\}$$ Äquivalent gilt: $A$ heißt positiv definit, wenn alle Eigenwerte von $A$ positiv definit sind. Notwendige Bedingung für optimale Lösung $\\nabla f(x) \\overset{!}{=} 0$ Hinreichende Bedingung für optimale Lösung $\\nabla f(x) \\overset{!}{=} 0$ und $\\nabla&#94;2 f(x) =: H_f$ ist positiv definit. Dabei ist $H_f$ die Hessematrix: $$\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial&#94;2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_1} & \\dots & \\frac{\\partial&#94;2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_l}\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial&#94;2 f}{\\partial x_l \\partial x_1} & \\dots & \\frac{\\partial&#94;2 f}{\\partial x_l \\partial x_l} \\end{pmatrix}$$ Allerdings ist diese Bedingung nicht notwendig. Beispielsweise ist für $$f(x) = x&#94;4$$ an der Stelle $x=0$ das globale Minimum. Es gilt: $$\\nabla f(x) = 4 x&#94;3$$ und $$H_f(x&#94;*) = 12 (x&#94;*)&#94;2 = 0$$ Damit ist $H_f(x&#94;*)$ nicht positiv definit und somit keine Entscheidung darüber möglich, ob $x&#94;* = 0$ ein Minimum ist. Ableitungsregeln für Matrizen Es seien im Folgenden $x, a$ Vektoren. $$\\frac{\\partial x&#94;T a}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial a&#94;T x}{\\partial x} = a$$ Es sei $A$ eine quadratische Matrix: $$\\frac{\\partial x&#94;T A}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial A x}{\\partial x} = A$$ $$\\frac{\\partial x&#94;T A x}{\\partial x} = 2 A x$$ Konvexe Optimierungsprobleme Eine Funktion $f: \\mathbb{R}&#94;l \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ heißt konvex , wenn gilt: $$f(\\Theta u + (1 - \\Theta) \\cdot v) \\leq \\Theta f(u) + (1-\\Theta) \\cdot f(v)$$ für beliebige $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;l$ und $\\Theta \\in [0, 1]$ gilt. Salopp : Der Graph der Funktion ist unter der Sekante. Ein Optimierungsproblem heißt konvex , wenn die Gleichungsnebenbedingungen affin und die Zielfunktion sowie die Ungleichungsnebenbedingungen konvex sind. Ein Optimierungsproblem mit konvexer Zielfunktion $f$ hat folgende besonderen Eigenschaften Jedes lokale Optimum ist ein globales Optimum. Ein strikt konvexes Optimierungsproblem hat ein eindeutiges Optimum. Die notwendige Bedingung ist auch hinreichend: Ohne Nebenbedingungen: $\\nabla f(x) \\overset{!}{=} 0$ Mit Nebenbedingungen: $(\\nabla f(x&#94;*))&#94;T \\cdot (x - x&#94;*) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathcal{F}$, wobei $\\mathcal{F}$ eine konvexe Menge ist. Iterativer Abstieg ( Iterative Descent ) Der Iterative Abstieg ist ein numerisches Optimierungsverfahren ohne Nebenbedingungen. Man geht wie folgt vor: Wähle einen Startwert $x_k$ mit $k=0$ beliebig. Wähle einen weiteren Wert $$x_{k+1} = x_k + \\alpha \\cdot d_k$$ wobei $\\alpha > 0$ die Schrittweite (oder Lernrate) genannt wird. $d_k$ ist die Abstiegsrichtung. Weiter zu 2. Wahl der Abstiegsrichtung : Taylor-Reihenentwicklung von $f$ um $x_k$: $$f(x_{k+1}) = f(x_k + \\alpha d_k) = f(x_k) + \\underbrace{\\alpha_k \\nabla f(x_k)&#94;T \\cdot d_k}_{\\text{dominiert } O(\\alpha_k) \\text{ für kleine } \\alpha_k} + O(\\alpha_k)$$ Wähle dann $\\alpha_k \\nabla f(x_k)&#94;T \\cdot d_k < 0 \\Rightarrow$ $f(x_{k+1}) < f(x_k)$, d.h. der Gradient und die Abstiegsrichtung müssen einen Winkel von mehr als 90° einschließen. Häufig wird $d_k = - D_k \\nabla f(x_k)$ gewählt, wobei $D_k$ eine positiv definite Matrix ist. Gradientenabstieg (\"Steilster Abstieg\"): $D_k = I$ Newton-Verfahren: $D_k = H_f&#94;{-1}(x_k)$ wobei $H_f$ die Hesse-Matrix von $f$ ist Wahl der Schrittweite : $\\alpha_k$ konstant $\\alpha_k$ (streng) monoton fallend Liniensuche, d.h. Optimierung bzgl. $\\alpha_k$: $\\alpha_k&#94;* = \\text{arg }\\min_{\\alpha > 0} f(x_k + \\alpha_k d_k)$ Bellman-Gleichungen Eine Bellman-Gleichung stellt die Lösung eines Problems rekursiv dar. Sie zeigt, dass und wie man die Lösung eines komplexen Problems aus Lösungen von Teilproblemen aufbauen kann. Die Belmann-Gleichungen lauten: $$ \\begin{align} J_N(x_n) &= g_N(x_N)\\\\ J_k(x_k) &= \\min_{a_k \\in A_k(x_k)} \\left (g_k(x_k, a_k) + \\mathbb{E}(J_{k+1}(x_{k+1})| x_k, a_k) \\right ) \\end{align} $$ Probleme, für die man eine Bellman-Gleichung aufstellen kann haben optimale Substruktur . Example with the value function: $$V(s) = \\max_{a} (R(s, a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') V(s'))$$ where $V(s)$ is the value of the state $s$, $R(s,a)$ is the reward you get when you apply action $a$ in state $s$, $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor, $T(s, a, s') \\in [0, 1]$ is the transormation matrix which gives you the probability that you will end up in state $s'$ when you apply action $a$ in state $s$. Differentiation Rules $$ \\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial x&#94;T a}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial a&#94;T x}{\\partial x} = a\\\\ \\frac{\\partial x&#94;T A}{\\partial x} &= \\frac{\\partial A x}{\\partial x} = A \\qquad A \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial x&#94;T A x}{\\partial x} &= 2 A x \\qquad A \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n} \\end{align} $$ $Q$-Funktion ( Action-Value function , Quality function ) Die Funktion $Q&#94;\\pi: S \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ gibt den erwarteten Wert einer eines Zustandes $s$ unter der Strategie $\\pi$, wenn die Aktion $a$ ausgeführt wird an. Es gilt: $$Q&#94;\\pi(s, \\pi(s)) = V&#94;\\pi(s)$$ Dynamische Programmierung ( Dynamic Programming ) Dynamische Programmierung ist eine Methode zum Lösen von Optimierungsproblemen. Dabei wird die Tatsache genutzt, dass für jeden initialen Zustand $x_0 \\in \\mathcal{X}$ die optimalen Kosten $J&#94;*(x_0)$ in $$J&#94;*(x_0) = \\min_{\\pi_{0:N-1}} J_{\\pi_{0:N-1}} (x_0)$$ gleich dem Wert $J_0(x_0)$, welcher sich aus dem letzten Schritt der Rekursion $$ \\begin{align} J_N(x_N) &= g_N (x_N)\\\\ J_k(x_k) &= \\min_{a_k \\in A_k(x_k)} \\{g_k (x_k, a_k) + \\mathbb{E}(J_{k+1} (x_{k+1})|x_k, a_k)\\} \\text{ für } k = 0, \\dots, N-1 \\end{align} $$ ergibt. Pseudocode for Dynamic Programming Laufzeitkomplexität: $\\mathcal{O}(N |\\mathcal{X}|&#94;2 |A|)$ 18.05.2016 Endliche Planungsprobleme Hat man einen endlichen Zustandsraum $\\mathcal{X} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n_x\\} \\subsetneq \\mathbb{N}$ und eine endliche Aktionsmenge $A = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n_a\\} \\subsetneq \\mathbb{N}$, in einem Planungsproblem, so spricht man von einem endlichen Planungsproblem. Markov-Kette Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten in einem endlichen Planungsproblem sind gegeben. Die naive Lösung mit Brute-Force ist in $\\mathcal{O}(|A|&#94;{N \\cdot |X|})$. Planungsprobleme nach Horizont $N=1$: Gierige Planung, ein einschrittiges Planungsproblem. Hat geringe Komplexität, aber zukünftige Effekte werden nicht berücksichtig. Bei submodularen Kostenfunktionen kann man die Kosten, die durch die gierige Planung entstehen, abschätzen. $N<\\infty$: Wurde bisher betrachtet und betrifft die meisten Planungsprobleme. Nachteil ist, dass die Strategie $\\pi_k$ zeitinvariant ist. $N = \\infty$: Bei Planungsproblemen mit sehr langem Horizont, wenn ein Ende nicht abzulesen ist. Beispiele sind die kürzeste-Wege-Suche sowie bei Reinforcement Learning. Probleme sind unendliche Kosten und die Zeitabhängigkeit der Schrittkosten und Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten. Discount factor ( Diskontierungsfaktor ) Ein Diskontierungsfaktor $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ encodiert den Bedeutungsverlust zwischen einer direkten Belohnung und einer späteren Belohnung. Es sollte $\\gamma < 1$ gelten um unendliche Belohnungen zu vermeiden. Diskontiertes Planungsproblem Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten und Schrittkosten sind Zeitinvariant, dh. $f_{ij}&#94;k(a) = f_{ij}(a)$ und $g_k(i,a) = g(i, a) \\forall k$. Es gilt die optimale Wertefunktion $J&#94;*$ zu finden, welche durch $$J&#94;*(x_0) = \\min_{\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\dots} (J_{\\pi_0}(x_0))$$ definiert ist. Diese minimiert die erwarteten diskontierten Kosten $$J_{\\pi_0} (x_0) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}(\\alpha&#94;N g(x_N)+ \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} \\alpha&#94;k \\cdot g(x_k, \\pi_k(x_k)))$$ Dabei heißt $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ ein Diskontierungsfaktor . Er verhindert, dass die Kosten unendlich werden. Dies kann man mit DP lösen, indem man eine Vorwärtsrekursion macht: $$ \\begin{align} J_k(1) &= \\min_{a \\in A(i)}(g(i, a) + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{n_x} f_{ij}(a) \\cdot J_{k-1}(j))\\\\ J_0(i) &= g(i) \\end{align} $$ Das ist möglich, da das Problem zeitinvariant ist. Dies kann man durch Indexverschiebung zeigen. Bellman-Operator The Bellman-operator $T$ is a function which takes a function as an argument and returns a function. When $T$ is applied to a cost function $J$, it is defined for each state $i$ as: $$(T J) (i) = \\min_{a \\in A(i)} (g(i,a) + \\alpha \\cdot \\sum_j f_{ij}(a) \\cdot J(j))$$ where $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ is a discount factor. $$T&#94;k J = \\begin{cases}(T(T&#94;{k-1} J)) &\\text{if } k \\geq 1\\\\ J &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$ One can show: $$J&#94;* = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} T&#94;N J \\text{ for arbitrary } J$$ Hence successive applications of the Bellman operator are guaranteed to converge against the global optimum. Strategiebewertung $$(T_\\pi J)(i) = g(i, \\pi(i)) + \\alpha \\cdot \\sum_j f_{ij} (\\pi(i)) \\cdot J(j)$$ Für eine optimale Strategie $\\pi&#94;*$ gilt: $$(T J)(i) = (T_{\\pi&#94;*} J)(i)$$ Wertevektor $$J = (J(1), \\dots, J(nx))&#94;T$$ Kontraktion Eine Funktion $f: M \\rightarrow M$ in einem metrischen Raum $(M, d)$ heißt Kontraktion genau dann, wenn $$\\exists \\lambda \\in [0, 1) \\forall x, y \\in M: d(f(x), f(y)) \\leq \\lambda d(x, y)$$ gilt. Banach'scher Fixpunktsatz Sei $(M, d)$ ein vollständig metrischer Raum und $f$ eine Kontraktion, welche Lipschitz-Stetig ist mit Konstante $0 \\leq \\lambda < 1$. Dann gilt: Es gibt genau einen Fixpunkt $\\xi \\in M$ mit $f(\\xi) = \\xi$. A-priori-Abschätzung: $d(x_n,\\xi)\\le\\frac{\\lambda&#94;n}{1-\\lambda}d(x_0,x_1)$ A-posteriori-Abschätzung: $d(x_n,\\xi)\\le\\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}d(x_{n-1},x_n)$ T-Kontraktion Für beliebige Wertevektoren $J, J'$, eine beliebige Strategie $\\pi$, die Maximums-Norm $d$: $$d(J, J') = \\max_{i \\in \\mathcal{X}} |J(i) - J'(i)|$$ und für alle $k=0,1, \\dots$ gilt: Es existiert ein $\\alpha \\in [0, 1)$ mit $$d(T&#94;k J, T&#94;k J') \\leq \\alpha&#94;k \\cdot d(J, J')$$ $$d(T&#94;k_\\pi J, T&#94;k J') \\leq \\alpha&#94;k \\cdot d (J, J')$$ Das bedeutet, der Bellman-Operator ist eine Kontraktion und laut dem Banachschem Fixpunktsatz gibt es daher einen Fixpunkt. Werte-Iteration ( Value iteration ) $$J&#94;* = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} T&#94;N J$$ where $J&#94;*$ is the optimal value, $T$ is the Bellman operator an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$ is the planning horizon. $g$ is the cost function for each step. Pseudocode for Value iteration algorithm Remark : The value function is usually denoted with $V$, not with $J$. Satz von der Sationären Strategie Für jede stationäre Strategie $\\pi = \\pi_{0:N-1}$ erfüllt der dazugehörige Wertevektor $J_\\pi$ die Fixpunktgleichung $J_\\pi = T_\\pi J_\\pi$. Dabei ist $J_\\pi$ der eindeutige Fixpunkt. Eine sationäre Strategie $\\pi&#94;*$ ist genau dann optimal, wenn $\\pi&#94;*$ $$T J&#94;* = T_{\\pi&#94;*} J&#94;*$$ erfüllt. (Also: Die optimale Strategie ist eine stationäre Strategie) Der Beweis für (1) folgt aus dem Banach'schen Fixpunktsatz. Strategie-Iteration ( Policy iteration ) Man kann beobachten, dass bei der Werte-Iteration die Stategie schneller konvergiert als der Wertevektor. Außerdem ist die Anzahl der Strategien endlich, aber es gibt unendlich viele Wertevektoren. Pseudocode for Policy iteration algorithm wobei $$F(\\pi) = \\begin{pmatrix}f_{11}(\\pi) & \\dots & f_{1 n_x}(\\pi)\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ f_{n_x 1}(\\pi) & \\dots & f_{n_x n_x}(\\pi)\\end{pmatrix}$$ die Transitionsmatrix ist ($f_{ij}(\\pi)$ gibt die Wahrscheinlichkeit an, von Zustand $i$ in Zustand $j$ unter der Strategie $\\pi$ zu wechseln). Außerdem sind der Schrittkostenvektor $g(\\pi)$ und der Wertefunktionsvektor $J$ von folgender Struktur: $$ \\begin{align} g(\\pi) &= \\begin{pmatrix}g(x_1, \\pi(x_1))\\\\ g(x_2, \\pi(x_2))\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ g(x_n, \\pi(x_n))\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ J &= \\begin{pmatrix} J(x_1)\\\\ J(x_2)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ J(x_n) \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align} $$ Die folgenden beiden Schritte werden alternierend ausgeführt: Strategieauswertung: $$V&#94;\\pi(s) \\gets R(s, \\pi(s)) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} T(s, \\pi(s), s') V&#94;\\pi(s')$$ Strategieverbesserung: $$\\pi'(s) \\gets \\text{arg max}_a (R(s, a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} T(s, a, s') V&#94;\\pi(s'))$$ Siehe CMU Value iteration vs Policy iteration Die policy iteration konvergiert in weniger Schritten. Jeder Schritt der policy iteration ist teurer als in der Werteoperation, da die Strategieauswertung die Lösung eines LGS ist (in $\\mathcal{O}(n_x&#94;3)$). Außerdem ist die policy iteration nie für $\\alpha=1$ lösbar (kann auch sonst passieren). Label-Korrektur-Algorithmus Der Label-Korrektur-Algorithmus ist ein Meta-Algorithmus zur kürzeste-Wege-Suche dient. Spezialfälle von diesem sind die Tiefensuche (K ist LIFO-Liste / Stack) und Breitensuche (K ist FIFO-Liste), der Dijkstra-Algorithmus (K ist Priority-Queue), der A*-Algorithmus (K ist Priority-Queue, $h_j$ ist nicht-trivial) sowie Branch & Bound (K ist Priority-Queue, $h_j$ ist nicht-trivial und $m_j$ ist nicht trivial). Pseudocode for the Label correction algorithm Explanation: First `if`: The left hand side is a lower bound to get from start to `v`, to `c` and then to `t`. If this lower bound is not lower than either `u` or the distance to `c` directly, then it will not be part of the optimal solution. Trellis-Diagramm Eine Diagramm welches anzeigt welche Zustände über die Zeit gewählt werden. Pontryagin's Minimum-Prinzip ( Maximumprinzip ) Das Pontryagin'sche Minimum-Prinzip könnte als die russische Variante der Bellman-Gleichungen für deterministische MDPs bezeichnet werden. Es stellt eine notwendige Bedingung an ein Optimum dar. Siehe auch Pontryagin's Minimum Principle by Steven M. LaValle. Pontryagin's maximum principle by Emo Todorov Hamilton-Funktion Die Hamilton-Funktion der Kontrolltheorie stellt eine notwendige Bedingung für die optimale Lösung eines Steuerungsproblems ist. Damit eine Lösung eines Steuerungsprobelms optimal ist, muss die Lösung die Hamilton-Funktion minimieren. Die Aktionen $a_{0:N-1}$ sollen so gewählt werden, dass $$J(x_{0:N}, a_{0:N-1})$$ minimiert wird. Dabei ist $x_k$ der Systemzustand mit $$ \\begin{align} x_0 &= c\\\\ x_{k+1} &= h_k(x_k, a_k) \\qquad \\text{ für } k=0, \\dots, N-1 \\end{align} $$ Daraus ergibt sich das Optimierungsproblem: $$\\begin{align} &\\underset{x_{0:N}, a_{0:N}}{\\operatorname{minimize}}& & J(x_{0:N}, a_{0:N-1}) \\\\ &\\operatorname{subject\\;to} &&x;_{k+1} = h_k(x_k, a_k), \\quad k = 0, \\dots,N-1\\\\ &&&x;_0 = \\text{cost} = c \\end{align}$$ Es ergibt sich die Lagrange-Funktion $$\\mathcal{L}(x_{0:N}, a_{0:N-1}, \\lambda_{0:N}) = J(x_{0:N}, a_{0:N-1}) + (c - x_0) \\cdot \\lambda_0 + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} \\underbrace{\\left (h_k(x_k, a_k) - x_{k+1} \\right )&#94;T \\lambda_{k+1}}_{N \\text{ eindimensionale Nebenbedingungen}}$$ In diesem Fall ist die Hamilton-Funktion $$H_k(x_k, a_k, \\lambda) = g_k(x_k, a_k) + h_k(x_k, a_k)&#94;T \\cdot \\lambda_{k+1},$$ wobei $\\lambda(t)$ Lagrange-Multiplikatoren sind. Insgesamt ergeben sich folgende notwendigen Bedingungen an die optimale Lösung für $k=0, \\dots, N-1$ mit $\\lambda_N = g_N&#94;x(x_N)$ und $x_0$ fest: Zustandsübergänge: $x_{k+1} = h(x_k, a_k)$ $\\lambda_k = g_k&#94;x (x_k, a_k) + h_k&#94;x(x_k, a_k)&#94;T \\cdot \\lambda_{k+1}$ $0 = \\nabla_{a_k} H_k(x_k, a_k, \\lambda_{k+1})$ (oder $a_k = \\text{arg }\\min H_k (x_k, a_k, \\lambda_{k+1})$) Diese (insbesondere das arg min) ist als Pontryagins Minimum-Prinzip bekannt. Lineares Zustandsmodell $$x_{k+1} = A_k + x_k + B_k \\cdot a_k + r_k&#94;{(s)}$$ Linearer Quadratischer Regulator ( LQR ) Der LQR ist ein Regler (Regulator) für einen lineareren Zustandsraum mit quadratischer Kostenfunktion. Ein Reger will typischerweise den Zustand $x = \\vec{0}$ erreichen, wohingegen ein Tracker den aktuellen Zustand bestmöglich schätzen will. Das lineare Zustandsraummodell lautet: $$x_{k+1} = A_k \\cdot x_k + B_k \\cdot a_k + r_k&#94;{(s)}$$ Die zu minimierende Kostenfunktion sei $$\\mathbb{E} \\left ( \\underbrace{x_N&#94;T \\cdot Q_N \\cdot x_N + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} x_k&#94;T \\cdot Q_k \\cdot x_k}_{\\text{Zustandsabhängige Kosten}} + \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} a_k&#94;T \\cdot R_k \\cdot a_k}_{\\text{aktionsabhängige Kosten}} \\right )$$ Dabei sind die Gewichtungsmatrizen $Q_k, Q_N, R_k$ symmetrisch und positiv definit. Auch die cost-to-go Matrix $P_{k+1}$ ist symmetrisch und positiv definit. Die optimale Lösung für dieses Problem lautet: $$a_k&#94;* = \\underbrace{-{(R_k + B_k&#94;T P_{k+1} B_k)}&#94;{-1} \\cdot B_k&#94;T \\cdot P_{k+1} \\cdot A_k}_{\\text{Verstärkungsmatrix } L_k} x_k$$ wobei $P_k$ durch die iterative Riccati-Gleichung gefunden wird: $$ \\begin{align} P_N &= Q_N\\\\ P_k &= A_k&#94;T \\left ( \\underbrace{P_{k+1} - \\overbrace{P_{k+1} B_k (B_k&#94;T P_{k+1} B_k + R_k)&#94;{-1}}&#94;{\\text{see Kalman gain}} B_k&#94;T P_{k+1}}_{\\text{see error estimate update in Kalman filter}} \\right ) A_k + Q_k \\end{align}$$ Alternativ kann man $P_k$ also so ausdrücken: $$\\begin{align} P_k &= A_k&#94;T \\left ( (I-K_k B_k&#94;T) P_{k+1} \\right ) A_k + Q_k\\\\ K_k &= P_{k+1} B_k (B_k&#94;T P_{k+1} B_k + R_k)&#94;{-1} \\end{align}$$ PWLC ( Piece-wise linear and Concave ) Siehe Basics of Solving POMDPs Sicherheitsäquivalenz ( Certainty Equivalence ) Die Sicherheitsäquivalenz besagt, dass im Fall eines linearen Modells mit einer quadratischen Zielfunktion und additivem Rauschen die optimale Lösung des Kontroll-Problems die Gleiche ist, wie wenn das Rauschen nicht vorhande wäre. Anders gesagt: Die Verstärkungsmatrix $L_k$ und somit die Strategie $\\pi_k&#94;*$ sind unabhängig vom Rauschen $r_k&#94;{(s)}$. Die selbe optimale Strategie ergibt sich bei Betrachtung des korrespondierendne deterministischen Zustandsraummodel $$x_{k+1} = A_k x_k + B_k a_k$$ welchem das Rauschen $r_k&#94;{(s)}$ durch dessen Erwartungswert $\\mathbb{E}(r_k&#94;{(s)}) = 0$ ersetzt ist. $\\Rightarrow$ Deterministisches Problem POMDPs Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) Die Messungen sind unsicherheitsbehaftet. Das Planungsproblem ist wie folgt definiert: Zustand: Der Agent erhält nur noch Beobachtungen / Messungen des Zustands. Probleme dabei sind: Rauschen von Sensoren Indirekt: Position ist interessant, aber man kann z.B. mit GPS nur die Laufzeiten ermitteln. Niederdimensional: Messgröße ist niedrigdimensonaler als die interessierte Größe. Erst durch mehrere Messungen gelangt man an die interessante Größe. Ein POMDP ist ein MDP mit folgenden Unterschieden: Initialzustand $x_0$ ist Zufallsvariable mit Verteilung $P(x_0)$. Beobachtungen / Messungen $z_k \\in Z$ gemäß der bedingten Verteilung $$z_k \\sim P(\\cdot | x_k, a_{k-1})$$ (Beobachtungswahrscheinlichkeit) Diskrete Beobachtungen $\\rightarrow$ bedingte Zähldichte $$f(z_k | x_k a_{k-1}) = P(z=z_k | x_k, a_{k-1})$$ Kontinuierliche Beobachtungen $\\rightarrow$ bedingte Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichte $$f(z_k | x_k, a_{k-1}) = \\frac{\\partial f(z | x_k, a_{k-1})}{\\partial z} |_{z=z_k}$$ Minimierung der erwarteten Kosten $$J_{\\pi_{0:N-1}}(\\square) = \\mathbb{E}(g_N (x_n) + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} g_n(x_k, \\pi_k(\\square)))$$ Reformulierung als MDP: Problem: keine vollständige Information über den Zustand $x_k$, aber Zugriff auf Beobachtungen Idee: Definieren eines neuen Zustands (Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}$, engl. Information state), welcher direkt zugänglich ist, alle verfügbaren Informationen über $x_k$ zum Zeitpunkt $k$ enthält Der Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}$ enthält alle Beobachtungen: $$\\mathcal{I} = (z_0, \\dots, z_k, a_{0}, \\dots, a_{k-1}) \\text{ für } k=0, \\dots, N-1$$ Der Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}_k$ beschreibt die zeitliche Entwicklung des Agenten. Mit $P(x_0)$ und $\\mathcal{I}_k$ ist sämtliche Information gegeben um zum Zeitpunkt $k$ eine Planungsentscheidung zu treffen. Das korrespondierende MDP wird Informations-MDP genannt. Das zu lösende dynamische Programm lautet: $$J_N(\\mathcal{I}_N) = \\mathbb{E}(g_N(x_N) | \\mathcal{I}_N)$$ $$J_k(\\mathcal{I}_k) = \\min_{a_k} (\\mathbb{E}_{x,z}(g_k(x_k, a_k) + J_{k+1}(\\mathcal{I}_k, z_{k+1}, a_k)(\\mathcal{I}_k, a_k))) \\text{ für } k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$$ Die Lösung ist eine öptimale Strategie $\\pi_k&#94;* (\\mathcal{I}_k) = a_k&#94;*$ Nur in Ausnahmefällen geschlossen lösbar, z.B. lineare Modelle. Statistik Seien $S=\\{z_1, \\dots, z_n\\}$ Stichproben (Samples) einer Zufallsvariablen $z \\sim P(z | \\Theta)$ mit unbkanntem Parameter $\\Theta$. Eine Statistik ist eine Funktion $T(S)=t$, welche zwar von $S$, nicht aber von $\\Theta$ abhängt. Konstante Funktionen, minimum, maximum, durschschnitt, median, ... Hinreichende Statistik (engl. sufficient statistic ) Ziel: Kompression, d.h. Darstellung von $\\mathcal{I}_k$ von geringer Dimension. Eine Statistik $T$ heißt hinreichend für $\\Theta$, wenn keine weitere Statstik auf $S$ existiert, welche zusätzliche Informationen über $\\Theta$ liefert. Ist $T(S) = t$ gegeben, dann liefert die volle Kentnis von $S$ keine Zusatzinformation über $\\Theta$. Beispiel: Der Stichprobenmittelwert $\\hat{z}$ von $n$ unabhängigen Stichproben $z_i$ einer normalverteilten Zuvallsvariabeln $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$ ist eine hinreichende Statistik für $\\mu$. Bayes'scher Schätzer Suppose an unknown parameter $\\theta$ is known to have a prior distribution $\\pi$. Let $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\widehat{\\theta}(x)$ be an estimator of θ (based on some measurements $x$), and let $L(\\theta,\\widehat{\\theta})$ be a loss function, such as squared error. The Bayes risk of $\\widehat{\\theta}$ is defined as $E_\\pi(L(\\theta, \\widehat{\\theta}))$, where the expectation is taken over the probability distribution of $\\theta$: this defines the risk function as a function of $\\widehat{\\theta}$. An estimator $\\widehat{\\theta}$ is said to be a Bayes estimator if it minimizes the Bayes risk among all estimators. Equivalently, the estimator which minimizes the posterior expected loss $E(L(\\theta,\\widehat{\\theta}) | x)$ for each x also minimizes the Bayes risk and therefore is a Bayes estimator. Source: Wikipedia In general, the Bayes estimator has no closed-form solution. The Extended Kalman filter is a Bayes estimator. See also: Recursive Bayesian estimation Bayes Filter Verteilungs-MDP ( Belief-state MDP ) POMDPs haben äquivalente Verteilungs-MDPs. Dabei wird eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung für den aktuellen Zustand angegeben. Verschiedene Verteilungen werden diskretisiert und als Zustände angesehen. Dann kann jeder beliebige MDP-Lösungsalgorithmus auch für POMDPs verwendet werden. Siehe: POMDPs by Geoff Hollinger. Lineare Planungsprobleme in POMDPs Zustandsraummodell (Systemmodell): $$x_{k+1} = A_k \\cdot x_k + B_k \\cdot a_k + r_k&#94;{(s)}$$ Messmodell (Sensormodell): $$z_k = H_k \\cdot x_k + r_k&#94;{(m)}$$ $r_k&#94;{(s)}, r_k&#94;{(m)}$ sind normalverteilte Rauschterme: $$f_k&#94;x(x_k) = N(x_k; \\hat{x}_k, C_k&#94;x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|2 \\pi C_k&#94;x|}} \\exp(-1/2 (x_k - \\hat{x}_k)&#94;T (C_k&#94;x)&#94;{-1} (x_k - \\hat{x}_k))$$ mit Mittelwert $\\hat{x}_k$ und Kovarianzmatrix $C_k&#94;x$ $X = \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_x}, A=\\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_k}, Z=\\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_z}$ Ziel: Überführung des Zustandes $x_0$ in Zielzustand $x_t = [0, ..., 0]&#94;T$ durch Minimierung der quatratischen Kostenfunktion $\\mathbb{E}(x_N&#94;T Q_N x_n + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} (x_k&#94;T Q_k x_k + a_k&#94;T R_k a_k) | I_N)$ mit symmetrisch, positiv definiten Gewichtungsmatrizen $Q_N, Q_k, R_k$ und Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}_N$. Dies ist ein lineares, quadratisches Gauß'sches Planungsprobelm (LQG) Planer besteht aus 2 Komponenten: Zustandsschätzer Strategie Zustandsschätzer: Annahme: beliebige Aktionsfolge $a_{0:N-1}$ gegeben: Kalman-Filter Prädiktion ($k \\rightarrow k+1$) Gegeben: A posteriori Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichte $f_a&#94;e(x_k) = N(x_k; \\hat{x}_k&#94;e, C_k&#94;e) = P(x_k | I_k)$ Gesucht: prädizierte Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichte $f_{k+1}&#94;p(x_{k+1}) = N(x_{k+1}; \\hat{x}_k&#94;P, C_k&#94;P) = P(x_{k+1} | I_k, a_k)$ Berechnung der Parameter: Mittelwert: $\\hat{x}_{k+1}&#94;{(P)} = A_k \\hat{x}_k&#94;e + B_k a_k$ Kovarianzmatrix: $P_k&#94;{(P)} = A_k P_k&#94;e A_k&#94;T + C_k&#94;{(s)}$ Filterschritt ($k \\overset{Z_k}{\\rightarrow} k$) Gegeben: prädizierte Dichte $f_k&#94;P(x_k)$, Messung $z_k$ Gesucht: a-posteriori Dichte $f_k&#94;e(x_k)$ Berechnung der Parameter: Mittelwert: $\\hat{x}_k&#94;e = \\hat{x}_k&#94;P + K_k (z_k - H_k \\hat{x}_k&#94;{(P)})$ Kovarianzmatrix: $P_k&#94;e = C_k&#94;{(P)} - K_k H_k C_k&#94;{(P)}$ Kalman-Gain: $K_k = P_k&#94;{(P)} H_k&#94;T (H_k C_k&#94;{(P)} H_k&#94;T + C_k&#94;{(m)})&#94;{-1}$ Insgesamt: Geschlossene Berechnung der Zustandsverteilung Kalman-Filter erfüllt BLUE -Eigenschaft Regelkreis ( Control system ) Ein Regelkreis ist ein technisches System, welches einen Zielzustand anstrebt. Open-loop Planung ( OL Planung ) Unter einem Open-loop Control system (offener Regelkreis) versteht man ein technisches System welches ohne Zustandsrückführung, also ohne Messung des Zustands nachdem die Regelung begonnen wurde, arbeitet. Beispiele sind Spühlmaschinen und Rasensprenger. In der Open-loop Planung wird ein optimaler Plan bestimmt: $$a_{0:N-1}&#94;* = \\text{arg}\\min_{a_{0:N-1}} \\mathbb{E}\\{g_N (x_N) + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{N-1} g_k (x_k, a_k)\\}$$ Da der Plan \"blind\", also ohne Zustandsrückführung, angwedet wird sind deterministische Planungsverfahren anstelle von DP anwendbar. Closed-loop Planung ( CL Planung ) Unter einem Closed-loop control system (geschlossenem Regelkreis) versteht man ein technisches System welches mit Zustandsrückführung, also mit Messung des Zustands während der Regelung, arbeitet. Beispiele sind System im Auto zum halten der Geschwindigkeit oder Rasensprenger welche die Feuchtigkeit überprüfen. Closed-loop Planung kann mit dynamischer Programmierung gelöst werden. Geschlossene Lösung nur in Ausnahmefällen, sonst numerische Lösungsverfahren. In der closed-loop Planung wird eine optimale Strategie bestimmt. Open-Loop-Feedback Planung ( OLF Planung ) OLF-Planung ist ein Mittelweg zwischen OL-Planung und CL-Planung. Es wird der aktuelle Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}_k$ verwendet um $P(x_k | I_k)$ zu bestimmen. Dann wird mittels OL-Planung der optimale Plan $a_{k:N-1}&#94;*$ bestimmt. Die OLF-Planung ist eine Folge von $N$ OL-Planungsschritten: $P(x_k | I_k)$ wird berechnet. $a_{k:N-1}&#94;* \\gets \\arg \\min \\mathbb{E}(g_N(x_N) + \\sum_{i=k}&#94;{N-1} g_i(x_i, a_i) | I_k)$ Wende $a_{k:N-1}&#94;*$ und gehe wieder zu 1 Es gilt: $$J_{CL} \\leq J_{OLF} \\leq J_{OL}$$ Modellprädiktive Planung OLF-Planung über kürzeren, aber wandernden Horizont $M \\ll N$ Ablauf (on-line): Berechnung von $P(x_k | I_k)$ Berechnung von $a_{k:M-1}&#94;*$ durch Minimierung von $$\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_{i=k}&#94;{k+M-1} g_i(x_i, a_i) | \\mathcal{I}_k)$$ Anwendung von $a_k&#94;*$, zurück zu 1. Eigenschaften: Effiziente Planung für große $N$, insbesondere für $N=a$ Verlängerung von $M$ führt nicht notwendigerweise zu besseren Planungsergebnissen; d.h. $M$ ist kein Trade-off zwischen Qualität und Komplexität. Hier wird der Plan aktualisiert; OLF minimiert die Kosten garantiert stärker als OL-Planung (gleichheit im deterministischen Fall) Linearisierung ( Extended Kalman Filter , EKF ) Siehe auch: EKF . Bedingte Differentielle Entropie $$H(x|z, a) = - \\int_z f(z|a) \\cdot \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} f(x|z, a) \\cdot \\log (f(x|z, a)) \\mathrm{d}x \\mathrm{d} z$$ Die differentielle Entropie erweitert die Schannon-Entropie auf den kontinuierlichen Fall. Unschön ist, dass sie negativ werden kann. Sie bewertet Unsicherheit anhand der \"räumlichen\" Konzentration von Wahrscheinlichkeitsmassen. Sensoreinsatzplanung Das Ziel der Sensoreinsatzplanung ist es, die Sensoren so zu positionieren / auszurichten / konfigurieren, dass der Informationsgewinn maximiert wird. Gegeben Kontinuierlicher Zustandsraum $\\mathcal{X}$ Kontinuierlicher Beobachtungsraum $\\mathcal{Z}$ Endliche Menge der Konfigurationen $A$ Zustandsübergang: $f(x_{k+1} | x_k)$ bzw. $x_{k+1} = p_k(x_k, w_k)$ Messmodell: $f(z_k | x_k, a_k)$ bzw. $z_k = h_k(x_k, a_k, v_k)$ Schrittkosten $g_k$, welche den Informationsgewinn durch die Wahl einer geeigneten Konfiguration $a_k$ bewerten. Dabei kann man z.B. Kovarianzbasiert vorgehen, also die räumliche Ausdehnung der Kovarianzmatrix als Bewertungsgrundlage verwenden. Die Spur der Kovarianzmatrix ist proportional zum Umfang, die Determinante ist proportional zur Fläche. Alternativ kann man Informationstheoretisch vorgehen. So ist die bedingte differentielle Entropie : $$H(x | z, a) = - \\int_{\\mathcal{Z}} f(z | a) \\cdot \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} f(x|z,a) \\cdot \\log f(x | z,a) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{d} z$$ (vgl. Entropie- vs Varianz ) Ein weiteres Maß für informationstheoretische Kosten ist die Transinformation (engl. Mutual information): $$ \\begin{align} T(x; z) &= \\int_{\\mathcal{Z}} \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} f(x, z) \\cdot \\log \\frac{f(x,z)}{f(x) \\cdot f(z)} \\mathrm{d}z \\mathrm{d}x\\\\ &= H(x) - H(x|z) \\geq 0 \\end{align} $$ Keine Terminalen Kosten Das Problem wird nun wie folgt gelöst: Informationsvektor $\\mathcal{I}_k = (a_{0:k}, z_{0:k})$ Dynamisches Programm $J_N = 0$ $$J_k(P(x_k | \\mathcal{I}_{k-1})) = \\min_{a_k} \\left \\{g_k(x_k, a_k) + \\mathbb{E}_{z_k} \\left \\{J_{k+1} (P(x_{k+1} | \\mathcal{I}_k) | I_{k-1} ) \\right \\} \\right \\}$$ Im Allgemeinen gibt es hier keine geschlossene Lösung. Informationstheoretische Kosten gehen im linearen Planungsfall in Kovarianz-basierte Kosten über. Siehe z.B. Entropie: $$H(x_k | z_k, a_k) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log |2 \\pi \\underbrace{Cov(x_k | a_k)}_{C_k&#94;e}| \\approx |Cov(\\cdot | \\cdot)|$$ In der Sensoreinsatzplanung liefern Open-Loop und Closed Loop Verfahren, gegeben die initiale Verteilung $P(x_0)$, die selben Kosten. Daher wird Open-Loop-Planung verwendent. Das heißt, der optimale Plan $a_{0:N-1}&#94;*$ wird mittels deterministischer Planung (also Kürzeste-Wege-Suche), bestimmt. $g_i(x_i, a)$: Schrittkosten Der Suchbaum hat $|A|&#94;N$ Pfade. (0-1 Programme) Monotonie der Riccati-Gleichung (Siehe Folie 4 ) Sei $$V_k(\\Lambda, C) := C_k&#94;w + (A_k - \\Lambda \\cdot H_k) C \\cdot (A_k - \\Lambda H_k)&#94;T + \\Lambda C_k&#94;v V&#94;T$$ mit $$\\Lambda = K_k = A_k C H_k&#94;T (H_k C H_k&#94;T)&#94;{-1} \\text{ und } C = C_k&#94;P$$ gilt $V_k = S_k$, da $$ \\begin{align} V(K, C&#94;P) &= C&#94;W + (A - KH) C&#94;P (A-KH)&#94;T + KC&#94;V K&#94;T\\\\ &= C&#94;W + AC&#94;P A&#94;T - KH C&#94;P A&#94;T + KHC&#94;P H&#94;T K&#94;T - A C&#94;P H&#94;T K&#94;T KC&#94;v K&#94;T\\\\ &= C&#94;W + AC&#94;P A&#94;T - KH C&#94;P A&#94;T - AC&#94;P H&#94;T K&#94;T + K (HC&#94;P H&#94;T + C&#94;v) K&#94;T \\cdot A&#94;CP H {(H C&#94;P H&#94;T + C&#94;V)}&#94;{-1}\\\\ &= C&#94;W + AC&#94;P A&#94;T - KH C&#94;P A&#94;T = S_k(C&#94;P) \\end{align} $$ Weiterhin ist $\\Lambda = K_k$ das Minimum von $V_k$ für gegebenes $C$, da der Kalman-Filter der optimale Schätzer für lineare Modelle ist. Mit $\\tilde{K}_k = A_k \\tilde{C} H_k&#94;T {(H_k \\bar{C} H_k&#94;T + C_k&#94;v)}&#94;{-1}$ gilt $$S_k(C) = V_k(K_k, C) \\prec V_k(\\bar{K}_k, C) \\prec V_k(\\bar{K}_k, \\bar{C}) = S_k(\\tilde{C})$$ Siehe auch: Algebraic Riccati equation , LQR Approximative Planung Abbildung auf lineare Sensoreinsatzplanung mittels Linearisierung und Modellprädiktiver Planung Linearisierung Hier werden Nominalwerte $\\bar{x}_{k:N-1}$ benötigt. Da die Aktion nur die Messgleichung, nicht jedoch die Systemgleichung betrifft können die $$\\bar{x}_k = \\hat{x}_k&#94;P; \\qquad \\bar{x}_{k+1} = p_k(\\bar{x}_k, 0)$$ Anschließend wird linearisiert. Ablauf Nach Messung: (approximative) Berechnung ovn $P(x_k | I_k)$ bzw. $P(x_{k+1} | I_k)$ z.B. mittels EKF.

Problem Die Kostenfunktion $g_k$ kann unbekannt sein. Das Modell, das heißt die Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten $P(x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k)$ können unbekannt sein. Dies wird durch ein Zusammenspiel aus lernen und planen gelöst. Man lernt also aus Erfahrung und Interaktion mit der Umwelt . Definition MDP mit folgenden Unterschieden: (2) Zeithorizont: $N = \\infty$ für fortlaufende Aufgaben $N < \\infty$ für episodische Aufgaben (diese haben einen terminaler Zustand) (5) Keine Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten gegeben (6) Belohnungen (reward) $r_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ für Aktion $a_k$ in Zustand $x_k$ mit Nachfolgezustand $x_{k+1}$. $$r_k = g_k(x_k, a_k, x_{k+1})$$ wobei $g_k$ unbekannt. (8) Ziel: Maximierung der erwarteten Belohnung über die Zeit. $$J(x_k) = \\mathbb{E}(R_k | x_k)$$ Fortlaufender Zeithorizont: $R_k = \\sum_{t=0}&#94;\\infty \\gamma&#94;t r_{k+t}$ mit Diskontierungsfaktor $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$ Episodischer Zeithorizont: $R_k = \\sum_{i=0}&#94;N r_{k+i},$ wobei $N$ unbekannt ist. Beispiele Beliebige Computerspiele Spielen Stabilisierung eines inversen Pendels Eigenschaften und Besonderheiten des RLs Prinzipien des biologischen Lernens (Negatives / Positives Verstärken) Intrinsische Motivation etwas erreichen zu wollen: Abstraktion als Kosten- / Belohnungsfunktion, die es über die Zeit zu min. / max. gilt. Exploratives Lernen Unterschied zu \"klassischen\" Lernverfahren: Lernen erfolgt unüberwacht und explorativ durch aktive Interaktion mit der Umwelt. RL kombiniert Aspekte der Planung mit Lernmethodik. Da RL unüberwacht ist erfolgt die Entscheidung aufgrund eigener Erfahrung. Dynamisches Programmieren ist nicht anwendbar, da das Modell und die Kosten unbekannt sind. Die optimale Strategie wird aus Erfahrung approximiert. Unterscheidungsmerkmale von RL-Problemtypen Horizont: Fortlaufend, z.B. in Regelungstechnik das inverse Pendel Episodisch in Spielen Approximation / lernen: On-policy: Dieselbe Strategie wird zugleich verbessert und angewandt. Off-policy: verwendet 2 Strategien Strategie 1: erzeugen von Aktionen Strategie 2: wird verbessert Zustands- und Aktionsraum: Diskret Kontinuierlich Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten / Kosten Modellfreie Verfahren: Lernen nur die optimale Strategie Modelllernende Verfahren: Lernen von Strategie und Modell Lösungsansätze für RL-Probleme Wertefunktionsbasiert: Schätzen die Wertefunktion / $Q$-Funktion aus Lernstichproben (Monte Carlo (MC); Temporal Difference (TD), Verantwortlichkeitsspur (eligibility trace, credit assignment); Verwendung von Funktionsapproximatoren) Modelllernende Methoden Strategiesuche (Policy search; Funktionsapproximatoren - neuronale Netze) Episode A run through an MDP from a start state to an end state. Monte-Carlo Methoden Idee : Erlernen einer Strategie aus Beispielepisoden. Approximation des Erwartungswertes durch Stichproben (Samples) $$\\mathbb{E}(R) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}&#94;N r_k =: \\bar{R}_N,$$ wobei $r_k$ die Belohnung im Zeitschritt $k$ ist. Rekursiv: $$\\bar{R}_{N+1} = \\bar{R}_N + \\frac{1}{N+1} (r_{N+1} - \\bar{R}_N) \\text{ mit } \\bar{R}_1 = r_1$$ Monte-Carlo Methoden funktionieren ausschließlich auf episodischen Problemen (d.h mit Ende), wie z.B. Spielen, da die Aktualisierung nach Beendigung einer Episode stattfindet. Gegeben: Strategie $\\pi$ Gesucht: Wertefunktion $J_\\pi(x)$ Ablauf: Für beliebigen Initialzustand erzeuge Episode mittels $\\pi$ Für jeden Zustand $x$ in Episode: $R \\gets$ kummulative Belohnung ab 1. Vorkommen von $x$ (First-visit, es gibt auch every-visit) $n(x) \\gets n(x) + 1$ $J_\\pi(x) \\overset{(*)}{\\gets} J_\\pi (x) + \\frac{1}{n(x)} (R - J_\\pi (x))$ Konvergiert für unendliche Anzahl an Episoden. Vorteile: Aufwand ist unabhängig von der Anzahl der Zustände (genauso wie Partikelfilter). Einschränkungen auf Teilmenge von $\\mathcal{X}$ möglich. Nachteile / Einschränkungen: Ist nur auf episodische Probleme anwendbar Monte Carlo RL Idee: Schätzen der $Q$-Funktion $Q(x, a)$. Pseudocode for Policy Iteration Für gegebene Episode: Aktualisierung der $Q$-Funktion für alle besuchten Zustände $x$ und gewählte Aktionen $a$. Verbesserung der Strategie für alle besuchten Zustände. Problem: pro Zustand wird nur eine Aktion bewertet. Das führt nur auf sehr lokalen Bereichen zu einer Strategieverbesserung. Exploration vs. Exploitation The exploration vs. exploitation problem is that an agent in a reinforcement learning setting can either try to improve his strategy in a part where he already knows how to behave or he can try to explore the world and potentially find much better (or much worse) strategies. Exploit what is already known to obtain rewards, but explore in order to choose better actions in the future. There are the following exploration strategies: Exploring Starts $\\varepsilon$-Greedy Strategy Softmax Strategy $\\varepsilon$-decreasing Strategy $\\varepsilon$-first Strategy Adaptive $\\varepsilon$-greedy Strategy Exploring Starts Jedes Zustands-Aktions-Paar gleichwahrscheinlich als Startwert für Episode. Vorteil: Führt zu einer deterministischen Strategie Nachteil: Für viele reale Systeme nicht realisierbar (z.B. Roboter kann nicht bei voller Kraft starten). Probabilistische Strategie Eine probabilistische Strategie $\\pi$ ist definiert als eine Funktion, welche für einen Zustand $x$ und eine Aktion $a$ die Wahrscheinlichkeit wiedergibt, dass $a$ im Zustand $x$ ausgeführt wird: $$\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$$ $$\\pi(x, a) = P(a | x)$$ $\\varepsilon$-Greedy Strategy The $\\varepsilon$-greedy exploration strategy is a probabilistic strategy: Explore $\\varepsilon$% of the time. Otherwise, follow what you currently believe is best. gierige Aktion: Aktion mit höchster erwarteter Belohnung: $$a&#94;+ = \\arg \\max_a Q(x,a)$$ erhält höchste Wahrscheinlichkeit: $$\\pi(x, a&#94;*) = 1 - \\varepsilon + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|A(x)|}$$ nicht-gierige Aktionen: $\\pi(x, a) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|A(x)|}$ mit $0 < \\varepsilon \\ll 1$ Vorteil: Kein Festlegen auf suboptimale Aktion Nachteil: Wahl von $\\varepsilon$ problematisch $\\varepsilon$-greedy MC policy iteration ist on-policy Softmax-Strategie Rangfolge entsprechend der Wertigkeit der Aktionen $$\\pi(x, a) = \\frac{e&#94;{Q(x, a) / \\tau}}{\\sum_a e&#94;{Q(x,a) / \\tau}} \\text{ mit \"Temperatur\"} \\tau > 0$$ Die generierte Verteilung nennt sich Gibbs- oder auch Boltzmann-Verteilung. $\\tau$ groß: $Q(x,a) / \\tau$ wird klein, d.h. die Aktionen werden ähnlich wahrscheinlich gewählt. $\\tau$ klein: Die Aktionen werden mit deutlich unterschiedlicher wahrscheinlichkeit gezogen. $\\tau \\rightarrow 0$: nahezu deterministische, gierige Strategie. Vorteil gegenüber $\\varepsilon$-greedy: Rangfolge bei Auswahl. Nachteil gegenüber $\\varepsilon$-greedy: Wahl von $\\tau$ wird of als schwieriger angesehen als die Wahl von $\\varepsilon$. $\\varepsilon$-decreasing Strategy Explore $\\varepsilon$% of the time. Otherwise, follow what you currently believe is best. Reduce $\\varepsilon$ over time. $\\varepsilon$-first Strategy Explore for $\\varepsilon$ steps and then do what you think is best. Adaptive $\\varepsilon$-greedy Strategy Explore $\\varepsilon$% of the time. Otherwise, follow what you currently believe is best. Reduce $\\varepsilon$ based on what you learn. GLIE-Strategie GLIE ( G reedy in the l imit with i nfinite e xploration) bezeichnet eine Damit eine Strategie GLIE ist, muss erfüllt sein: Alle $(x, a)$-Paare werden unendlich oft besucht Strategie konvergiert zu einer gierigen Strategie, d.h. $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\pi(x, a&#94;*) = 1 \\text{ für } \\arg \\max_a a(x, a)$$ Beispiel bei $\\varepsilon$-greedy Strategie: $\\varepsilon$ mit Zeit abklingen lassen $\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{n(x)}$ mit $\\varepsilon \\in (0, 1)$ und $n(x)$ zählt wie häufig der Zustand $x$ besucht wurde. Fazit Monte Carlo-Verfahren Vorteile Erlernen der optimalen Strategie ohne Modellwissen möglich, sofern GLIE-Strategien verwendet werden Auch anwendbar, wenn die Markov-Annahme nicht gilt, da kein Bootstrapping Nachteile: Allgemeine Konvergenzeigenschaften (noch) nicht formal bewiesen. (Schon für Strategiebewertung, nicht aber für RL) Funktioniert nur für episodische RL-Probleme Temporal Difference Verfahren ( TD ) TD-Verfahren nutzen die zeitliche Differenz zweier Schätzungen eines Zustandwertes. Die Aktualisierungen sind nach jedem Zustandwechsel. Das heißt, im Gegesatz zu MC-Verfahren, sind TD-Verfahren für Episodische und fortlaufende RL-Probleme geignet. Unterschiedliche Schätzung: $$ \\begin{align} J_\\pi(x) &= \\mathbb{E}(R_k | x_k = x) \\tag{1}\\\\ &= \\mathbb{E}(r_k + \\gamma \\sum_{i=0}&#94;\\infty \\gamma&#94;i \\cdot r_{k+i} | x_k = x)\\tag{2} \\end{align} $$ MC-Verfahren ganz (1) mittels Stichprobenfolge. TD-Verfahren schätzen die Summe in (2) durch eine Stichprobe $r_k$. TD-Strategiebewertung Erinnerung an DP-Strategiebewertung: $$J_\\pi(x_k) \\gets r_k(x_k, \\pi (x_k)) + \\alpha \\sum_{x_{k+1}} P(x_{k+1} | x_k, \\pi(x_k)) \\cdot J_\\pi (x_{k+1})$$ Allerdings ist $P( \\cdot | x_k, a)$ unbekannt. Daher wird es mittels einer einzelnen Stichprobe $(x_k, r_k, x_{k+1})$ geschätzt und ein Mittelwert zwischen dem aktuellen Wert und der Schätzung erstellt. $$J_\\pi(x_k) \\gets (1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\underbrace{J_\\pi(x_k)}_{\\text{aktueller Wert}} + \\alpha \\cdot \\underbrace{(\\underbrace{r_k + \\gamma \\cdot J_\\pi(x_{k+1})}_{\\text{erwarteter Wert}} - J_\\pi(x_k))}_{\\text{zeitliche Differenz}}$$ Konvergenz bei variabler Schrittweite $\\alpha = \\alpha_k$ (Lernrate) falls $$\\sum_{k=1}&#94;\\infty \\alpha_k = \\infty \\text{ und } \\sum_{k=1}&#94;\\infty \\alpha_k&#94;2 < \\infty$$ Eine typische Wahl ist $\\alpha(x, a) = \\frac{1}{1+ m(x, a)},$ wobei $m(x, a)$ die Anzahl der Besuche von $(x, a)$ ist. Einschritt-TD-Verfahren SARSA ist ein Einschritt-TD-Verfahren. Die Aktualisierung nach der Ausführung von $a_k$ liefert Belohnung $r_k$ und Nachfolgezustand $x_{k+1}.$ ABER Folgeaktion $a_{k+1}$ wird benötigt. SARSA ( State Action Reward State Action ) SARSA is a temporal difference learning algorithm which updates the $Q$-function: $$Q(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow (1-\\alpha) \\cdot Q(s_t,a_t) + \\alpha [r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\cdot Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})]$$ where $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ is the learning rate and $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor. As SARSA chooses $a_{k+1}$ according to the policy $\\pi$ it is an on-policy algorithm, in contrast to $Q$-learning. Pseudocode for SARSA $Q$-Learning $Q$-Learning ist ein TD-Vefahren um ohne Modell ein Reinforcement-Learning Problem zu lösen. $$Q(x_k, a_k) \\gets Q(x_k, a_k) + \\alpha \\cdot [r_k + \\gamma \\cdot \\underbrace{\\max_a Q(x_{k+1}, a)}_{J(x_{k+1})} - Q(x_k, a_k)]$$ Pseudocode for Q-Learning. Please note that I replaced \"for each episode\" by \"while Q is not converged\" Da die Aktualisierung von $Q$ unabhängig von $\\pi$ erfolgt, ist $Q$-learning ein off-policy Verfahren. ($Q$-Learning hat sich im Gegensatz zu SARSA durchgesetzt) Wenn die Strategie eine GLIE-Strategie ist, kann man mit $Q$-Learning die Konvergenz beweisen.

YouTube: PacMan Mario Q-learning on YouTube. 2010. $Q$-Learning by Tim Eden, Anthony Knittel, Raphael van Uffelen of the University of New South Wales Fazit TD-Learning Vorteile: Beide Verfahren konvergieren sofern GLIE Einfach zu implementiernen, lernen pro Zeitschritt Nachteile: Bootstrapping problemantisch wenn Markov-Annahme nicht erfüllt. Monte-Carlo RL vs. TD RL Sowohl Monte-Carlo Methoden als auch TD-Methoden benötigen Erfahrung um die State-Value Function $V$ zu schätzen. Die Monte-Carlo Methoden gehen wie folgt vor: $$V(s_t) = V(s_t) + \\alpha (R_t - V(s_t))$$ wobei $R_t$ der reward am Ende der Episode ist. Die Temporal Difference (TD) Verfahren gehen wie folgt vor: $$V(s_t) = V(s_t) + \\underbrace{\\alpha [r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\cdot V (s_{t+1}) - V (s_t)]}_{\\text{Temporal Difference}}$$ Die Monte-Carlo-Methoden aktualisieren $V$ also erst am Ende einer Episode, wohingegen Temporal Difference Learning direkt aktualisiert. Mehrschritt-TD-Verfahren $$ \\begin{align} R_k&#94;{(n)} &= r_k + \\gamma \\cdot r_{k+1} + \\dots + \\gamma&#94;{n-1} + \\gamma&#94;n J_\\pi (x_{k+1})\\\\ R_k&#94;{(1)} &\\hat{=} TD\\\\ R_k&#94;{(n)} &\\hat{=} RL \\end{align} $$ Strategiebewertung $$J_\\pi(x_k) \\gets J_\\pi (x_k) + \\alpha \\cdot [R_k&#94;{(n)} - J_\\pi(x_k)]$$ Vorteile: Schnellere Konvergenz als Einschritt-TD Flexible Verbindung von MC und TD Nachteil: Unpraktisch für große $n$. Eligibility Trace ( Verantwortlichkeitsspur ) Problem: Nur der letzte Zustand wird bei klassischen Verfahren belohnt Der Reward wird propagiert, aber nur langsam (nach mehreren Schritten). Idee : Gewichtete Mittelung verschiedener $n$-Schritt-Belohnungen. $$R_k&#94;\\lambda = (1-\\lambda) \\cdot \\sum_{n=1}&#94;\\infty \\lambda&#94;{n-1} R_k&#94;{(n)} \\text{ mit } \\lambda \\in [0,1] \\text{ und } (1-\\lambda)\\sum_{n=1}&#94;\\infty \\lambda&#94;{n-1} = 1$$ beim erreichen eines terminalen Zustands ist $R_k&#94;{(n)} = R_k$ für $n > N-K-1$. Abgewichten von $R_k&#94;{(n)}$ bei steigendem $n$. Spezialfälle : $\\lambda = 0$: $R_k&#94;\\lambda = R_k&#94;{(1)}$ ist ein Ein-Schritt-TD $\\lambda = 1$: $R_k&#94;\\lambda = (1-\\lambda) \\cdot \\sum_{n=1}&#94;{N-k-1} \\lambda&#94;{n-1} R_k&#94;{(n)} + \\lambda&#94;{N-k-1} R_k = R_k$ ist ein Monte Carlo Verfahren Unpraktisch für große $n$, weil man lange auf Aktualisierungen warten muss. Deshalb wird eine Verantwortlichkeitsvariable eingeführt: $$e: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}&#94;+$$ $$e_k(x) = \\begin{cases}\\gamma \\cdot \\lambda e_{k-1}(x) &\\text{falls } x \\neq x_k\\\\ \\gamma \\cdot \\lambda e_{k-1}(x) + 1 &\\text{sonst}\\end{cases}$$ mit $e_0 = 0$. Im zweiten Fall merken wir uns, dass wir den Zustand besucht haben, indem die Variable erhöht wird. Im ersten Fall ist es immer eine Reduktion. Wir speichern welche Zustände kürzlich besucht wurden. Strategiebewertung $TD(\\lambda)$ Wird Zustand $x_k$ besucht, dann ist dessen TD-Fehler $\\delta(x_k) := r_k + \\gamma \\cdot J_\\pi (x_{k+1}) - J_\\pi(x_k)$ Damit wird jeder Zustand $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ korrigiert $$J_\\pi(x) \\leftarrow J_\\pi(x) + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta(x_k) \\cdot e_k(x)$$ wobei $\\alpha$ die Lernrate ist und $e_k$ die Verantwortlichkeit anzeigt. Korrektur erfolgt in Abhängigkeit der Verantwortlichkeit jedes Zustands $x$ am TD-Fehler Beispiel : $e(x) = 0$ für beliebiges $x$. Wird $x$ nicht besucht, so gibt es keine Korrektur. TD(0), dh. $\\lambda = 0$ ist eine \"normales\" Ein-Schritt-TD TD(1), dh. $\\lambda = 1$ ist ein Monte Carlo Verfahren mit Abgewichtung durch $\\gamma$. ISt $\\gamma=1$, dann ist es ein \"normales\" MC mit dem Unterschied, dass man nicht das Ende einer Episode abwarten muss. Policy iteration on-policy: SARSA($\\lambda$) off-policy: Q($\\lambda$) Wichtig : $Q$-Learning wählt gelegentlich nicht-gierige Aktion, korrigiert $Q$ aber mit gieriger Aktion! Um das angemessen zu berücksichtigen wird die Verantwortlichkeitsspur zurückgesetzt. Das passiert insbesondere zu Beginn des Lernens häufiger, da dort eine Exploration zugelassen wird. Fazit Verantwortlichkeitsspuren + typischerweise schnellere Konvergenz im Vergleich zu Ein-Schritt-TD + Einfache Realisierung eines Mehrschritt-TD + Trade-off zwischen TD und MC durch die Wahl von $\\lambda$ - Konvergenz kann im Allgemeinen nicht nachgewiesen werden (abhängig von $\\lambda$ und $N$) - Höherer Rechenaufwand und höherer Speicheraufwand im Vergleich zu Ein-Schritt-TD See also: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton. SARSA($\\lambda$) Pseudocode for SARSA($\\lambda$) $Q(\\lambda)$ Pseudocode for Q($\\lambda$) Funktionsapproximatoren im RL Bisher: Diskrete Zustände und diskrete Aktionen Nun: Kontinuierliche Zustände und Aktionen Bei kontinuierlichen Zuständen/Aktionen ist eine Iteration über alle Zustände/Aktionen nicht mehr möglich. Dennoch sollen Erfahrungen aus besuchten Zuständen auf nicht-besuchte generalisiert werden. Herausforderungen beim RL: Keine statische Trainingsmenge; Daten werden online generiert Nichtstationarität: Die Zielfunktion (z.B. $Q$-Funktion oder direkt die Strategie $\\pi$) verändern sich über die Zeit. Dies schränkt die Menge der Funktionsapproximatoren ein. Ungeeignet: Neuronale Netze, da sie statische Trainingsdaten vorraussetzen Geeignet: Lineare Approximatoren $$f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;l \\Theta_i \\cdot K_i(x)$$ wobei $\\Theta_i$ ein Parameter ist und $K_i$ eine (ggf. nicht-lineare) Kernfunktion (Basisfunktion) ist. Gradienten-Verfahren: Wir verwenden einen parametrischen Approximator mit Parametervektor $\\Theta$. Beispiel: Strategiebewertung Ziel: Approximation der unbekannten Wertefunktion $J_\\pi(x)$ durch $\\tilde{J}(x, \\Theta)$ durch minimierung der quadratischen Abweichung $$J_{\\mathcal{X}} (J_\\pi(x) - \\tilde{J}(x, Q))&#94;2 \\mathrm{d} x \\tag{*}$$ Minimierung von $(*)$ anhand besuchter Zustände $x_k$ mit Gradientenabstieg: $$ \\begin{align} \\Theta_{k+1} &= \\Theta_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\nabla_{\\Theta_k} (J_\\pi(x_k) - \\bar{J}(x_k, Q_k)&#94;2)\\\\ &= \\Theta_k + \\alpha(J_\\pi(x_k) - \\bar{J}(x_k, \\Theta_k)) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\Theta_k} \\tilde{J}(x_k, \\Theta_k) \\end{align} $$ wobei $\\alpha$ die Schrittweite ist. Problem : $J_\\pi(x_k)$ ist unbekannt. Allerdings kann es durch eine Schätzung $$J_\\pi(x_k) \\approx r_k + \\gamma \\cdot \\tilde{J}(x_{k+1}, \\Theta_k)$$ $$\\Theta_{k+1} = \\Theta_k + \\alpha \\cdot [\\underbrace{r_k + \\gamma \\cdot \\tilde{J}(x_{k+1}, \\Theta_k) - \\tilde{J}(x_k, \\Theta_k)}_{\\text{zeitliche Differenz}}] \\cdot \\nabla_{\\Theta_k} \\tilde{J}$$ Beispiele : Strategieverbesserung $$Q_{k+1} = Q_k + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_k \\cdot \\nabla_{\\Theta_k} Q(x_k, a_k, \\Theta_k)$$ mit SARSA: $$\\delta_k = r_k + \\gamma \\cdot Q(x_{k+1}, a_{k+1}, \\Theta_k) - Q(x_k, a_k, \\Theta_k)$$ $Q$-Learning: $$\\delta_k = r_k + \\gamma \\cdot \\max_a Q(x_{k+1}, a, \\Theta_k) - Q(x_k, a_k, \\Theta_k)$$ Anwendung: Backgammon, Go Fazit Funktionsapproximatoren + Es gibt eine direkte Erweiterung von TD auf den kontinuierlichen Fall. - Keine allgemeinen Konvergenzaussagen Modellbasiertes RL Bisher: RL lernt Wertefunktion und Strategie mittels Belohnung aus direkter Interaktion mit Umwelt. Idee: Lerne eine Modell $x_{k+1} \\sim P(\\cdot | x_k)$. Man hat zwei Phasen: Lernen und Planen. In der Lernphase wird das Modell gelernt, in der Planphase wird mit dem Modell der nächste Zustand geplant. Erweiterungen Nutze beobachtete Nachfolgezustände (Übergang) mit Tripel $(x_k, x_{k+1}, a)$ Nutze Simulation der Umwelt Modell Beschreibung der Umwelt Verohersage Reaktion der Umwelt auf Aktion Verbesserung einer Strategie ohne reale Interaktion mit der Umwelt $\\rightarrow$ Schnellere Konvergenz Beispiele DP: vollständiges Modell (Übergangswahrscheinlichkeiten) - völlige Entkopplung Biologisches Lernen: Stichprobenmodell (beispielhafte Übergänge). Dies versucht beispielsweise Dyna-Q $Q$-Learning: Strategielernen aus direkter Erfahrung Planung: Strategieverbesserung aus simulierter Erfahrung Modelllernen: aus direkter Erfahrung Suche: Auswahl von Zuständen und Aktionen für Simulation Dyna-Q Pseudocode for the Dyna-Q algorithm + Besseres Ausnutzen von Erfahrung + Empirisch: schnellere Konvergenz als $Q$-Learning - Annahme eines deterministischen Modells See also: Integrating Planning, Acting, and Learning by Sutton. Adaptive DP Eine Schwachstelle von Dyna-Q ist, dass es ein Stichprobenmodell lernt. Adaptive DP Verbesserung: Lernt frequentistisch Zustandsverteilung von Nachfolgezustand. $P(x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k)$: relative Häufigkeit von $x_{k+1}$ gegeben $x_k$, $a_k$ (frequentistische Sichtweise) kann geschätzt werden: $$P(x_{k+1} | x_k, a_k) \\approx \\frac{m(x_k, a_k, x_{k+1})}{m(x_k, a_k)}$$ wobei $m(x_k, a_k)$ die Anzahl der Besuche von Zustand $x_k$ mit Ausführung ovn Aktion $a_k$ zählt. $m(x_k, a_k, x_{k+1})$ zählt die Übergänge von $x_k$ unter $a_k$ nach $x_{k+1}$. Ergibt sich aus Interaktion mit realer Umwelt. + verbesserte Konvergenz im vgl. zu $Q$-Learning + Reduktion des Modell-Bias - Berechnung von $J&#94;*$ ist aufwendig, muss aber nicht in jedem Schritt / Schleifeniteration ausgeführt werden Gaussian Processes ( Gaussche Prozesse ) Siehe Function Approximation und Gaussche Prozesse . PILCO ( Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control ) PILCO wurde entwickelt für kontinuierliche Zustände und Aktionen. Das Modell: Es wird eine probabilistische Regression auf beobachteten Zustand mittels sog. Gaussian Processes (GP) eingesetzt. Strategieverbesserung: Verwendung parametrischer Strategie Adaptierung der Parameter mittels Policy Search MDP vs POMDP vs RL MDP POMDP RL Agent-Environment Diagram 1 Zustandsraum $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}&#94;n$ 2 Diskrete Zeitschritte $k=0, \\dots, N$ ($N = \\infty$ ist unüblich) Zeithorizont: $N = \\infty$ für fortlaufende Probleme ist üblich, $N < \\infty$ für episodische Probleme 3 Initialzustand $x_0 \\in \\mathcal{X}$ zum Zeitpunkt $k=0$.

Maximimierung der Belohnung $J(x_k) = \\mathbb{E} (R_k | x_k)$. Im fortlaufenden Fall $$R_k = \\sum_{t=0}&#94;\\infty \\gamma&#94;t r_{k+t}$$ mit Diskontierungsfaktor $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$, im episodischen Fall $$R_k = \\sum_{i=k}&#94;{N} r_i,$$ wobei $N$ unbekannt ist.

No Yes Are the states completely observable Yes MC MDP No HMM POMDP Prüfungsfragen Strategiesuche ist NICHT relevant für meine Prüfung am 4. August 2016. Welche 3 Themengebiete wurden in der Vorlesung behandelt und was sind die Unterschiede? → MDP , POMDP , RL Welche Paradoxa haben wir in den Vorlesungen kennen gelernt? → Allais-Paradoxon Nutzen- und Entscheidungs­theorie Warum gibt es die Nutzenfunktion? Warum reicht die Präferenzrelation nicht aus? → Die Nutzenfunktion ist einfacher zu erstellen. Wie lautet der Satz vom Allais-Paradoxon? → Siehe oben . Wie kann man die Nutzentheorie kritisieren? → Siehe oben . Was haben wir zur Entscheidungstheorie gemacht? → Allais-Paradoxon und Rationale Entscheidungen Wie ist eine Nutzenfunktion definiert? → Siehe oben . Optimierungs­theorie Wie löst man Optimierungsprobleme ohne Nebenbedingungen? → Iterativer Abstieg (z.B. Gradientenverfahren), Dynamische Programmierung, Label-Korrektur-Algorithmus; LQR wenn linear Wann existiert kein globales Minimum für ein Optimierungsproblem? → Wenn die Menge der zulässigen Lösungen nach unten unbeschränkt ist, d.h. \\(\\text{arg} \\min_x f(x) = - \\infty\\) oder wenn die untere Schranke nicht angenommen wird, wie es beispielsweise für \\(e&#94;x\\) der Fall ist. Wie löst man Optimierungsprobleme mit Nebenbedingungen? → Lagrange-Ansatz wenn nur Gleichungsnebenbedingungen vorliegen und der KKT -Ansatz für Gleichungs- und Ungleichungsnebenbedingungen. Numerisch gibt es noch Penalty-Ansätze . Wann ist es leichter / schwerer das Optimierungsproblem zu lösen? → Keine Nebenbedingungen, in \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) oder kleiner diskreter Raum, wenn die zu optimierende Funktion linear oder konkav ist. Beweisen Sie, dass der Gradient senkrecht auf die Höhenlinien steht. → Siehe math.StackExchange . Welche numerischen Methoden zur Optimierung kennen sie? → Iterativer Abstieg (Gradientenverfahren, Newton-Verfahren), Penalty-Ansätze Was bedeutet es, dass ein Problem geschlossen lösbar ist? → Das ist nicht eindeutig definiert. Streng könnte man folgendes sagen: Wenn auf die Verwendung von numerischen Verfahren (z.B. Gradientenabstieg, Monte-Carlo-Verfahren, etc.) verzichtet werden und die Lösung in Form von mathematischen Grundfunktionen angegeben werden kann. Aber das wird häufig auch etwas lockerer gesehen, etwa wenn man zwar numerische Verfahren benötigt, man aber weiß dass diese sicher zur global optimal Lösung konvergieren (wie etwas bei konvexen Problemen). Auch die mathematischen Grundfunktionen sind vage. So wird gerne die erf-Funktion als eine Grundfunktionen angesehen, obwohl man diese nur approximativ (etwas tabellarisch und per Interpolation) berechnen kann. Welche geschlossen lösbaren Spezialfälle existieren? → Lineare Planungsprobleme (Foliensatz 7, Folie 17/21), auch bei POMDPs (vgl. Foliensatz 8 und Folie 6) Welche Probleme sind nicht geschlossen lösbar? → POMDPs (bis auf Ausnahmen, vgl. Foliensatz 8 und Folie 6), Bayesscher Schätzer (Foliensatz 8, Folie 15) Welche Möglichkeiten der approximativen Lösung existieren bzw. sind anwendbar? → Änderung der Optimierung (OL, OLF, MP ), Abbildung auf geschlossen lösbare Probleme (Linearisierung, Diskretisierung, Sicherheitsäquivalenz), Verwendung von Funktionsapproximatoren (parametrisch oder nicht-parametrisch) Was versteht man unter Pontryagin's Minimum-Prinzip und wozu ist es gut? → Pontryagins Minimum-Prinzip liefert für deterministische Planungsprobleme ein notwendiges Kriterium für globale Minima. Was versteht man unter dem Optimalitätsprinzip? → Das Optimalitätsprinzip von Bellman besagt, das bei einigen Optimierungsproblemen sich die optimale Lösung aus optimalen Lösungen für die Teilprobleme zusammensetzt. Ein Beispiel ist die Kürzeste-Wege-Suche. Wenn A-B-C-D der kürzeste Weg von A nach D ist, so ist auch A-B-C der kürzeste Weg von A nach C. MDP Wie lautet die Definition eines MDP? → Siehe oben . Wie viele Pläne gibt es? → Für diskrete \\(\\mathcal{X}, A\\) und \\(N\\) Zeitschritte gibt es \\(|A|&#94;N\\) mögliche Pläne. In jedem Zeitschritt gibt es eine mögliche Aktion. Wie viele Strategien gibt es? → Für diskrete \\(\\mathcal{X}, A\\) und \\(N\\) Zeitschritte gibt es \\(|A|&#94;{N \\cdot |\\mathcal{X}|}\\) Strategien, da für jede Kombination aus Zeitschritt und Zustand eine Aktion gewählt werden muss. Was versteht man unter dynamischer Programmierenung? → Siehe oben . Wie lauten die Bellman-Gleichungen? → Siehe oben . Was ist an den Bellman-Gleichungen problematisch? → i) Erwartungswertberechnung (kann aufwendig sein), ii) Lösen des Minimierungsproblems und iii) Repräsentation der Wertfunktion insbes. bei kontinuierlichem Zustand Wie hängt ein deterministisches MDP mit der kürzesten Wegesuche zusammen? → Die optimale Lösung eines deterministisches MDPs ist der kürzeste Weg in dem Graphen, der durch die Zustände des MDPs sowie den Kosten zwischen den Zuständen als Gewicht dargestellt werden. Was macht der LQR? → Ein LQR regelt ein lineares System mit quadratischen Kosten auf einen Zielwert (vgl. oben ). Wieso sind MDPs schwer zu lösen? → Es gibt \\(|\\mathcal{A}|&#94;N\\) mögliche Pläne und \\(|A|&#94;{N \\cdot |\\mathcal{X}|}\\) mögliche Strategien. (vgl. On the Complexity of Solving Markov Decision Problems ) Wo ist der Fixpunktsatz von Bedeutung? → Bei dem Beweis, dass die Werte-Iteration gegen die optimale Lösung konvergiert (siehe T-Kontraktion ). POMDP Wie lautet die Definition eines POMDP? → Siehe oben Wie lautet die Kostenfunktion eines POMDP? → Siehe oben Was ist der Unterschied des LQR beim MDP und POMDP? → Bei POMDPs ist die optimale Strategie \\(\\pi_k&#94;* (\\mathcal{I}_k) = L_k \\cdot \\mathbb{E} (x_k | \\mathcal{I}_k)\\) , wohingegen beim MDP die optimale Strategie \\(\\pi_k&#94;*(x_k) = L_k \\cdot x_k\\) ist. (Beim POMDP wird die Sicherheitsäquivalenz genutzt). Was ist PWLC? → Piece-wise linear and Concave / Convex Warum sind PWLCs in dieser Vorlesung von Bedeutung? → In dem Spezialfall endlicher Planungsprobleme in POMDPs kann das POMDP in ein Belief-State MPD transformiert werden. Dann ist die Wertefunktion \\(J_k\\) eine PWLC; mit \\(\\alpha\\) -Vektoren kann die optimale Strategie berechnet werden. Was versteht man unter Modellprädiktiver Planung (MP)? → Modellprädiktive Planung ist OLF, über einen kurzen, aber wandernden Horizont. Im Gegensatz zu OLF kann Modellprädiktive Planung auch bei nicht-episodischen Problemen verwendet werden, da in der OLF der Plan \\(a_{k:N-1}&#94;*\\) durch Minimierung von \\(\\mathbb{E}[g_N(x_N) + \\sum_{i=k}&#94;{N-1} g_i(x_i, a_i) | \\mathcal{I}_k]\\) berechnet wird. Bei der modellprädiktiven Planung hingegen wird nur \\(a_{k:(k+M)}\\) durch Minimierung von \\(\\mathbb{E}[g_N(x_N) + \\sum_{i=k}&#94;{k+M-1} g_i(x_i, a_i) | \\mathcal{I}_k]\\) berechnet. Was versteht man unter der Sicherheitsäquivalenz? → Siehe oben . Was können Sie zur Sensoreinsatzplanung sagen? → Siehe oben . Wie kann man die Kosten bei der Sensoreinsatzplanung modellieren? → Kovarianzbasiert oder Informationstheoretisch (Entropie, Transinformation) Warum reicht Kovarianzbasiert bei linearen Sensoreinsatzproblem? → Informationstheoretische Kosten wie z.B. die Entropie lassen sich bei linearen Probelmen auf Kovarianzbasierte Kosten reduzieren. Wie berechnet man die \\(\\alpha\\) -Vektoren und wozu dienen Sie? → Siehe ProPlan-10-Folien.pdf, Folie 16. Die \\(\\alpha\\) -Vektoren sind im Kontext von diskreten Planungsproblemen zu verstehen. An Ihnen kann man die Aktion ablesen. RL Welche Arten von RL gibt es? → Wertefunktionsbasiert (Schätzen der Werte- bzw. \\(Q\\) -Funktion aus Stichproben: Monte Carlo, Temporal Difference, Verantwortlichkeitsspuren, Funktionsapproximatoren), Modelllernende Methoden, Strategiesuche Was ist der Vorteil von Modelllernenden Verfahren? → Die Umwelt kann anhand des Modells simuliert werden und muss nicht real beobachtet werden. Das erleichtert das Planen / finden der Strategie. Was ist der große Vorteil von Off-policy RL? → TODO (See What are the advantages / disadvantages of off-policy RL vs on-policy RL? ) Warum ist Q-Learning Off-policy? → Q-Learning verwendet eine gierige Aktion um die Q-Funktion zu aktualisieren, obwohl der Agent zur Auswahl von Aktionen zwecks Zustandsfortschriebung nicht einer gierigen Stragegie folgt, sondern etwa einer \\epsilon-gierigen Strategie. SARSA dagegen nutzt dieselbe (nicht-gierige) Strategie zum Aktualisieren der Q-Funktion und zur Aktionswahl. Daher ist SARSA on-policy und Q-Learning off-policy. Notation Der Dozent nutzt folgende Notation: \\(J&#94;*, \\pi&#94;*\\) : Das Asterisk * deutet an, dass die Kosten / Strategie optimal sind. \\(\\underline{x}\\) : Der Unterstrich deutet an, dass es sich um einen Vektor handelt. Diese Notation wurde in diesem Artikel nicht übernommen. \\(\\hat{x}\\) : Der Hut zeigt an, dass der Zustand \\(x\\) geschätzt ist. Was üblicherweise die Value function \\(V\\) ist, ist in dieser Vorlesung \\(J\\) . \\(g_N&#94;x\\) ist die Ableitung der Funktion \\(g_N\\) nach \\(x\\) .

Optimization Basics Mein Prüfungsprotokoll Fazit Die Vorlesung führt in das Reinforcment Learning ein. Um das Problem und die möglichen Algorithmen zu verstehen werden MDPs und POMDPs eingeführt. Die Vorlesung ist sehr gut strukturiert. Alle Grundlagen werden eingeführt, sodass sehr wenig Vorwissen nötig ist. Dennoch sind absolute Grundlagen der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und der Optimierungstheorie / Analysis empfehlenswert; sonst geht es zu schnell. Aktuell sieht man als Student immer wieder mal zusammenhänge nicht. Es ist in dieser Vorlesung essentiell am Ball zu bleiben, sonst wird man schnell abgehängt. Ich empfehle die Tabelle anzuschauen; daran kann man einige Zusammenhänge gut erkennen. Der Dozent ist sehr freundlich und scheinbar immer gut gelaunt, beantwortet Fragen kompetent und sorgt allgemein für eine sehr angenehme Atmosphäre sowohl in der Vorlesung als auch in der Prüfung. Das Tempo der Vorlesung ist eigentlich sehr gut, aber es gibt immer wieder Stellen wo man schnell abgehängt wird. Daher wäre es wünschenswert, auf den längeren Stücken vielleicht an der Tafel den aktuellen Kontext zu geben (z.B.: POMDP, linearer Spezialfall). Insgesamt kann ich sagen, dass es eine meiner Lieblingsvorlesungen war. Es war aber auch eine der Vorlesungen, wo ich mir am meisten Sorgen über die Prüfung gemacht habe und enorm viel Zeit reingesteckt habe. Es hat sich - sowohl von der Note, als auch vom Wissensgewinn - gelohnt.

However, it takes much less computing power to evaluate the model for a single instance. One important factor when measuring the time of a program which only runs one image classification is the time for loading the model itself. Only the reading / structuring of the computational graph. We don't want to load the model often. One possible way around this is making a web service. The user connects to it, uploads an image and gets the result. But the model is loaded all the time and the web service is running all the time. One problem with this approach is that you might want to work on the web interface and not having to reload the machine learning part all the time. I also think this might be one of the most inefficient ways to realize IPC . Today, it came to my mind that there might be a cleaner approach. I thought about creating a daemon and using RPCs. Credits to codeape . He provided the basis for the examples below. RPC basics RPC is short for remote procedure call . It is a call to a function which is not in the same address space as the calling function. So basically code in program A calls code from program B. In Python, this is actually pretty easy to use with Pyro . Server Create a file summon_daemon.py : #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\"The server.\"\"\" import Pyro.core class Bartimaeus ( Pyro . core . ObjBase ): \"\"\"The called class.\"\"\" def __init__ ( self ): \"\"\"Constructor.\"\"\" Pyro . core . ObjBase . __init__ ( self ) self . counter = 0 def count ( self , up ): \"\"\"Count up.\"\"\" self . counter += up return \"I was called {count} times.\" . format ( count = self . counter ) Pyro . core . initServer () daemon = Pyro . core . Daemon () uri = daemon . connect ( Bartimaeus (), \"bartid\" ) print ( \"The daemon runs on port: {port}\" . format ( port = daemon . port )) print ( \"The object's uri is: {uri}\" . format ( uri = uri )) daemon . requestLoop () Client And a call_daemon.py : #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\"Talk with the daemon.\"\"\" import Pyro.core # you have to change the URI below to match your own host/port. bartimaeus = Pyro . core . getProxyForURI ( \"PYROLOC://localhost:7766/bartid\" ) print ( bartimaeus . count ( 1 )) Timing I was interested how fast this is locally. So I made a tiny test: Server ( summon_daemon.py ): #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- \"\"\"The server.\"\"\" import logging import sys import Pyro.core logging . basicConfig ( format = ' %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s ' , level = logging . DEBUG , stream = sys . stdout ) class Bartimaeus ( Pyro . core . ObjBase ): \"\"\"The called class.\"\"\" def __init__ ( self ): \"\"\"Constructor.\"\"\" Pyro . core . ObjBase . __init__ ( self ) self . counter = 0 def count ( self , up ): \"\"\"Count up.\"\"\" logging . info ( \"new up: %i \" , up ) self . counter += up return \"I was called {count} times.\" . format ( count = self . counter ) Pyro . core . initServer () daemon = Pyro . core . Daemon () uri = daemon . connect ( Bartimaeus (), \"bartid\" ) print ( \"The daemon runs on port: {port}\" . format ( port = daemon . port )) print ( \"The object's uri is: {uri}\" . format ( uri = uri )) daemon . requestLoop () Client ( call_daemon.py ): #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- \"\"\"Talk with the daemon.\"\"\" import logging import sys import Pyro.core logging . basicConfig ( format = ' %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s ' , level = logging . DEBUG , stream = sys . stdout ) def main ( up ): \"\"\"Do something with bartimaeus - who lives in another realm.\"\"\" # you have to change the URI below to match your own host/port. logging . info ( \"Send up: %i \" , up ) bartimaeus = Pyro . core . getProxyForURI ( \"PYROLOC://localhost:7766/bartid\" ) print ( bartimaeus . count ( up )) def get_parser (): \"\"\"Get parser object for call_demon.py.\"\"\" from argparse import ArgumentParser , ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter parser = ArgumentParser ( description = __doc__ , formatter_class = ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter ) parser . add_argument ( \"-n\" , dest = \"up\" , default = 1 , type = int , help = \"count up\" ) return parser if __name__ == \"__main__\" : args = get_parser () . parse_args () main ( args . up ) resulting in about 0.004s from sending to receiving. About 0.004s from sending to receiving A small chat You could implement a very simple chat with this. I only have version 3.16 of Pyro which seems not to have callbacks so that the server can inform the client when a new message is there. This means the following toy implementation expects the user to send messages to receive the current ones. Not nice, but I just wanted to give it a try: Server: #!/usr/bin/env python \"\"\"A chat server.\"\"\" import Pyro.core class Chat ( Pyro . core . ObjBase ): \"\"\"The called class.\"\"\" def __init__ ( self ): \"\"\"Constructor.\"\"\" Pyro . core . ObjBase . __init__ ( self ) self . msgs = [] self . clients = [] def receive ( self , sender , msg , last_msg ): \"\"\"Receive a message.\"\"\" self . msgs . append (( sender , msg )) print ( \"[{sender}] {msg}\" . format ( sender = sender , msg = msg )) return ( self . msgs [ last_msg :], len ( self . msgs )) Pyro . core . initServer () daemon = Pyro . core . Daemon () uri = daemon . connect ( Chat (), \"chat\" ) print ( \"The daemon runs on port: {port}\" . format ( port = daemon . port )) print ( \"The object's uri is: {uri}\" . format ( uri = uri )) daemon . requestLoop () Client: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- \"\"\"A chat client.\"\"\" import logging import sys import Pyro.core logging . basicConfig ( format = ' %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s ' , level = logging . DEBUG , stream = sys . stdout ) def main ( server , name ): \"\"\"Run the chat.\"\"\" chat_server = Pyro . core . getProxyForURI ( server ) last_msg_id = 0 print ( \"*\" * 80 ) print ( \"* Chat started. You are called '{name}'.\" . format ( name = name )) print ( \"*\" * 80 ) while True : msg = raw_input () new_msgs , last_msg_id = chat_server . receive ( name , msg , last_msg_id ) for sender , msg in new_msgs : print ( \"[{sender}] {msg}\" . format ( sender = sender , msg = msg )) def get_parser (): \"\"\"Get parser object for chat_client.py.\"\"\" from argparse import ArgumentParser , ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter parser = ArgumentParser ( description = __doc__ , formatter_class = ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter ) parser . add_argument ( \"--server\" , dest = \"server\" , required = True , help = \"starts with PYRO://\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"--name\" , required = True , help = \"what others see\" ) return parser if __name__ == \"__main__\" : args = get_parser () . parse_args () main ( args . server , args . name ) Daemons A daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

Jedes Attribut wird für sich betrachtet. Es wird anhand von dem Attribut gesplittet, bei dem die Fehlerquote am geringsten ist. Clustering Suchen von Punkten, die nahe bei einander liegen. Unterschiede: Attribute: Abstandsmaße Form Dichte Größe Zeitlicher Aspekt: Alte Daten weniger wichtig Alternate Clustering Association Rules Association Rules sind Regeln der Form: Wenn eine Transaktion A enthält, dann auch B (formal: $A \\Rightarrow B$). Association rules werden z.B. in der Market Basket Analysis eingesetzt. Sie können aus Frequent item sets relativ einfach erzeugt werden. Der Apriori Algorithmus dient dem Finden von Association Rules. Association Rules sind stark mit Collaborative filtering verwandt. Predictive Maintenance Ziel: Für Motoren will man vorhersagen, wann diese einen Fehler aufweisen und damit gewartet werden müssen. Dabei gibt es zwei Fehlerarten, die unterschiedliche hohe Kosten aufweisen: Ausfall wird vorhergesagt, tritt aber nicht ein: Unnötige Wartung Ausfall wird nicht vorhergesagt, tritt aber ein: Teurer Ausfall Change detection Erkennung wesentlicher Veränderungen in einer Zeitreihe. Statistische Grundlagen Slides: 2-statistGrundlagen.pdf Skalen von Merkmalen Siehe Mustererkennung Kennzahlen für Daten Median / Mean Min / Max Quantile Varianz / Streuung Outlier Metrische Daten Ein Metrischer Raum ist eine Menge $M$ mit einer Funktion $d: M \\times M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_0&#94;+$ für die gilt: Symmetrie: $\\forall p,q \\in M: d(p, q) = d(q, p) $ Definitheit: $\\forall p,q \\in M: d(p, q) = 0 \\Leftrightarrow p = q$ Dreiecksungleichung: $\\forall p,q,r \\in M: d(p, r) \\leq d(p,q) + d(q, r)$ Aggregatfunktion Eine Funktion, welche als Eingabe eine Menge von Werten erwartet und einen Wert ausgibt (z.B. SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, MEAN, häufigster Wert, Truncated Average, mid range). Aggregatfunktionen sind entweder distributiv , algebraisch oder holistisch . Distributive Aggregatfunktion Es gibt eine Funktion $G$, so dass $$F(\\{X_{i,j}\\}) = G(\\{F(X_{i,j} | i=1, \\dots, l) | j = 1, \\dots, J\\})$$ MIN, MAX und COUNT sind distributive Aggregatfunktionen. Algebraische Aggregatfunktion Es gibt eine Funktion $G$, die ein $M$-Tupel liefert und $H$, so dass $$F(\\{X_{i,j}\\}) = H(\\{G(\\{X_{i,j} | i=1, \\dots, l\\}) | j=1, \\dots, J\\})$$ AVG ist eine Algebraische Aggregatfunktion. Hier berechnet $G$ die Summe und gibt zusätzlich die Anzahl der Werte zurück. $H$ summiert die Summen auf und teilt das Ergebnis durch die Gesamtzahl. Weitere: Truncated Average Holistische Aggregatfunktion Man kann keine Beschränkung des Speicherbedarfs für Sub-Aggregate, d.h. Aggregate über $\\{X_{i,j}| i=1, \\dots, l\\}$, angeben. Der häufigste Wert und der Median sind holistische Aggregatfunktionen. Self-Maintainable Aggregatfunktion Wenn man den aktuellen Wert der Aggregatfunktion kennt und man löscht einen Wert bzw. fügt einen Wert ein, dann kann man direkt den neuen Wert der Aggregatfunktion über den angepassten Datenbestand berechnen. Nicht-self-maintainable ist der häufigste Wert. MIN und MAX ist self-maintainable bzgl. Einfügen. Mid-Range $$\\frac{MAX-MIN}{2}$$ Entropie $$E(S) = - \\sum_{j} p_j \\cdot \\log p_j$$ $E(S)=0$ ist minimal, wenn es ein $j$ gibt mit $p_j = 1$. $E(S)=\\log(n)$ ist maximal, wenn $p_i = p_j$ gilt für $i, j$. Korrelationsmaße Sind üblicherweise auf [-1, 1] normiert. Die Kovarianz ist ein nicht-normiertes Korrelationsmaß. Kovarianz $$\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) := \\operatorname E\\bigl[(X - \\operatorname E(X)) \\cdot (Y - \\operatorname E(Y))\\bigr]$$ Korrelationskoeffizient $$\\varrho(X,Y) =\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma(X)\\sigma(Y)} \\in [-1, 1]$$ PCA ( Principal Component Analysis ) PCA ist ein Algorithmus zur Reduktion von Daten durch das Entfernen von Attributen. Er projeziert die Datenobjekte auf eine Hyperebene, sodass ein Maximum der Varianz beibehalten wird (vgl. Neuronale Netze ) Chi-Quadrat-Test Oberbegriff für mehrere Tests; hier nur der Unabhängigkeitstest. Gegeben sind zwei Verteilungen von Zufallsvariablen $X, Y$. Die Frage ist, ob sie unabhängig sind. Dazu zählt man die Ausprägungen $i=1, \\dots, m_1$ des Merkmals $X$ und die Ausprägungen $j=1, \\dots, m_2$ des Merkmals $Y$ sowie wie häufig diese in Kombination auftreten ($n_{ij}$). Man schätzt den erwarteten Wert durch $e_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}&#94;{m_2} n_{ik} \\right) \\cdot \\left (\\sum_{k=1}&#94;{m_2} n_{kj}\\right )$. Der Chi-Quadrat wert ist dann: $$\\chi&#94;2 = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;{m_1} \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{m_2} \\frac{(n_{ij} - e_{ij})&#94;2}{e_{ij}}$$ Daraus wird ein $p$-Wert abgeleitet. Wenn dieser unter einem Schwellwert wie $\\alpha = 0.01$ ist, dann wird die Hypothese, dass die Verteilungen unabhängig sind, zurückgewiesen. Die Nullhypothese, dass $X, Y$ unabhängig sind wird auf dem Signifikanzniveau $\\alpha$ verworfen, falls $$\\chi&#94;2 > \\chi&#94;2_{(1-\\alpha; (m_1-1)(m_2-1))}$$ Kolmogorow-Smirnow-Test ( KSA-Test ) Test auf unabhängigkeit kontinuierlicher Verteilungen, also: $$H_0: F_X(x) = F_0(x)$$ Es wird die empirsche Verteilungsfunktion $S$ gebildet und diese mit der hypothetischen Verteilungsfunktion $F_0$ verglichen, wobei $S(x_0) = 0$ gesetzt wird: $$d_{\\max} = \\max(\\max_{i=1, \\dots, n}|S(x_i) - F_0(x_i)|, \\max_{i=1, \\dots, n} |S(x_{i-1} - F_0(x_i))|)$$ $H_0$ wird verworfen, wenn $d_{\\max} > d_\\alpha$, wobei $d_\\alpha$ bis zu $n=35$ tabelliert vorliegt. Bei großerem $n$ kann näherungsweise $$d_\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(\\frac{\\alpha}{2})}{n}}$$ Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test ($U$-Test) Es seien $X,Y$ Zufallsvariablen mit Verteilungsfunktionen $F_X(x) = F_Y(x-a)$ für ein $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. $H_0: a = 0$ vs $H_1: a \\neq 0$ Vorgehen: Gemeinsame Stichprobe sortieren, Rangsumme für $X$ und $Y$ bilden, Betrag der Differenz mit Tabelleneintrag vergleichen. Datenreduktion Numerosity Reduction: Reduziere die Anzahl der betrachteten Datenobjekte Parametrische Verfahren: Nehme eine bekannte Wahrscheinlichkeits­verteilung der Datenobjekte an und schätze deren Paramter. Arbeite dann nur mit der Verteilung Nichtparametrische Verfahren: Sampling, Clustering, Histogramme Dimensionality Reduction: Reduziere die Anzahl der Attribute. Forward Feature Construction: Starte nur mit einem Feature und gebe dem Classifier so lange neue Features, bis die gewünschte Genauigkeit erreicht wurde. Feature Elimination: Starte mit allen Features und entferne so lange Features, wie die gewünschte Genauigkeit erhalten bleibt. PCA Diskretisierung: Reduziere die Werte pro Attribut.

Die Balancierung wird durch eine Kombination aus heterogenem k-d-Baum und B*-Baum erreicht. Der baum ist also nicht auf logischer, sondern nur auf physischer Ebene balanciert. R-Baum Ein R-Baum ist ein balancierter Baum, welcher die Datenobjekte in minimale AABBs einschließt. Jeder Knoten hat eine solche AABB und jedes der Kinder - egal ob es wieder ein AABB oder Datenpunkte sind - ist darin. Diese AABBs können sich überschneiden. Siehe auch: What is the difference between a R-tree and a BVH? Nearest Neighbor in R-Tree Siehe Pseudo-Code . Entscheidungs­bäume Slides: 4-Entscheidungsbaeume.pdf Dieses Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit der Klassifikation mit Entscheidungsbäumen. Qualitätskriterien für Entscheidungsbäume Ergebnisqualität Kompaktheit: Je kompakter der Baum, desto besser kann die Entscheidung vom Benutzer nachempfunden werden. Wahl der Split-Attribute Entropie eines Splits minimieren: $$E(S_1, S_2) = \\frac{n_1}{n} E(S_1) + \\frac{n_2}{n} E(S_2)$$ Overfitting Entscheidungsbaum ist zu sehr an Trainingsdatenbestand angepasst Prepruning ( Forward pruning ) Schon beim Erstellen des Entscheidungsbaumes wird ab einer gewissen Tiefe abgebrochen Postpruning ( Backward pruning ) Der Entscheidungsbaum wird komplett aufgebaut, aber dannach wird greprunt. Evaluation Slides: 5-Evaluation.pdf Resubsitution Error Trainingsfehler $k$-Fold Cross-Validation ( Kreuzvalidierung ) Unterteile den Datensatz in $k$ Teile. Dabei sollten die Klassen in etwa gleich häufig in allen Teilen vorkommen. Mache nun $k$ durchläufe, wobei der $k$-te Datensatz immer zum Testen und alle anderen zum Trainieren verwendet werden. Berechne die $k$ Testfehler. Mittle diese am Ende. Das ist ein besserer Schätzwert für den realen Fehler als eine einmalige Unterteilung in Training- und Testmenge. Stratification Sicherstellen, dass bestimmte Eigenschaften (z.B. Klassenzugehörigkeit) in Partitionen etwa gleich verteilt ist. Loss function Eine Funktion, die angibt, wie viel man durch eine unkorrekte Vorhersage verliert. Informational Loss function $$- \\log_2 p_i$$ - Wahrscheinlichkeiten der nicht-eintretenden Klassen spielen keine Rolle Quadratic Loss function $$\\sum_{j} (p_j - a_j)&#94;2$$ mit tatsächlichem Label $a_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$ und geschätzter Wahrscheinlichkeit $p_j$ für die Klasse $j$. Bias Das Verfahren an sich funktioniert nicht gut. Selbst beliebig viele Trainingsdaten beheben dieses Problem nicht. Der Fehler ist inhärent im Verfahren verankert. Varianz Fehler welcher durch das Fehlen von Trainingsdaten verursacht wird. Gesamt-Erfolgsquote $$\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$ Konfusionsmatrix ( Confusion matrix ) Eine Tabelle, in der jede Zeile für die tatsächlichen Klassen stehen und die Spalten für die vorhergesagten Klassen. Die Diagonalelemente zählen also die richtig vorhergesagten Datenobjekte; alle anderen Zellen zählen falsche Vorhersagen. Kappa-Koeffizient ( Cohens Kappa ) Vergleich mit Klassifier, der nur den Anteil der Klassenzugehörigkeit schätzt: $$\\kappa =\\frac{p_0-p_c}{1-p_c}$$ wobei $p_0$ die gemessene Übereinstimmung ist und $p_c$ die erwartete Übereinstimmung bei Unabhängigkeit. Wenn also $h_{ij}$ die Anzahl der Datenobjekte ist, für die der erste Klassifizierer die Klasse $i$ und der zweite Klassifizierer die Klasse $j$ vorhergesagt hat sowie $N$ die Gesamtzahl der Datenobjekte und $z$ die Gesamtzahl der Klassen, dann gilt: $$p_0 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;z h_{ii}}{N}$$ Die erwartete Übereinstimmung $p_c$ wird über die Randhäufigkeiten geschätzt: $$p_c = \\frac{1}{N&#94;2} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;z h_{.i} \\cdot h_{i.}$$ Der Wertebereich ist also: $\\kappa \\in (-\\infty; 1]$, wobei der minimale Wert von $\\kappa$ nicht beliebig klein werden kann. Lift-Faktor Faktor, um den sich die Rücklaufquote erhöht: $$\\mathrm{lift}(X\\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{ \\mathrm{support}(X \\cup Y)}{ \\mathrm{support}(X) \\cdot \\mathrm{support}(Y) }$$ Der Lift ist ein Indiz für die Unabhängigkeit von $X$ und $Y$. Ist der Lift nahe bei 1, dann spricht das für die Unabhängigkeit. Ein Lift-Faktor kleiner als 1 bedeutet, dass die Itemsets zusammen seltener vorkommen als bei Unabhängigkeit zu erwarten wäre. Ein Lift-Faktor von größer als 1 bedeutet, dass die Itemsets zusammen häufiger vorkommen als bei Unabhängigkeit zu erwarten wäre. ROC ( Receiver Operator Characteristic ) x-Achse: $\\frac{FP}{FP+TN} \\cdot 100$ (FP-Rate), y-Achse: $\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} \\cdot 100$ (TP-Rate) Siehe auch: Namensherkunft Recall ( True Positive Rate , TPR , Sensitivität ) $$TPR = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = 1 - FNR \\in [0, 1]$$ Der Recall gibt den Anteil der erkannten positiven aus allen positiven an. Sensitivität ist ein in der Medizin üblicher Begriff. Precision ( Genauigkeit ) $$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\in [0, 1]$$ Die Precision gibt den Anteil der real positiven aus den als positiv erkannten an. F-Measure ( F1 score ) $$\\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{precision} \\cdot \\text{recall}}{\\text{recall} + \\text{precision}}$$ Correlation Coefficient Der Correlation Coefficient ist kein Fehlermaß. Der $CC(p, a)$ ist groß, wenn sich $p$ und $a$ ähnlich sind. $$CC(p, a) = \\frac{COV(p, a)}{\\sigma(p) \\cdot \\sigma(a)}$$ Mit $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\cdot \\sum_{i} (x_i - \\bar{x})&#94;2$ Code Abbildung, die jedem Element des Alphabets eine Folge aus 0en und 1en zuweist.

Association Rules Slides: 6-Association-Rules-1.pdf und 7-Association-Rules-2.pdf Es zieht sich die Warenkorbanalyse als Beispiel durch. Allerdings sind folgende Anwendungen von Association Rules denkbar: Netflix: Man kennt User und welche Filme diese mögen (5 Sterne). Welche weiteren, unbewerteten Filme könnten diesen gefallen? Amazon: Im Warenkorb sind Produkte XY. Was wird der User wohl noch kaufen? Online-Konfiguratoren: Welche Konfigurationen sollte man \"bündeln\", z.B. bei Autos in eine \"Sport-Variante\"? Last FM: Music Recommendations Medicine: Implementation of Apriori Algorithm in Health Care Sector: A Survey Frequent Itemset Ein Frequent Itemset ist eine Menge von Items, die häufig zusammen gekauft werden. Transaktion ( Itemset ) Menge von Items, die zusammen gekauft wurden. Association rules Drücken aus wie Phänomene zueinander in Beziehung stehen. Beispiel: Wer Bier kauft, der kauft auch Chips. Support Die Anzahl der Transaktionen, die das Itemset $I$ enthalten wird Support von $I$ genannt. Es gilt: $$\\text{support}(A \\Rightarrow B) = \\text{support}(A \\cup B)$$ Closed Itemset Ein Itemset $I$ heißt closed, wenn es keine echte Obermenge $I' \\supsetneq I$ gibt, die den gleichen Support $\\text{support}(I') = \\text{support}(I)$ hat. Confidence Confidence von $A \\Rightarrow B$ ist der Anteil der Transaktionen, die $A$ und $B$ enthalten, von den Transaktione die $A$ enthalten: $$\\text{conf}(A \\Rightarrow B) = \\frac{\\text{support}(A \\cup B)}{\\text{support}(A)} \\in [0, 1]$$ Apriori Algorithmus Der Apriori-Algorithmus ist ein Generate-and-Test-Algorithmus zum Finden von Frequent Itemsets. Erzeuge alle einelementigen Frequent Itemsets for k in range(2, n): Erzeuge die $k$-elementigen frequent Itemsets (join, prune, support counting) Frequent itemsets: Association Rules Der Algorithmus nutzt aus, dass eine notwendige Bedingung für $k$-elementige Frequent Itemsets ist, dass alle $k-1$-elementigen Frequent Itemsets auch Frequent sein müssen. Verbesserungen: Stichproben verwenden (Sampling) Aggressiver durch Datenbestand gehen (z.B. von k=3 zu k=6 springen) Hashfilter Hash-Filter ( Hash-Tabelle ) Unterstützt das Support-Counting für viele Kandidaten. Die Hash-Tabelle wird einmalig für alle Kandidaten der Länge $k$ aufgebaut und stellt eine notwendige, aber keine hinreichnde Bedingung für Frequent Itemsets dar. Hash Tree Wenn man viele Kandidaten für $k$-elementige Frequent Itemsets hat, dann kann das support counting lange dauern. Deshalb baut man sich vor dem Support Counting für alle Kandidaten einen Hash-Tree mit $k$ Ebenen auf. Man sortiert die Items der Kandidaten auf, indem man einen Pfad für jeden Kandidaten im Baum hinzufügt. Jeder Knoten im Hash-Tree enspricht also einem Item. Ein Item $i$ in Ebene $j$ steht dafür, dass der Kandidat an Stelle $j$ das Item $i$ hat. Allerdings kann man auch früher aufhören, wenn es keine Kollisionen gibt. Der Hash-Tree repräsentiert also die Kandidaten, nicht die Transaktionen. FP-Trees FP-Trees (FP für \"frequent pattern\") sind eine Datenstrutkur zum schnellen Finden von Frequent Itemsets. Jeder Knoten im Baum repräsentiert ein Item. Jeder Knoten speichert zusätzlich die Häufigkeit des Präfixes, welcher durch den Pfad von der Wurzel zu dem Knoten dargestellt wird. Zusätzlich speichert jeder Knoten des Items $i$ einen Zeiger auf einen anderen Knoten mit einem Item $i$. Jede Transaktion entspricht einem Pfad im FP-Tree. Zusätzlich zum FP-Tree gibt es eine Header-Tabelle. Die Zeilen dieser Tabelle sind einzelne Items $i$, denen jeweils ein Zeiger auf einen Knoten im FP-Tree zugeordnet sind, der auch das Item $i$ repräsentiert. Für jedes Item gibt es also eine verkettete Liste, die das Vorkommen im Baum angibt. Zum Finden von Frequent Items geht man also wie folgt vor: Für jedes Item: Zähle in wie vielen Transaktionen das Item vorkommt. Sortiere Items in Transaktion absteigend nach Häufigkeit. Bei gleicher Häufigkeit wird z.B. alphabetisch sortiert. Damit ergibt sich eine eindeutige Reihenfolge. Sortiere Transaktionen nach den Items innerhalb der Transaktionen. Aufbau des FP-Trees Aufbau des Baums Aufbau der Header-Tabelle: Absteigend eindeutig nach Häufigkeit sortiert Starte mit dem niedrigsten Element in der Header-Tabelle. Überprüfe den Präfix auf den erwarteten Support. Gehe dazu alle Elemente dieses Items durch (alle Präfix-Pfade im Baum) und wende eine Art Apriori-Algorithmus an um in diesen Präfix-Pfaden mit dem Item $i$ die Frequent-Itemsets zu finden. Siehe auch: Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation und ein sehr guter Blog post Sampling Berechnung auf einer Stichprobe durchführen Negative Border Die negative border ist abhängig vom minimalen geforderten Support. Wenn dieser Schwellenwert größer wird, wandert die negative border nach oben; es gibt also weniger frequent Itemsets. Projected Database Zerlegung des Datenbestands in Partitionen (z.B. Transaktionen mit Item A und Transaktionen ohne Item A). Siehe auch: Market Basket Analysis with R Market Basket Analysis and Recommendation Engines Constraints Slides: 8-ConstrainedAssociationRules.pdf Constraint-Typen Data Constraints: Einschränken auf konkrete Werte, z.B. Transaktionen bei denen der Ort Karlsruhe ist. Rule Constraints: z.B. nur Itemsets der Größe 3 1-var Constraint Nur eine Seite (links oder rechts) der Association Rule wird eingeschränkt. 2-var Constraint Beide Seiten (links und rechts) der Association Rule werden eingeschränkt. Anti-Monotonizität Ein 1-var Constraint heißt anti-monoton, wenn für alle Mengen $S, S'$ gilt: $$(S \\supseteq S' \\land (S \\text{ erfüllt } C )) \\Rightarrow S' \\text{ erfüllt } C$$ Wenn also ein Constraint $C$ für eine Menge $S$ erfüllt ist, dann auch für jede Teilmenge $S'$. Beispiele: $\\min(S) \\geq v, \\;\\;\\; v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ ist anti-monoton $\\max(s) \\geq v, \\;\\;\\; v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ ist nicht anti-monoton $\\text{size}(s) \\leq v, \\;\\;\\; v \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ist anti-monoton $\\text{size}(s) \\geq v, \\;\\;\\; v \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ist nicht anti-monoton Anti-Monotonizität ist eine gutartige Eigenschaft von Constraints. Hier kann das Constraint sehr früh überprüft werden. Succinctness Ein Constraint heißt succinct, wenn alle Itemsets die es erfüllen schnell erzeugt werden können. Beispiel: Man hat das Constraint, dass der Typ \"Non-Food\" sein soll. Aber es gibt nur 3 Produkte die diesen Typ haben. Kandidaten, die das Constraint nicht erfüllen werden gar nicht erst erzeugt. Meta-Rule Guided mining Constraint durch schwächeres Anti-Monotones Constraint ersetzen. Clustering Slides: 9-Clustering-1.pdf und 9-Clustering-2.pdf Silhouette-Koeffizient Sei $C = (C_1, \\dots, C_k)$ ein Clustering. Durchschnittlicher Abstand zwischen Objekt o und anderen Objekten in seinem Cluster: $$a(o) = \\frac{1}{|C(o)|} \\sum_{p \\in C(o)} dist(o, p)$$ Durchschnittlicher Abstand zum zweitnächsten Cluster: $$b(o) = \\min_{C_i \\in \\text{Cluster} \\setminus C(o)}(\\frac{1}{C_i}) \\sum_{p\\in C_i} \\sum_{p \\in C_i} \\text{dist}(o, p)$$ Silhouette eines Objekts: $$s(o) = \\begin{cases}0 &\\text{if } a(o) = 0, \\text{i.e. } |C_i|=1\\\\ \\frac{b(o)-a(o)}{\\max(a(o), b(o))} &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$ Es gilt: $$s(o) \\in [-1, 1]$$ $\\text{silh}(C) = \\frac{1}{|C|} \\sum_{C_i \\in C} \\frac{1}{|C_i|} \\sum_{o \\in C_i} s(o)$. Es gilt: $$\\text{silh}(C) \\in [-1; 1]$$ Es ist ein möglichst großer Wert gewünscht. Alles kleiner als 0 ist schlecht. Distanzfunktionen für Cluster Seien $X, Y$ Cluster. Durschnittlicher Objektabstand: $\\text{dist}_{avg}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{|X| \\cdot |Y|} \\cdot \\sum_{x in X, y\\in Y} \\text{dist}(x, y)$ Single Link: $\\text{dist}_{sl}(X, Y) = \\min_{x \\in X, y \\in Y} \\text{dist}(x, y)$ Complete Link: $\\text{dist}_{cl}(X, Y) = \\max_{x \\in X, y \\in Y} \\text{dist}(x, y)$ $k$-means Clustering Siehe ML 1 . CLARANS CLARANS (Clustering Lge AplicationNs based on RANdomized Search) ist ein Clustering-Algorithmus, der mit $k$-Means verwandt ist. Auch er erwartet einen Parameter $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, der die erwartete Anzahl an Clustern angibt. Dann geht CLARANS davon aus, dass jeder Medeoid durch einen Datenpunkt im Datensatz repräsentiert werden kann. Für eine zufällige Wahl von $k$ Punkten $M = \\{p_1, \\dots, p_k\\}$ wird ein Score berechnet. Dann überprüft man, was der Tausch eines Punktes $p_i$ durch den Punkt $p_j$ für beliebige $p_i \\in M$ und $p_j \\notin M$ am Score ändern würde. Den besten Tausch führt man durch. Siehe auch: CLARANS: a method for clustering objects for spatial data mining CF-Tree ( Clustering Feature Tree ) Ein CF-Tree ist ein höhenbalancierter Baum. Jeder Knoten des Baums entspricht ein Cluster. Clustering-Feature (N, LS, SS) für Cluster $C_i$ mit $N = |C_i|$: Anzahl der Punkte im Cluster $LS = \\sum_{i \\in C_i} X_i$ $SS = \\sum_{i \\in C_i} X_i&#94;2$ BIRCH ( Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies ) BIRCH ist ein Clustering-Algorithmus, welcher CF-Trees benutzt und mit wenig Speicherplatz auskommt. Der CF-Tree wird im ersten Schritt aufgebaut. Parameter von BIRCH: $k \\in \\mathbb{N}&#94;+$: Anzahl der Cluster $B \\in \\mathbb{N}&#94;+$: (Fan-out), maximale Anzahl an Kindknoten $B' \\in \\mathbb{N}&#94;+$: maximale Blatt-Kapazität (Anzahl Elementarcluster) $T \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;+$ (Schwellwert): Maximaler Radius (oder Durchmesser), bevor ein Elementar-Cluster gesplittet wird Siehe auch: YouTube (7:24min) BIRCH: an efficient data clustering method for very large databases Hierarchisches Clustering Beim hierarchischen Clustern werden Datenpunkte Baumartig zu Clustern zusammengefasst. Das ganze sieht einem Abstammungsbaum der Arten in der Biologie sehr ähnlich. Es gibt zwei Vorgehensweisen: Agglomorativ Divisives Clustering Dendrogramme sind eine typische Visualisierung für das Ergebnis einer hierarchischen Clusteranalyse. Probabilistisches Clustering Datenobjekte werden nicht hart zu einem Cluster zugeordnet sondern weich (also mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit) jedem Cluster zugeordnet. Zentrum eines Clusters $$Z_{i} = \\frac{1}{|C_i|} \\sum_{i \\in C_i} X_i$$ Radius eines Clusters Der Radius enes Centroids ist der durchschnittliche Abstand zum Centroiden: $$R(C_i) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{|C_i|} \\sum_{j \\in C_i} {(X_j - Z_i)}&#94;2}$$ Durchmesser eines Clusters Der Durchmesser eines Centroiden ist die durchschnittle paarweise Distanz: $$D(C_i) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{|C_i| \\cdot (|C_i|-1)} \\sum_{j \\in C_i} \\sum_{k \\in C_i} {(X_j - X_k)}&#94;2}$$ Interclusterdistanz Durchschnittliche Inter-Clusterdistanz von Cluster 1 und Cluster 2: $$D(C_1, C_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i \\in C_1} \\sum_{j \\in C_2} {(X_i - X_j)}&#94;2}{|C_1| \\cdot |C_2|}}$$ Agglomeratives Clustering Jedes Objekt ist ein Cluster. Füge die Cluster in die Menge $M$ ein. Berechne alle paarweise Abstände zwischen Clustern in $M$. Das ist in $\\mathcal{O}(|M|&#94;2)$. Merge das Paar $A, B$ mit kleinstem Abstand zu $C = A \\cup B$. Entferne $A, B$ aus $M$ und füge $C$ ein. Abbruch, wenn $|M| = 1$ Gehe zu Schritt 2. Gesamtkomplexität: $\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)$ Siehe auch: AGNES Divisives Clustering ( DIANA , DIvisive ANAlysis ) Divisives Clustering ist ein hierarchisches Clusteringverfahren. Es startet mit einem großen Cluster und unterteilt diesen rekursiv immer weiter in je zwei kleine Cluster. Das Unterteilen funktioniert wie folgt: Wähle in einem Cluster $C$ das Datenobjekt $o$, welches den höchsten durchschnittlichen Abstand von allen anderen Datenobjekten $o' \\in C \\setminus \\{o\\}$ hat. Dieses ist nun das erste Objekt einer neu erstellten sogenannten Splittergruppe $S = \\{o\\}$ (engl. splinter group ). Nun gibt es noch das Maß $$D(o) = \\sum_{o' \\in C \\setminus S} \\frac{d(o, o')}{|C \\setminus S|} - \\sum_{o'} \\frac{d(o, o')}{|S|}$$ Solange $D(o) > 0$ für ein $o \\in C \\setminus S$ wird $o&#94;* = \\text{arg max}_{o \\in C \\setminus S} D(o)$ aus dem Cluster in die Splittergruppe gesteckt. Siehe auch: R implementierung Leonard Kaufman, Peter J. Rousseeuw: Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. Projected Clustering Input sind die Anzahl $k$ der Cluster, die gefunden werden sollen und die durchschnittliche Anzahl der Dimensionen pro Cluster $l$. Output ist eine Partitionierung der Daten in $k+1$ Mengen Manhatten Segmental Distance $d(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n |x_1&#94;{(i)} - x_2&#94;{(i)}|$ wobei $n$ die Anzahl der Dimensionen von $x_1, x_2$ ist. Link-based Clustering Connect all data objects which are closter than $d$ Remove all data objects which have less than $c$ edges Clusters are now connected data objects. The removed elements are noise. Jaccard Koeffizient $$J(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|} \\in [0; 1]$$ DBSCAN DBSCAN ist ein Algorithmus zum finden von Clustern. Er unterscheidet 3 Arten von Datenpunkten: Dichte Objekte: Epsion-Umgebung hat viele Datenobjekte. Dichte-erreibare Objekte: In Epsilon-Umgebung von dichten Objekt. Ausreißer: Weder dicht noch dichte-erreichbar. Idee: Gehe über alle Punkte $p \\in P$ genau ein mal. Sei $P' \\leftarrow P$ die Menge der nicht-markierten Punkte. Solange $|P'| > 0$ wird ein Punkt entnommen. Ist er dicht, so ist es ein neues Cluster. Von diesem Punkt aus wird rekursiv alles in der $\\varepsilon$-Umgebung zum Cluster hinzugefügt. Hat der Punkt weniger als min_point Punkte in seiner $\\varepsilon$-Umgebung, so wird er als Ausreißer markiert. Siehe auch: A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise Noise Noise sind Punkte, die zu keinem Cluster gehören. Outlier Noise, welcher weit von jedem Objekt entfernt ist. Core-Distanz $C(o) = \\min\\{\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R} | o \\text{ ist mit DBSCAN und } \\varepsilon \\text{ dicht}\\}$. Die Core-Distanz eines Objekts $o$ ist also die kleinste Distanz, sodass $o$ noch ein dichtes Objekt ist. Reachability-Distanz Seien $p, o$ Datenpunkte. $$\\text{reach\\_d}(p, o) = \\begin{cases}\\max(d(p, o), \\text{coreDist}(p, o)) &\\text{if } d(p, o) < \\varepsilon\\\\ \\text{undefined} &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$ OPTICS OPTICS ist ein Algorithmus, der mit den Parametern min_points und $\\varepsilon$ (maximaler Radius für Cluster-Distanz) automatisch Cluster findet. Er startet dabei bei einem beliebigen Punkt. Dieser Punkt definiert ein Cluster, wenn mindestens min_points von ihm aus maximal $\\varepsilon$ entfernt sind. Dann wird der naheste Punkt zu dem Cluster hinzugefügt. Dies wird so lange gemacht, wie die Punkte maximal $\\varepsilon$ von einem Punkt im Cluster entfernt sind. Dann wird ein bisher nicht betrachteter Punkt als genommen und man macht für diesen Outlier / neuen Cluster so weiter wie zuvor. ControlList (Priority Queue) enthält nur Objekte, die noch nicht in der Output-Liste sind. Kriterium: Minimale reachability-distanz zu Objekten in der Output-Liste. Rekursiv expandieren wie bei DBSCAN. Siehe OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure Why does OPTICS use the core-distance as a minimum for the reachability distance? Reachability-Plot ( Erreichbarkeitsdiagramm ) Der Reachability-Plot veranschaulicht die Cluster und zeigt, welche Wahl von $\\varepsilon$ zu verschiedenen Clustern in DBSCAN führen würde. Er veranschaulicht das Ergebnis von OPTICS. OPTICS: Der Reachability-Plot ist ganz unten. EM-Algorithmus ( Expectation Maximization ) Siehe ML 2 . Overall Likelihood Die Overall Likelihood ist ein Gütemaß für Clusterings. $$\\prod_{i} \\left ( p_A P(x_i | A) + p_B P(x_i | B) \\right )$$ Clustering-Algorithmen Im Folgenden sei \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) die Anzahl der Cluster, \\(d \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) die Dimension der \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) Datenpunkte.

ML 1 ) Ensembles Mehrere Instanzen auf Trainingsdaten trainieren. Vorteile: Overfitting wird minimiert &rightarrow; Besseres Gesamtsystem Parallelisierbarkeit Wahrscheinlichkeiten können genauer geschätzt werden Typische Techniken sind Bagging und Boosting. Bagging Ensemble-Learning Technik, bei der Stichproben des Trainingsdatenbestandes für die Classifier verwendet werden. Relabeling Überschreiben der Originalen Labels, z.B. wenn man eine Attributkombination mehrfach hat, aber mit unterschiedlichen Labels, dann kann dieser Kombination mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit das jeweilige Label zugewiesen werden. MetaCost MetaCost ist ein Verfahren zum Relabeling, welches Bagging anwendet. MetaCost: a general method for making classifiers cost-sensitive ( summary ) Boosting Boosting ist eine Ensemble-Learning-Technik, die mehrere Modelle vom gleichen Typ durch Voting / Durchschnittsberechnung kombiniert. Dabei nimmt Boosting Rücksicht auf zuvor falsch Klassifizierte Beispiele und gewichtet diese stärker. Gewichtungsänderung für korrekte Objekte bei Fehllerrate e: $\\frac{e}{1-e}$ Prüfungsfragen Was ist Overfitting? → Siehe ML 1 Wie berechnet man die Covarianz zweier Zufallsvariablen \\(X, Y\\) ? → \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) := \\operatorname E\\bigl[(X - \\operatorname E(X)) \\cdot (Y - \\operatorname E(Y))\\bigr]\\) Warum muss man für NN-Anfragen mit kD-Bäumen nur ein paar Rechtecke anschauen? → Weil man mit der Priority-Queue Algorithmus nur Rechtecke betrachten muss, die von der Sphäre, welchen durch den Anfragepunkt un den tatsächlichen nachsten Nachbarn gebildet wird, geschnitten werden. Warum kann man für räumliche Anfragen nicht ohne weiteres auswerten, wenn man für jede Dimension separat einen B-Baum angelegt hat? → Fragestellung nicht klar. War B-Baum und nicht R-Baum / kdB-Baum gemeint? Wie ist ein R-Baum aufgebaut? → Siehe oben . Wie funktioniert die Suche nach dem nächsten Nachbarn mit dem R-Baum? → Man fügt den Wurzel-Knoten in eine Priority-Queue ein. Die Priority-Queue ist eine Min-Queue mit dem Abstand vom Anfragepunkt. Es wird im folgenden so lange das höchstpriore Objekt aus der Queue entfernt Was ändert sich, wenn die Objekte eine räumliche Ausdehnung haben? → Man splittet nach mehreren Dimensionen. Stören uns Überlappungen von Knoten des R-Baums? Wenn ja, warum? → Ja, weil die Suche nach dem nächsten Nachbarn ineffizienter wird. Es müssen gegebenenfalls mehr Knoten betrachtet werden. Wie unterscheiden sich R-Baum, kD-Baum und kDB-Baum? → R-Bäume partitionieren im gegensatz zu kD- und kDB-Bäumen den Datensatz nicht. kDB-Bäume sind im Gegensatz zu kD-Bäumen auf physischer Ebene balanciert. Wie funktioniert das Einfügen in den R-Baum, inklusive Split? → Siehe Pseudocode Was für Anfragen unterstützen die diversen räumlichen Indexstrukturen? → Nearest-Neighbor, Bereichsanfragen, Punktanfrage 3-Informatik-Grundlagen.pdf , Folie 19 Warum werden bei der NN-Suche nur genau die Knoten inspiziert, deren Zonen die NN-Sphere überlappen? → Weil alle anderen Knoten in der Priority Queue weiter hinten liegen. Welche Classifier kennen Sie? → Decision Stumps (1-Rules), Entscheidungsbäume, SVMs, Neuronale Netze, \\(k\\) -nearest neighbor (es gibt mehr Classifier ) Was ist der Vorteil von Postpruning verglichen mit Prepruning? → Es könnte sein, dass ein Feature nur in Kombination mit einem anderen deutliche Vorteile bringt. Dies kann man bei Prepruning nicht erkennen, ist bei Postpruning gegebenenfalls jedoch offensichtlich. Wie baut man einen Entscheidungsbaum auf? → Gehe durch alle Attribute. Finde für jedes einzelne Attribut den Wert, der die niedrigste Schnitt-Entropie hat. Nehme dann das Attribut als Split-Attribut, welches die niedrigste Schnitt-Entropie hat. Fahre so mit den beiden Kindknoten fort, bis ein Abbruchkriterium erfüllt ist. Das könnte z.B. eine Entropie von 0 oder eine maximale Tiefe sein. Wie kann man Overfitting beim Aufbau eines Entscheidungsbaums berücksichtigen? → Prepruning oder Postpruning. Wie kann man beim Aufbau des Entscheidungsbaums berücksichtigen, dass unterschiedliche Fehlerarten unterschiedlich schlimm sind? → Mehr Trainingsdaten für den schlimmeren Fehler. (vgl. How can decision trees be tuned for non-symmetrical loss? ) Was ist Wertebereich der FP-Rate? → [0, 1]: Die FP-Rate ist definiert als \\(\\frac{FP}{FP+TN}\\) . Offensichtlich sind alle Werte nicht-negativ, also kann der Bruch nicht negativ werden. Deshalb ist auch der Nenner mindestens so groß wie der Zähler. Wenn TN=0 und \\(FP \\neq 0\\) , dann ist die FP-Rate gleich 1. Das geht, wenn man z.B. immer \"True\" vorhersagt. Wenn man immer \"False\" vorhersagt ist die FP-Rate gleich 0. Wie berechnet man den Korrelationskoeffizienten? → vgl. oben Was ist die \"10-fold cross validation\"? → vgl. oben Wie haben wir die Erfolgsquote definiert? → vgl. oben Was ist ein Lift Chart? → Ein Lift Chart hat auf der x-Achse den Rang (Top-k) und auf der y-Achse der Gewinn. Die x-Achse verläuft von 0 bis 100% und die y-Achse von 0 bis zum maximalen Gewinn im Datenbestand. Die Diagonale von (0, 0) nach (100%, Maximaler Gewinn) entspricht Raten, alles über der Diagonalen ist positiv. Der Lift-Chart muss nicht monoton steigend sein. Wie unterscheidet sich ein Lift Chart von der ROC Kurve? → Die ROC-Kurve ist monoton steigend, der Lift-Chart jedoch nicht. Was für Fehlerarten gibt es bei Vorhersagen von Klassenzugehörigkeiten? → False-Positive, False-Negative (oder: Konfusionsmatrix) Was für Kennzahlen kennen Sie, die diese Fehlerarten sämtlich berücksichtigen? → F score und Gesamtfehler. Was ist Unterschied zwischen Kovarianz und dem Korrelationskoeffizienten? → Der Korrelationskoeffizient ist normiert (vgl. oben ) Warum kommt bei der informational loss Funktion die Logarithmusfunktion zur Anwendung? → Die Logarithmusfunktion hat die gewünschte Form: Bei perfekter Klassifizierung soll der Loss gleich 0 sein. Wenn es nicht perfekt ist, also \\(0 \\leq p_i < 1\\) , dann soll der Loss streng monoton fallen. Association Rules Was sind Association Rules? → Association Rules sind im Kontext von Transaktionen von Items zu verstehen. Eine Association Rule ist eine Regel \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) , wobei A und B Item-Mengen sind. Wie findet man Association Rules? → In der Warenkorbanalyse / in Transaktionen. Wie überprüft man rasch für viele Transaktionen, welche Kandidaten sie enthalten? → FP-Trees Wie muss der Datenbestand beschaffen sein, damit eine Association Rule \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) hohen Support und hohe Confidence hat? → Viele Transaktionen müssen \\(A \\cup B\\) enthalten. Wenn \\(A\\) vorkommt, muss auch \\(B\\) häufig vorkommen. Wie muss der Datenbestand beschaffen sein, damit eine Association Rule \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) hohen Support und geringe Confidence hat? → Viele Transaktionen müssen \\(A \\cup B\\) enthalten, aber noch deutlich mehr nur \\(A\\) . Wie muss der Datenbestand beschaffen sein, damit eine Association Rule \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) geringen Support und hohe Confidence hat? → Wenige Transaktionen müssen \\(A \\cup B\\) enthalten, wenn \\(A\\) mal vorkommt, dann immer auch \\(B\\) . Wie muss der Datenbestand beschaffen sein, damit eine Association Rule \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) geringen Support und geringe Confidence hat? → Wenige Transaktionen müssen \\(A \\cup B\\) enthalten. Wenn \\(A\\) mal vorkommt, dann sehr selten auch \\(B\\) . Im Apriori-Algorithmus hat man bei k=2 keinen Prune-Schritt. Warum? → (Antwort: 24.11.2015, 14:34) Wie groß sollte man die Hash-Tabelle machen? → So groß wie sinnvoll möglich. Der verfügbare Arbeitsspeicher ist hier eine Grenze. Was sind multidimensionale Association Rules? → Association Rules die auf verschiedenen Begriffsebenenen sind, z.B. Oreo \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Milch Wie findet man multidimensionale Association Rules? → Hinzufügen von Transaktionen der anderen Dimensionen, Nutzen von \"Leveln\" (Encodierte Transaktionstabelle) In welchen Situationen ist Apriori teuer, und warum? → Apriori ist teuer, wenn es sehr große Itemsets gibt. Dann müssen alle darin enthaltenen Itemsets gebildet werden. Was kann man gegen die Schwächen von Apriori tun? → Laufzeit: Hash-Filter, FP-Trees, Apriori-B, Sampling Was sind FP-Trees, und wie lassen sie sich für die Suche nach Frequent Itemsets verwenden? → Erklärung von FP-Trees Was kann man tun, wenn FP-Trees für den Hauptspeicher zu groß sind? → Sampling, Projektion Was ist Constraint-basiertes Mining? → Das minen von Assosication Rules unter Nebenbedingungen. Diese können entweder an die Daten oder an die Regeln gestellt werden. Eine Nebenbedingung an die Daten wäre z.B. dass nur Items betrachtet werden, die mindestens 100 Euro Wert sind. Eine Nebenbedingung an die Regeln wäre, dass es mindestens 3 Elemente auf der rechten Seite sind. Was sind die Vorteile von Constraint-basiertem Association-rule Mining? → Durch die Regeln kann man gegebenenfalls das Minen beschleunigen und für den Nutzer interessantere Regeln finden. Was für Arten von Constraints kennen sie? Beispiele hierfür. → Data-Constraints (Wert der Items über 100 Euro) und Rule-Constraints (min. 3 Elemente auf der rechten Seite). Was ist Anti-Monotonizität, Succinctness? Für ein bestimmtes Constraint sagen/begründen, ob anti-monoton/succinct. → vgl. Anti-Monotonizität , Succinctness Wie lässt sich Apriori für das Mining von Teilfolgen verallgemeinern? → Endlicher Automat Was versteht man unter dem Antagonismus von Support-basiertem und Constraint-basiertem Pruning? → Wenn man A-Rules unter Nebenbedingungen mit dem Apriori-Algorithmus sucht, könnte man versucht sein die Kandidaten schon früh auf die Constraints zu überprüfen. Obwohl jede Teilmenge eines Frequent Itemsets (FI) auch Frequent sein muss, muss nicht für jede Teilmenge das Constraint erfüllt sein. Dies gilt jedoch nicht für die Nebenbedingungen. Alternativen für Constraint-basiertes Pruning (wenn Constraint nicht anti-monoton) erklären können. → Support-basiertes Pruning Welche zwei Sprachen haben wir für die Formulierung der Constraints kennengelernt? → 1-var und 2-var bzw. MetaRule Guided Warum ist SQL nicht geeignet um Constraints zu formulieren? → Weil SQL keine Aussage über die Struktur machen kann. So ist es in SQL nicht möglich zu sagen, dass die rechte Seite mindestens 3 Elemente beinhalten soll. Clustering BIRCH-Algorithmus: Wie kann man die Interclusterdistanz aus N, LS, SS herleiten? → \\(R(C_i) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} (SS - 2 \\frac{LS}{N} \\cdot LS + N (\\frac{LS}{N})&#94;2)}\\) BIRCH-Algorithmus: Wie kann man den Durchmesser aus N, LS, SS herleiten? → \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N \\cdot (N-1)} (N \\cdot SS - 2 LS&#94;2 + N&#94;2 \\cdot SS)}\\) BIRCH-Algorithmus: Wie kann man die Interclusterdistanz aus N, LS, SS herleiten? → \\(D(C_1, C_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{C_1} - 2 LS_{C_2} LS_{C_1} + SS_{C_2}}{N_{C_1} \\cdot N_{C_2}}}\\) BIRCH-Algorithmus: Wie lassen sich die Clustering-Features eines Zusammengefügten Clusters \\(C_{12} = C_1 \\cup C_2\\) aus den Komponenten berechnen? → Durch Addition der jeweiligen Features der Einzelcluster. Was spricht dagegen, \\(\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}\\) in OPTICS riesig zu wählen? → Dann sind gleich am Anfang mit dem ersten Objekt alle Datenobjekte in der Priority-Queue. Damit wäre der Aufwand für die Queue zu hoch. Welche Clustering-Verfahren kennen Sie? → \\(k\\) -means , CLARANS , DBSCAN , OPTICS , BIRCH , DIANA , EM Gegeben Szenario X, welche Clustering-Verfahren sind sinnvoll, und warum? → Autohersteller will Anzahl der Teile minimieren um Kosten zu senken (Hierarchisches Clustering), finden von neuen Symbolen. Warum funktionieren herkömmliche Clustering-Verfahren in hochdimensionalen Merkmalsräumen nicht? Skizzieren Sie eine mögliche Lösung. → Weil Datenobjekte in hochdimensionalen Räumen typischerweise alle weit auseinander liegen / nicht dicht sind. Man kann projected Clustering anwenden. Erklären Sie, warum Clustering mit kategorischen Attributen besonders ist? Warum ist Link-basiertes Clustering hier hilfreich? Bayes Gegeben ein beispielhafter Datenbestand, vergleichbar mit dem auf Folie 10, Vorhersage mit Naive Bayes erklären/vorführen können. Was ändert sich, wenn die Attribute nicht voneinander unabhängig sind? → Dann ist die naive Unabhängigkeitsannahme nicht mehr gegeben und man sollte ein bayessches Netz nehmen. Damit lassen sich dann wieder bessere Vorhersagen machen. Material und Links Die Vorlesung wurde gestreamt und ist unter mml-streamdb01.ira.uka.de verfügbar. Vorlesungswebsite Ilias Literatur: Ian H.

[ Koe03 ] Es geht dabei um die Frage, wie wir die gefährlichen Überreste der Atomkraftwerke, den sogenannten Atommüll , entsorgen. Atommüll Um zu verstehen worum es geht sollte man ein Grundverständnis für Atomenergie haben. Ich werde die Dinge auf das relevante vereinfachen: Atome bestehen aus dem Atomkern und Elektronen, welche um den Atomkern kreisen. Der Atomkern besteht aus Neutronen und Protonen. Die Protonen sind elektrisch positiv geladen, Elektronen sind negativ geladen und die Neutronen sind elektrisch neutral. Alle diese Elementarteilchen haben Masse. Elektronen sind extrem leicht, Protonen und Neutronen sind etwa gleich schwer und beide jeweils deutlich schwerer als Elektronen. Visualisierung eines Atoms Bildquelle: Wikipedia - Fornax, Halfdan, Groogokk Die Anzahl der Protonen und Elektronen ist gleich, sodass ein Atom insgesamt elektrisch neutral geladen ist. Die Anzahl der Protonen (bzw. Elektronen) macht die wichtigsten Eigenschaften aus. Dementsprechend haben wir eigene Namen für Atome mit einem Proton (Wasserstoff), 26 Protonen (Eisen) oder eben 92 Protonen (Uran). Allerdings ist nicht jedes Uran-Atom gleich: Manche haben mehr Neutronen als andere. So gibt es Uran mit 235 Teilchen im Kern und Uran mit 238 Teilchen im Kern. Die Anzahl der Protonen definiert also welches Element (Eisen, Uran, Wasserstoff, ...) wir haben, die Anzahl der Protonen+Neutronen definiert welches Isotop ( 235 U, 238 U, 1 H, ...) wir haben. Kernkraftwerke produzieren Energie, indem ein bestimmtes Uran-Isotop ( 235 U) dazu gebracht wird sich zu spalten. Wir haben also einen ganz bestimmten Typ von Atom, welchen wir dazu bringen 143 Neutronen und mit 146 Neutronen. Da die Elektronen fast nichts wiegen und nur die Neutronen und Protonen für das Gewicht relevant sind, sagt zählt man üblicherweise beide zusammen: 92 Protonen + 146 Neutronen macht 238 Kernteilchen. Also 238 U, weil U das Zeichen für Uran ist. Es gibt also leichtes Uran 235 U und schweres Uran 238 U. Nun muss man wissen, dass sich Elektronen und Protonen anziehen. Das ist ungefähr so wie mit verschiedenen Polen eines Magnets. Warum fallen sie also nicht in den Kern? Ganz einfach: Es gibt weitere Effekte (siehe details ). Man stelle sich z.B. Satelliten vor, die um die Erde kreisen. Sie sind gerade so schnell und haben gerade die richtige Entfernung, dass sie weder wegfliegen noch in den Kern fallen. Nun kann man sich die nächste Frage stellen: Warum sind die Protonen zusammen? Warum ist der Kern stabil? Genauso wie sich Protonen und Elektronen anziehen, stoßen sich zwei Protonen ab. Hier kommt nun eine weitere, elementare Kraft ins Spiel: Die Kernkraft. Sie wirkt nur auf sehr, sehr kleine Distanzen, ist dort aber unglaublich stark. Sie zieht die Protonen gegenseitig an. Die Anziehung durch die Kernkraft schafft also einen Ausgleich zur elektrischen Abstoßung. Ok, wie kommen nun die Neutronen ins Spiel? Neutronen sind elektrisch neutral. Sie bilden mit den Protonen zusammen den Atomkern. Es scheint so zu sein, dass mehr Neutronen zu einem instabileren Kern führen. Mehr Neutronen machen den Kern größer, aber die Kernkraft wirkt nur auf sehr kurze Entfernung. Das heißt je größer der Kern wird, desto stärker dominiert die elektrische Abstoßung der Protonen. Wenn nun z.B. ein Neutron mit hoher Geschwindigkeit auf den Kern trifft kann sich dieser Spalten. Es bilden sich zwei neue, kleinere Atomkerne und - je nach Atom - werden weitere Neutronen abgestoßen. Man sieht wie ein Neutron (blau) den Atomkern trifft. Dieser Spaltet sich und drei weitere Neutronen fliegen weg. Bildquelle: Stefan-Xp Eine solche Spaltung kann man formal wie folgt darstellen: $$\\mathrm{&#94;{235}_{\\ 92}U + &#94;{1}_{0}n \\longrightarrow &#94;{133}_{\\ 52}Te + &#94;{101}_{\\ 40}Zr + 2\\ &#94;{1}_{0}n}$$ Was diese Gleichung verschweigt, ist die Tatsache, dass auch Energie frei wird. Diese kann man zum erhitzen von Wasser verwenden. Das erhitzte Wasser kann dann wiederum zum Antreiben einer Turbine verwendet werden. Und die Turbine macht schlussendlich aus der Bewegungsenergie nutzbare elektrische Energie. Nun haben wir aber eben auch die kleineren Atomkerne. Diese sind nicht stabil und zerfallen weiter in kleinere Atomkerne. Über diesen Zerfallsvorgang muss man nun wissen, dass er nicht sofort statt findet. Für einzelne Atome kann man auch gar nicht sagen wann genau es sein wird. Allerdings kann man für eine große Menge an Atomen die Aussage machen, dass nach X Jahren die Hälfte davon zerfallen sein wird. Nach weiteren X Jahren wiederum die Hälfte usw. Dieses X ist für einen festen Isotop-Typ konstant. Teilweise ist es im Bereich weniger Sekundenbruchteile, und bei 135 Cs sind es beispielsweise 2,3 Mio. Jahre. Diese Zeit, in der statistisch gesehen die Hälfte der Atome in kleinere Atome zerfällt nennt man Halbwertszeit . Jedes mal wenn so ein Zerfallsvorgang frei wird, wird auch Energie frei bzw. sehr schnelle Teilchen. Man könnte das als eine Art Bombardierung der Umwelt mit sehr kleinen Teilchen sehen. Und bei den Spaltprodukten, dem Atommüll, dauert diese Bombardierung leider sehr lange an. Die Teilchen sind so klein, dass sie leicht eingeatmet werden können. Wenn sie dann im inneren des Körpers zerfallen richten sie dort enormen Schaden an. Es gibt tatsächlich nicht nur eine Art wie sie zerfallen können, sondern drei verschiedene. Bei der ersten, der Alpha-Strahlung, werden vergleichsweise große Teilchen frei, die aber allein schon durch die Luft so schnell und stark abgebremst werden, dass die Teilchen an sich relativ leicht zu handhaben sind. Schon ein Blatt Papier reicht zur Abschirmung. [ Jen ] Beta-Strahlung ist da schon schwerer zu handhaben. Aber auch sie kann z.B. durch 15 Papierblätter / 4mm Aluminium abgehalten werden. [ Jen ] Bleibt noch die Gamma-Strahlung. Diese kann nur abgeschwächt, aber nicht komplett aufgehalten werden. So beleibt bei einer Gamma-Strahlung von 1 MeV nach ca. 3 cm Blei noch ein Zehntel der Strahlung übrig. Ich denke das ist der Grund, warum man den strahlenden Müll gerne Untertage, so weit weg von Menschen wie möglich, lagern will. Endlager: Was müssen sie können? Da die Diskussion um die Endlagerung schon seit 1963 geführt wird, habe ich mich gefragt warum es eigentlich so schwer ist ein Endlager zu finden. Klar, niemand will das Endlager in seiner Nachbarschaft haben. Aber das gilt ja auch für Zwischenlager. Irgendwo muss das Zeug halt stehen. Das Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit hat einen Anforderungskatalog für Endlagerstetten geschrieben. [ BMU10 ] Liest man sich diesen durch, findet man schnell den Grund warum seit über 50 Jahren kein Endlager gefunden wurde: Zur Vermeidung unzumutbarer Lasten und Verpflichtungen für zukünftige Generationen sind folgende Sicherheitsprinzipien zu beachten: 4.6 Das Endlager ist so zu errichten und so zu betreiben, dass für den zuverlässigen langfristigen Einschluss der radioaktiven Abfälle im einschlusswirksamen Gebirgsbereich in der Nachverschlussphase keine Einriffe oder Wartungsarbeiten erforderlich werden. 4.7 Es ist eine möglichst zügige Errichtung des Endlagers zu realisieren. 4.8 Für Errichtung und Betrieb einschließlich Stilllegung des Endlagers müssen die finanziellen Mittel zeitgerecht zur Verfügung stehen. Kapitel 4, Sicherheitsprinzipien, in Sicherheitsanforderungen an die Endlagerung wärmeentwickelnder radioaktiver Abfälle vom 30. September 2010. Von 4.7 kann man sich 16 Jahre nach der Veröffentlichung wohl verabschieden. Die SPD, CDU/CSU hat auch dafür gesorgt, dass 4.8 nicht bedeutet, dass die Energiekonzerne den Betrieb bezahlen. [ Koe03 ] Obwohl das auch mal anders lautete: Die Verantwortung für Stilllegung, Rückbau und Zwischenlagerung des Atommülls liege bei den Energieunternehmen, ließ Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wissen. Deshalb hätten die Konzerne auch \"sämtliche Kosten der Stilllegung, des Rückbaus sowie der Endlagerung zu tragen\". Horand Knaup, in Vorstoß der Energiekonzerne: Milliardenpoker um den Atomausstieg vom 12. Mai 2014. Nun gibt es noch 4.6 der mich besonders stört. Das ist einfach unrealistisch. Natürlich wird man keinen Ort auf der Erde finden bei dem für mehrere Millionen Jahre davon auszugehen ist, dass dieser ohne Eingriffe und Wartungsarbeiten den Müll sicher wegschließt. [ 1 ] Da es immer noch keine wirklich sichere Methode gibt Dinge ins All zu befördern (vgl. Liste von Katastrophen der Raumfahrt ) muss es aber auf der Erde sein. Daher sollte man diesen Punkt einfach streichen. Wir - die aktuelle Generation und alle folgenden Generationen - werden die Lagerung des Atommülls bezahlen müssen. Das beinhaltet Eingriffe und Wartungsarbeiten der Lagerstätte. Soweit die schlechte Nachricht. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass man z.B. Lagerstätten suchen / bauen könnte, bei denen man sich nur sicher ist, dass sie für die nächsten z.B. 5 Jahre sicher sind. Dann prüft man es erneut. Wenn man weiß, dass man die Lagerstätte regelmäßig prüfen muss kann man die Lagerstätte so einrichten, dass diese Prüfung leicht ist. Man könnte Robotersysteme erstellen, welche eine Fernwartung erlauben. Es sollte auf jeden Fall redundante Systeme zur Bergung der Container geben. Die Systeme sollten robust gebaut werden. Wie man an den versagenden Robotern bei Fukushima sieht [ New16 ] müssen die Systeme unbedingt vorher getestet werden. Ich könnte mir Schienen-Systeme für die Container vorstellen. Das sollte recht robust sein. Dann muss man das Gebiet noch bewachen, sodass Menschen nicht Atommüll klauen können. Das wird dauerhaft Geld kosten. Außerdem muss man nicht unbedingt den ganzen Atommüll an einer Stelle lagern. Ich würde es beispielsweise fair finden, wenn die einzelnen Bundesländer so viel von dem Müll lagern müssen wie die Kraftwerke auf ihrem Gebiet erzeugt haben. Aber wie viel Atommüll haben wir eigentlich? Daten zum Atommüll Es ist erstaunlich wie schwer es ist dazu gute Aussagen zu finden. Hier ein paar: Der Restmüll, der in den Wiederaufarbeitungsanlagen neben Plutonium und Uran entsteht, macht zwar nur vier Prozent aus, ist aber das Hauptproblem. In ihm sind 99 Prozent der gefährlichen Strahlung konzentriert. Er wird in flüssiges Glas eingeschmolzen und in sogenannte Kokillen aus Edelstahl gefüllt. Ein 1000-Megawatt-Kraftwerk – deutsche Kernkraftwerke erbringen eine Bruttoleistung zwischen 800 und 1480 Megawatt – produziert jährlich etwa 20 Tonnen ausgedienter Brennelemente. [...] [In Gorleben] liegen nach Angaben des Bundesamtes für Strahlenschutz insgesamt 2408 Glaskokillen aus der Wiederaufarbeitung in der französischen Anlage. [...] Hinzu kommt der hochradioaktive Atommüll, der seit dem Jahr 2005 entstanden ist und nicht wiederaufgearbeitet wurde [...]. Dieser Müll – pro Jahr etwa 400 Tonnen, schätzt die Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit – lagert, verteilt über die ganze Republik, in Hallen neben den Kernkraftwerken. Christina Steinlein, in Focus Online: Die Angst wiegt schwer vom 11. November 2010. Wir haben also mindestens $$11 \\text{ Jahre } \\cdot 400 \\frac{\\text{Tonnen}}{\\text{Jahr}} = 4400\\text{ Tonnen}$$ an Atommüll. Hinzu kommen diese Kokillen von vor 2005, von denen ich leider nicht weiß wie groß die sind. Laut kiefermedia.de haben wir in Deutschland bis 2022 etwas 17 200 Tonnen Atommüll, laut Greenpeace wird es bis dahin 15 000 Tonnen Atommüll geben. Laut BUND sind es 17 000 Tonnen und 300 000 m 3 . [ 2 ] Laut Statistischem Bundesamt sind in Deutschland alleine im Jahr 2009 etwa 450 Tonnen Atommüll angefallen. Diese 450 Tonnen wurden in vielen Quellen als \"Jährlich anfallender Atommüll\" genannt. Als ob das jedes Jahr gleich wäre. Dann hätten wir heute keine ~17 000 Tonnen Atommüll sondern $$(2016-1960) \\cdot 450 \\text{ Tonnen} = 25200\\text{ Tonnen}$$ Siehe auch Kernspaltung Liste der Isotope Fußnoten [ 1 ] Der Homo Sapiens ist etwa 200 000 Jahre alt; die ersten staatlichen Gebilde sind ca. 6000 Jahre alt. Und da wollen wir für etwas planen, was mehr als 100 000 Jahre in der Zukunft liegt? Lächerlich. [ 2 ] Das würde eine Dichte von nur 57 kg/m 3 ergeben.

So here is my answer to all of those requests: I don't work for free. If you want high quality work, you have to pay for it. About me I finished my Computer Science bachelors degree at KIT / CMU and I'm currently in my masters degree at KIT (Karlsruhe, Germany). My mother tongue is German, but my English is not too bad. I'm specialized in Machine Learning. I'm working with the typesetting system LaTeX for quite a while now ( source ). See arxiv for some of my work. Topics When it comes to bachelors thesis, I think I can review probably any topic. This is likely not to be the case when I review a masters thesis. Getting in Touch Just send me an E-Mail ( info@martin-thoma.de ). Make sure to include what you want to be reviewed. Key information I want is: Language of the work (English or German) Type of work (e.g. book, bachelors thesis, masters thesis, paper) Title of the work (e.g. \"A review of Semantic Segmentation\") A short description what it is about. What should I focus on? Spelling, Typos, Grammar Expressions Typesetting Logic, structure and consistency Factual correctness If you want me to review it, you should either send me a PDF or give it to me in printed form directly. I will make annotations in a printed version and give you that. You have to pay in advance (I can give you a receipt if you want). Prices The following prices are rules of thumb. If you want to know what you have to pay, you have to get in touch with me. This is only meant to give you some idea of what it might cost. Especially checking factual correctness thoroughly might cost much more. I make book reviews for 50 Euro / hour or 2.50 Euro / page (as you like). If you want me to review your bachelors or masters thesis, I'll do so for 30 Euro / hour or 1.50 Euro / page. Hints The higher the quality of your work is, the more you will get for your money from my review. So check your stuff first. Ideas what might be wrong give the following tools Text-Based: Academic-Writing-Check aspell LaTeX Searching for \"Warning\" in the LaTeX log Search for \"?\" in the PDF to find missing references Try the package nag (see How to use nag ) My Copy-Paste answer for dubious E-Mails Dear Sir or Madam, Yes, I am interested in writing a review for your work.

They feel that politics favors rich people; that their lives get harder; that big companies profit from political decisions. Their reaction: Not voting / voting blank / voting invalid. This is an awful idea because of the following reasons: Blank votes and invalid votes are treated just the same way as not voting, although the number might get counted ( source ). If you're not voting, the people who vote get more influence with their votes. This means by not voting, you're effectively voting for the current situation. What are your alternatives? Get active. Have a closer look at the parties. On wahl-o-mat.de you can see 22 parties with some elected positions. You don't have to agree 100% for all questions.

If enough people demand a certain position, they might change. Make your own party. This is always a possibility. Find other people who think the same way.

Bush started the War on Terror as a response to the September 11 attacks on the United States in September 2001. Since then, surveillance laws were passed and multiple military operations were started. The US and its allies fought wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The US and its allies supported wars in Syria. US drones killed people in Parkistan and Yemen . Those activities come with a cost. One the one hand, every single of Britain's air-to-surface Brimstone missiles cost £100 000. Britain has fired at least 9 missiles in Syria so far, but not killed a single terrorist ( source ). From the same article: Two jihadists were killed with Paveway IV laser-guided bombs (20,000 US-Dollar each) and five were killed by US-made Hellfire missiles (70,000 US-Dollar a piece) fired from Reaper UAVs. Another article : American aircraft fired at least 23,144 bombs and missiles in 2015 alone, according to data compiled by Micah Zenko, an expert on U.S. military planning and operations who is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Now you should also know that one hour of a Eurofighter in air costs 73992 Euro ( source ). The refugee crisis will cost Germany approximately 50 000 000 000 Euro. ( source ). In 2013, American taxpayers spent 454 million US-Dollars on detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, which now holds 91 detainees ( source ). Effectiveness We are spending much more than ever on fighting terrorism. We sacrificed a lot of our civil rights. What did we get so far? More terrorism than ever before ( sources ). Empathy To understand the effect of those missiles of the people living there, you have to be empathetic. Imagine you're in a situation where not everything might be good (or even very little might be as you like it), but you are essentially \"safe\". You know how you have to behave and you know what you can expect. Now the US brings freedom to your country. The people which were in power once are not anymore. Drones could kill you on your wedding ( source ), when you try to bury loved ones ( source ). The US goes, other people get to the power. Not the ones where you know what to expect from. People who are angry at what happened. People who tell you that it was the US who killed friends or who just destabilized the country. Who tortures people ( sources ). Who just came there for their own interest. Who said they wanted to bring freedom, but came for the oil ( sources ). But who overthrew democratically elected governments ( sources ). I'm not saying all of those statements are true. Yes, I'm aware that there is context missing. However, it really doesn't matter. While people being in such a situation might know more about their specific case, they will almost certainly also only have those vague ideas what is going on. To their eyes, it is the US who caused the trouble. Why should you care? The point I want to make here is that there is no good in fighting with weapons (only). In case you will ever be in the position to decide that, keep it in mind. In case there is an anti-war demonstration nearby, think about it. What can we do? Terrorism is a problem. I do understand that people don't want to just accept 9/11. Or the attacks in Paris. And it will only get worse. Getting more advances in technology has many advantages, but a downside is that it also gets much more easy to plan and execute terrorist attacks. There is no way to live in a free high-tech world and preventing people from being able to execute horrendous attacks. Especially, simply going to war isn't solving that problem. We have to understand why people are doing what they are doing. Don't prevent the attack, make people not having reasons to make attacks. This is much harder. It needs a deep understanding of what drives people. It needs empathy, diplomacy, support. Contact. Showing people that you care about them. That achieving basic goals to help them lead a better live is worth the money (for example: below 35-76 billion US dollars for the millennium goals ( source ) compared to 468 billion US dollars for 2001-2011 in Iraq). Achieving those goals might include sending the army. But not as the main thing to do, but as a supporting force. To protect people who help building lasting structures. TL;DR Stop war. Think what we want to achieve, think of the most likely outcomes of your foreign policy steps. From the beginning of your foreign policy until you leave the country on their own. Think of other peoples interests, not only of yours.

Warum der Wasserrohrbruch passiert ist wissen die Stadtwerke noch nicht. edit: Hier ein paar Informationen von der Website ( Quelle ): Am Samstag um 9:43 Uhr kam es zum Bruch einer Haupt-Trinkwasserleitung in der Karlsruher Waldstadt. Die Leitung hat einen Durchmesser von 60 cm, stammt aus dem Jahr 1962 und hat normalerweise eine Lebensdauer von rund 90 Jahren. Warum es zum Bruch kam, steht noch nicht fest. Die Leitung wurde inzwischen abgesperrt, die Aufgrabungen beginnen am Montag. Alle Haushalte sind inzwischen wieder mit Wasser versorgt, der Druck im gesamten Stadtnetz hat sich normalisiert. Haushalte, die aktuell noch Probleme mit dem Wasserdruck haben, melden sich bitte telefonisch bei der Störungsstelle unter 599-12. Oft sind die Filter der Hausinstallation verstopft und müssen gereinigt werden. Enormer Wasserverlust Aus der gebrochenen Leitung flossen über 1 Million Liter Wasser. Das ist rund ein Drittel so viel Wasser wie ganz Karlsruhe in einer Stunde verbraucht. Durch den enormen Wasserverlust kam es im gesamten Stadtnetz zu einem Druckverlust und damit zu Einschränkungen in der Wasserversorgung. Normalerweise liegt der Druck bei 4 bis 5 bar, in den westlichen und südlichen Stadtteilen fiel er auf 2 bis 3 bar, in Durlach auf 1,3 bar und in der Waldstadt auf 0,1 bar, so dass dort kaum noch Wasser aus den Leitungen kam. Außerdem wurden im Umfeld der Störungsstelle in der Waldstadt einige Keller überflutet. Sie wurden von der Feuerwehr ausgepumpt. Leider kam es parallel zum Wasserrohrbruch zu einer technischen Störung der Stadtwerke-Server, so dass die Homepages der Stadtwerke und der Stadtwerke Netzservice Gesellschaft längere Zeit nicht erreichbar waren. edit: Es stellt sich heraus, dass es wohl ein Materialfehler war ( Quelle ). Update, 12:20 Bei mir läuft das Wasser wieder. Ich war gerade bei der Stelle, wo der Wasserrohrbruch passiert sein soll. Es waren ca. 10 Feuerwehrleute, 2 Polizisten, 2 Pressesprecher und 2 Redakteure da. Dafür, dass so viele Leute davon betroffen sind erstaunlich wenige. Und man hat im Prinzip kein Wasser gesehen. In der Nähe der Stelle ist eine große Baustelle, aber es waren keine Bauarbeiter dort. Auf meine Nachfrage, warum die Leitung kaputt gegangen ist gab es nur ein Achselzucken: \"Das passiert halt manchmal.\" Bisher habe ich (ohne groß darüber nachzudenken) gedacht, dass das \"Netzwerkproblem\" für das Internet, für Güter und Waren (Zug- und Straßennetzwerke) und für Wasser im Grunde sehr ähnlich ist (was anfälligkeiten für Ausfälle von Quellen / Knotenpunkten / Kanten angeht). Ein wesentlicher Unterschied der mir bis gerade eben so nicht bewusst war ist die Tatsache, dass ein Rohrbruch als neue extreme Senke zu modellieren ist. Es ist also nicht einfach das Entfernen eines Knotens / einer Kante, sondern das Ersetzen einer Kante durch eine Senke.

You want to predict all missing values. This means you want to say how the users would rate movies they have not actually rated. Please note that ratings for products on Amazon might be a very similar situation. It might also be similar to the StumbleUpon rating. The Problem Much Data : You have 17 000 movies, 480 000 users and 100 000 000 ratings of movies by those users. Missing Data : Although you have a lot of ratings, a complete dataset would be \\(17\\cdot 10&#94;3 \\cdot 480 \\cdot 10&#94;3 = 8160 \\cdot 10&#94;6\\) ratings. This means you only have about 12% of all possible ratings. There is a lot of data missing. A Solution Train one RBM per user, but share weights amongst the RBMs. This simply means the weights are averaged. The visible units are movies. But instead of having binary visible units, the units have \\(K=5\\) states on which softmax is applied. The hidden units (about 100) model dependencies between movie ratings. When you now want to predict the missing ratings, you can just perform a sampling in the user-specific RBM. You calculate the values of the hidden units, then you have a vector for this user which describes the users preferences. You add the missing movies with the weights from the other users and sample back. Material Salakhutdinov, Mnih and Hinton: Restricted Boltzmann machines for collaborative filtering .

But what is the best algorithm for a given error function and dataset? I read questions like \"I have problem X. What is the best classifier?\" quite often and my first impulse is always to write: Just try them! I guess people asking this question might think that it is super difficult to do so. However, the sklearn tutorial contains a very nice example where many classifiers are compared ( source ). This article gives you an overview over some classifiers: SVM k-nearest neighbors Random Forest AdaBoost Classifier Gradient Boosting Naive Bayes LDA QDA RBMs Logistic Regression RBM + Logistic Regression Classifier Of course, neural networks are also one very powerful ML classifier I may not forget. As sklearn does not have neural networks, I've installed skflow . Tutorial example The sklearn tutorial creates three datasets with 100 points per dataset and 2 dimensions per point: Moons : Two interleaving half-circles Circles : A larger circle containing the smaller one Linear : A linearly seperable dataset Each of those three datasets has added noise. This means for some points there might be no way of classifying them correclty. Here are the results k nearest neighbors, linear and RBFSVM One can see that k nearest neighbors gives arbitrary decision boundaries. Overall, they look reasonable. However, there are often strange zig-zag patterns. The linear SVM in contrast has a very easy decision boundary: a line. It is no suprise that it can't deal with the moons dataset. Note that a random guess would be right in 50% of the cases. The RBF SVM has very nice decision boundary. It is smooth, matches the pattern and is able to adjust to all three examles. Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost Decision Trees, Decision Forests and AdaBoost all show very similar patterns. The boundaries change in parallel to the coordinate axes which looks very unnatural. Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA Naive Bayes shows nice, smooth patterns. However, those patterns seem to be a bit too simple. LDA is again linear (see linear SVM). Comparing QDA to Naive Bayes is interesting. Although they get similar performance for the first dataset, I would argue that the naive bayes classifier is much better as it is much more confident for its classification. Even more extrem is the last example. I'm astonished that the QDA gets 93% with that boundary; Naive Bayes seems to find a much better boundary. The hardware The following comparison is done on a PC with an Intel i7-4820K CPU and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan Black GPU. MNIST MNIST is a dataset of \\(28\\text{px} \\times 28\\text{px}\\) greyscale images. Each of the images contains a digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The task is to classify the image into one of the 10 digit classes. Guessing randomly will give an accuracy of \\(\\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\\) . Neural Networks Please note that there are neural networks which get much better accuracy. Most notably the MNIST Expert tutorial with 99.2% accuracy.

Random Forests and SVMs are also a model a type of model one should think of. However, the standard implementation is very slow compared to neural networks. sklearn.lda.LDA might also be worth a try. The rest seems to be quite bad compared with those classifiers. The code which generated the examples from above is here .","tags":"Machine Learning","title":"Comparing Classifiers"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/function-approximation/","text":"I was recently quite disappointed by how bad neural networks are for function approximation (see How should a neural network for unbound function approximation be structured? ). However, I've just found that Gaussian processes are great for function approximation! There are two important types of function approximation: Interpolation : What values does the function have in between of known values? Extrapolation : What values does the function have outsive of the known values? I did a couple of very quick examples which look promising. Examples Square Approximating \\(f(x) = x&#94;2\\) worked very good: f(x) = x&#94;2 I've tried if with higher order polynomials, more complex polynomials. No problem. Sin Approximating \\(f(x) = \\sin(3x)\\) seems to be more complicated: f(x) = sin(3x) I guess a human would see the wave pattern and do a better job here. exp Approximating \\(f(x) = e&#94;x\\) works similar well as polynomials. One can see that it does not perfectly fit it, but compared the the range of values seen before and the distance from the last seen value I think this is absolutely acceptable: f(x) = e&#94;x noise It is claimed that Gaussian processes implicitly model noise so that they can easily deal with noise. However, in my experients this seems not to work so great. The reason might be that I had points in \\([-3, 3]\\) of the function $$f(x) = x&#94;2$$ with point-wise gaussian noise \\(N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) . So the noise is quite domintant on that intervall. One of the examples where it worked better is: f(x) = x&#94;2 with gaussian noise Make it brake I was a bit suspicious if I had another mistake here. So I wanted it to break. This was the reason why I created the following function $$f(x) = \\begin{cases}x&#94;2 &\\text{if } x \\geq 0\\\\\\\\-1 &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$ Function with discontinuity The predicted value is obviously not correct, but you should note that almost all function values are within the 95% confidence intervall!

Wikipedia sklearn: Gaussian Processes sklearn: Gaussian Processes regression: basic introductory example","tags":"Machine Learning","title":"Function Approximation"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/svm-with-sklearn/","text":"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a group of powerful classifiers. In this article, I will give a short impression of how they work. I continue with an example how to use SVMs with sklearn. SVM theory SVMs can be described with 5 ideas in mind: Linear, binary classifiers : If data is linearly separable, it can be separated by a hyperplane. There is one hyperplane which maximizes the distance to the next datapoints (support vectors). This hyperplane should be taken: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{minimize}_{\\mathbf{w}, b}\\,&\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|&#94;2\\\\ \\text{s.t. }& \\forall_{i=1}&#94;m y_i \\cdot \\underbrace{(\\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i\\rangle + b)}_{\\text{Classification}} \\geq 1 \\end{aligned}$$ Slack variables : Even if the underlying process which generates the features for the two classes is linearly separable, noise can make the data not separable. The introduction of slack variables to relax the requirement of linear separability solves this problem. The trade-off between accepting some errors and a more complex model is weighted by a parameter $C \\in \\mathbb{R}_0&#94;+$. The bigger $C$, the more errors are accepted. The new optimization problem is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{minimize}_{\\mathbf{w}, b}\\,&\\frac{1}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|&#94;2 + C \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m \\xi_i\\\\ \\text{s.t. }& \\forall_{i=1}&#94;m y_i \\cdot (\\langle \\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{x}_i\\rangle + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i \\end{aligned}$$ Note that $0 \\le \\xi_i \\le 1$ means that the data point is within the margin, whereas $\\xi_i \\ge 1$ means it is misclassified. An SVM with $C > 0$ is also called a soft-margin SVM . Dual Problem : The primal problem is to find the normal vector $\\mathbf{w}$ and the bias $b$. The dual problem is to express $\\mathbf{w}$ as a linear combination of the training data $\\mathbf{x}_i$: $$\\mathbf{w} = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m \\alpha_i y_i \\mathbf{x}_i$$ where $y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ represents the class of the training example and $\\alpha_i$ are Lagrange multipliers. The usage of Lagrange multipliers is explained with some examples in [ Smi04 ]. The usage of the Lagrange multipliers $\\alpha_i$ changes the optimization problem depend on the $\\alpha_i$ which are weights for the feature vectors. It turns out that most $\\alpha_i$ will be zero. The non-zero weighted vectors are called support vectors . The optimization problem is now, according to [ Bur98 ] (a great read; if you really want to understand it I can recommend it!): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{maximize}_{\\alpha_i}\\,& \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m \\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m \\sum_{j=1}&#94;m \\alpha_i \\alpha_j y_i y_j \\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle\\\\ \\text{s.t. } & \\forall_{i=1}&#94;m 0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C\\\\ \\text{s.t. } & \\sum_{i=1}&#94;m \\alpha_i y_i = 0 \\end{aligned}$$ Kernel-Trick : Not every dataset is linearly separable. This problem is approached by transforming the feature vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ with a non-linear mapping $\\Phi$ into a higher dimensional (probably $\\infty$-dimensional) space. As the feature vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ are only used within scalar product $\\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle$, it is not necessary to do the transformation. It is enough to do the calculation $$K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle$$ This function $K$ is called a kernel . The idea of never explicitly transforming the vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to the higher dimensional space is called the kernel trick . Common kernels include the polynomial kernel $$K_P(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = (\\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle + r)&#94;p$$ of degree $p$ and coefficient $r$, the Gaussian RBF kernel $$K_{\\text{Gauss}}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = e&#94;{\\frac{-\\gamma\\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\|&#94;2}{2 \\sigma&#94;2}}$$ and the sigmoid kernel $$K_{\\text{tanh}}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\tanh(\\gamma \\langle \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\rangle - r)$$ where the parameter $\\gamma$ determines how much influence single training examples have. Multiple Classes : By using the one-vs-all or the one-vs-one strategy it is possible to get a classifying system which can distinguish many classes. A nice visualization of the transformation of the data in a higher-dimensional space was done by TeamGrizzly's channel: Performing nonlinear classification via linear separation in higher dimensional space on YouTube. 22.11.2010.

The reason might either be a dead battery \\(Y\\) or a blocked fuel pump \\(Z\\) . This results in the following Bayesian Network: A common effect Now assume you know that the engine does not fail ( \\(X=0\\) ). This guarantees that the battery is not dead ( \\(Y=0\\) ) and the fuel pump is not blocked ( \\(Z=0\\) ). However, if the engine failed ( \\(X=1\\) ) it gets more interesting. Let's say the engine works with a probability of 90%. From the graph, you can see that we assume that a dead battery is independant of a blocked fuel pump. Let's also assume that you know that either the fuel pump is blocked or the battery is dead when the engine failed. There is no other option. This makes setting the probability distribution up interesting. There is still 10% left which has to be distributed amongst \\(P(X=1,Y=1,Z=1), P(X=1,Y=1,Z=0), P(X=1,Y=0,Z=1)\\) : X Y Z P(X,Y,Z) comment 0 0 0 0.9 Engine works 0 0 1 0 impossible - blocked fuel pump and working engine 0 1 0 0 impossible - dead battery and working engine 0 1 1 0 impossible - dead battery, blocked fuel pump and working engine 1 0 0 0 impossible - a cause we don't have in our graph 1 0 1 a 1 1 0 b 1 1 1 c However, if you assume that \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are independent, given \\(X\\) , then you would have to set \\(P(Y=0, Z=0|X=1) = P(Y=0|X=1) \\cdot P(Z=0|X=1)\\) which would not be 0 except one of the probabilities would be 0. Or, putting it different again: Given that you know the engine is broken, the event of a dead battery and a blocked fuel pump are suddenly not independent anymore! What does it mean This does not mean there is \"suddenly\" a causatal connection between a dead battery and a blocked fuel pump. It only means you can learn something for your predictions.

Review of 2015 The last year has had it ups and downs. Most of them are private, so I'll not write too much about it. However, I would like to share two of them with you: I've been on my first summer school of the German National Academic Foundation (Sommerakademie der Studienstiftung, see photos ) and I've been for two weeks hiking the west highland way (see photos ). This month was really awesome. Here are some other mentionable facts: I've founded Machine Learning Karlsruhe . See ml-ka.de for more information. I've got 10 000 points on StackOverflow and reached 2.5 million people with my questions and answers ( source ) I've got the funding by the Begabtenstiftung to go with my friend Marvin to Berkeley. Let's see if Berkeley accepts us. I've published 4 papers on arXiv ( link ) (one is still on hold) and started building an academic profile with orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690 . I'm not sure how important that will be, though. I posted 36 articles on my blog in 2015. However, I don't think there is a single good article amongst them. I simply didn't have enough time to write an interesting article ☹. There are 47 drafts from 2015; 134 drafts in total. write-math.com now has 2520 users who contributed something 1595 formulas (that includes simple symbols) 274244 recordings. 6495 of those are not classified yet.

But in contrast to others I like to keep it private. I wish all of you a happy new year! Predictions for 2016 I've just seen Predictions for 2016 on Computational Complexity and thought it is a fun idea. It is currently the 4th of January, so the year is still young enough to not consider this cheating: Machine Learning and Technology Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8 layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30 layers. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear. Machines will generate \"high\" resolution images of at least 256 × 256 pixels. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. See Towel Day , Google Translate Recording , Festival Recording ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to about 900 Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690 Euro). Solar Roadways will make some tiny advances. About Me One of my papers will get cited at least 5 times. I will spend at least 2 weeks abroad. I will publish at leat 40 articles on my blog. I will get a 90 days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is 43 days). I will get 15 000 points on StackExchange (see StackExchange profile ) Politics The European Union will still exist and Britain will still be part of it (see Brexit ). Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the democrat candidate. The republican candidate will get president. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will happen.

See Analyzing PyPI Data for part one. I've recently got a request to expand my analysis of the Python Package Index commonly known as PyPI. It is a repository of Python packages where everybody can upload packages; pretty much without any restriction. In the article Analyzing PyPI Metadata you can read some general stuff about the repository. This article is going a bit more deeper. This time I don't only analyze the metadata, but the relationship of the packages themselves. I wanted to build a dependency graph. However, here is a downside of Pythons package structure: The file which defines the dependencies of a Python package is a Python script itself. This gives the package developer the highest flexibility, but it also gives them the power to execute arbitrary code when I only want to get the dependencies. As I am pretty sure there are some malicious packages in the repository (Although I've never heard of a single one there has to be one. Over 50 000 packages by 2015 - there has to be one!). So I don't want to execute any code of the repository without having at least a clue what it should do. This means my analysis is very simple and thus prone to some errors. Most common single dependency One can see dependencies as being weighted by the number of times a package imports the package. Non-weighted SELECT ` packages ` . ` name ` , COUNT ( ` needs_package ` ) FROM ` dependencies ` JOIN ` packages ` ON ` needs_package ` = ` packages ` . ` id ` GROUP BY ` needs_package ` ORDER BY COUNT ( ` needs_package ` ) DESC LIMIT 20 which gives This bar chart displays which Python modules get imported by most Python packages and without the system packages: SELECT ` packages ` . ` name ` , COUNT ( ` needs_package ` ) FROM ` dependencies ` JOIN ` packages ` ON ` needs_package ` = ` packages ` . ` id ` WHERE ` on_pypi ` = 1 GROUP BY ` needs_package ` ORDER BY COUNT ( ` needs_package ` ) DESC LIMIT 20 which gives This bar chart displays which Python modules (excluding system modules) get imported by most Python packages Weighted How often gets a single module included over all packages? SELECT ` packages ` . ` name ` , SUM ( ` times ` ) FROM ` dependencies ` JOIN ` packages ` ON ` needs_package ` = ` packages ` . ` id ` GROUP BY ` needs_package ` ORDER BY SUM ( ` times ` ) DESC LIMIT 20 2 seconds later I've got the result: Number of imports of Python packages If I'm only interested in the packages which are on PyPI, hence not system packages, I execute the following query: SELECT ` packages ` . ` name ` , SUM ( ` times ` ) FROM ` dependencies ` JOIN ` packages ` ON ` needs_package ` = ` packages ` . ` id ` WHERE ` on_pypi ` = 1 GROUP BY ` needs_package ` ORDER BY SUM ( ` times ` ) DESC LIMIT 20 which gives me about 2 seconds later the following result: Number of imports of Python packages, excluding system packages Non-functional packages Although there are many packages for Python which are very useful, there are also quite a lot which are not usefull at all. One possibility to identify such packages is by checking which packages get neither used by others nor use other packages SELECT ` packages ` . ` id ` , ` name ` FROM ` packages ` WHERE ` id ` in ( SELECT DISTINCT ` dependencies ` . ` package ` FROM dependencies ) OR ` id ` in ( SELECT DISTINCT ` dependencies ` . ` needs_package ` FROM ` dependencies ` ) This leads to the result that 54 900 packages of 67 582 packages are not obviously crap. Or to write it in another way: 11 682 packages are crap. That is 17.5 %. Too much, in my opinion. However, this might also be due to my crappy script not downloading / checking the downloaded files correctly. Names One thing I was interested in while downloading all those packages was the question if there are malicious packages (either on purpose or by accident). One undesirable thing that could happen would be very similar names. Prefixes Let's see how many packages are prefixes of other packages. My thought was that this might be developers trying to get some accidential installs. However, it only showed some relationships. I wanted to make a Levensthein distance analysis, but I guess this is not worth it. Here are the top 10 strings which are prefixes of packages and packages themselves: djan: 6462 pyt: 1626 pyth: 1278 collect: 1155 Flask: 561 open: 474 pyr: 442 pyp: 295 pyra: 285 pym: 256 One interesting thing I've learned is that you can use pip like this: $ pip search \"djan $ \" ... and I found a pip bug ( github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3327 ) Graph analysis Analyzing the dependency graph is quite a challenge. Or at least that was what I initiallly thought. This graph has about 67 582 nodes and 436 980 edges. Quite a bit. Definitely much larger than what I have previously used. However, my friend Nilan who knows a lot about graphs send me a link to StackOverflow: Visualizing Undirected Graph That's Too Large for GraphViz? This lead me to Gephi and the OpenOrd layout plugin. It didn't work for the complete graph (see issues/1207 ), it worked after I removed the single nodes without edges. Now we can ask several standard questions about graphs: How many connected components are there? Are there any circles? (That would be bad... dependency graphs should not have circles. Similar to family trees.) Which are the most central nodes? I didn't find the time to answer those, but I put the graph data in JSON format on github.com/MartinThoma/pypi-dependencies . Please let me know when you do something interesting with the data. I've only got some crappy images with Gephi / GraphViz: Code See github.com/MartinThoma/algorithms . What could come next I would like too measure the overall code quality on PyPI in another post. I think of the following measures: pyroma : A 10-point score for packages package goodness with Cheesecake , pylint PEP8 conformance, Lines of code (LOC) / documentation / whitespace Docstring style (None, NumpyDoc, Sphinx, Google - see Python Code Documentation ) Usage of functions Testing coverage Look for URLs in the code and which are reachable / which are not Look for non-Python files See also Analysis of PyPI K.

I would like to shed some light on it. Initial Research The hardest part is when you're new to a field. You don't know which journals are the important ones, which authors are most respected in the field, which terms are used. Journal Rankings Automated journal rankings like the h5-index used by Google Scholar (see metrics , Wikipedia ) is one way to deal with the lack of domain knowledge. Google Scholar even publishes a list of journals per field (see Top publications in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ). Google Scholar Journal ranking Algorithmic Ideas I've never tried it (on purpose), but the idea just came to my head: Use a random walk. You start with some paper of which you don't really know if it is good. Look at the references and try to weild out the ones which are obviously not work trying (e.g. because they are websites). Now take a random one to continue with. Do this a couple of times. The idea is that papers which are more important are much more often cited. So you can hope to get to more important papers over time. The hard way Search for papers via Google. Look at the references. Search for papers in the reference. Get a feeling for the language being used. Ongoing Research When you have a little bit of domain knowledge (or a starting paper given to you by your supervisor) everything gets a lot easier. There are a couple of key strategies: Looking at the references of a paper Looking at what else the same author published Looking for similar titles Reading Journals For all three of them, I can highly recommend Google Scholar . They also offer a nice overview / statistics about authors so that you can get a feeling for their scientific activity. But don't let you fool you by those numbers: It is possible to fake them. The other nice thing is that Google Scholar makes citing publications incredibly easy: Searching for a publication on Google Scholar Citing a publication via Google Scholar The arXiv The arXiv can be seen as THE \"modern way\" journal. Depending on the field, it has a VERY high reputation. For Pattern Recognition the reputation of the arXiv is amongst the highest ten journals, but it there are some fields like physics where it is THE top journal in several subfields like cosmology or high energy physics. What makes the arXiv stand out is the fact that you can read new papers every day. I like to have a view at cs.CV/recent to keep myself informed about new stuff. There are about 20 new publications per day. On some days, there is nothing interesting, on other days like today quite a bit: The MegaFace Benchmark: 1 Million Faces for Recognition at Scale Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision Labeling the Features Not the Samples: Efficient Video Classification with Minimal Supervision Attribute2Image: Conditional Image Generation from Visual Attributes Latest submissions on arXiv in Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision Filtering I filter publications like this: First, I look at the title. If that doesn't look interesting, I skip it. The more exact the title is, the better. If it is too vague, I sometimes skip it too because the authors seem not to be familiar with the scientific style of writing and thus are probably not able to write an interesting paper. Then I read the abstract. I expect to get to know what the paper is about. Then I look at images / tables (depending on the subject) I read the conclusion / last part I read the end of the introduction where it often says \"the paper is structured as follows\" I guess many researchers filter like this. This is important to know when you write a paper. Recently, I've also got to know shortscience.org . It's a website where anybody can add summaries / remarks of papers. This is pretty awesome if you want to get the paper in context (especially of work which was released after the paper) or if you just want to see what the key idea behind a paper is. See also Tools for Academia trendingarxiv","tags":"Science","title":"How to find new Papers"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/openbci/","text":"I've just discovered the OpenBCI: Biosensing for Everybody Kickstarter project. BCI is short for Brain Computer Interface. This Kickstarter is about an EEG device. Such a device looks like a helmet. It has several electrodes which you place on your scalp. Those electrodes measure \"voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain\" (source: Wikpedia ). I'm really curious about this, because I recently had some thoughts that medicine is currently not working as I want it to be. Doctors rely on the information they get by their patients, and they shouldn't. Patients can either directly lie or say something which is not try by accident. Instead of taking this feedback from patients, decisions should more often rely on hard data. For locked-in people, that means people who have sever difficulties to communicate with the outside world, it would be awesome if we could use BCIs to help them. I know this is far in the future, but you have to start at some point. Another use I would really be curious is some kind of \"automatic interrogation\". Think of terrorists / criminals who got caught, but are not willing to give the police necessary information. I think we should have the possibility to extract this kind of information from them, without hurting them. This idea was mentioned in one of the books of Daniel Suarez ; I think it was Daemon . The last nice application of BCIs would be REALLY convenient ways to interact with computers. Again, this is something really far in the future, but an awesome idea ☺ The Perks Ganglion It is an EEG board. Whatever that means: The OpenBCI Ganglion is a high-quality, affordable bio-sensing device. On the input side, there are 4 high-impedance differential inputs, a driven ground (DRL), a positive voltage supply (Vdd), and a negative voltage supply (Vss). The inputs can be used as individual differential inputs for measuring EMG or ECG, or they can be individually connected to a reference electrode for measuring EEG. Ultracortex Mark IV The Ultracortex Mark IV is an EEG headset. The Ultracortex Mark III is the latest working version of the OpenBCI headset. You can find all of the 3D files. links to hardware, and an assembly on our Github repo. We designed it for maximum adjustability and ease of use. In our design thinking, we prioritized the use of dry electrodes (pictured in the images above). Using dry sensors significantly reduces the time needed for setup (no more sticky paste!) and makes the overall experience of wearing the headset much more pleasant. There are three options: Print-It-Yourself ($350): this reward comes with all of the pieces required to assemble a full Ultracortex Mark IV aside from the pieces you can print yourself with a desktop 3D-printer, in addition to an OpenBCI Ganglion Board. This kit is perfect for backers who have their own 3D-printer. Unassembled ($450): this reward comes with all of the pieces required to assemble a full Ultracortex Mark IV headset, including the pieces that are 3D-printable, and an OpenBCI Ganglion Board. Fully Assembled ($650): if you select this reward, you will receive a fully- assembled Ultracortex Mark IV with an OpenBCI Ganglion Board. It will arrive ready to plug in and fire up! What I would expect from it to be able to differentiate at least five different kinds of signals which I can willently make. Why five? Up Down Right (Yes) Left (No) Enter With those, you can make a virtual keyboard which is usable. Of course, you can also do so with two actions (next, enter), but that is MUCH more of a pain. The more different signals you can distinguish, the better. I also expect it to be able to see when I feel pain or when I sleep. Specs Currently, there are basically no specs available (see comments ). Some comments seem to suggest that there are only 16 electrodes in use. Then they speak about a 10-20 and a 10-10 system. I have no idea what that means. The People behind it The project is done by Joel Murphy and Conor Russomanno . They seem to have made a similar Kickstarter called \"Spiderclaw\", but I could only find the GitHub repository . They also said they are affiliated with Pulse Sensor In a video, Paul Sajda (PhD, Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology at Columbia University, source ) says it is a \"high quality recording system\". Ashley E. Stewart (CSO of Neuromore , see also brainbodyperformance.com ) Aaron Trocola (Industrial Designer at Threeform ) seems to be the person who designs the 3D printed parts. David Putrino, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Weill Cornell Medical College ( source ) also said a couple of positive words about it. Conclusion By now, this project does not give me the impression that it is ready-to-use. I am still waiting for some feedback, but I guess I will rather wait for other (independant) people writing reviews about it. Preverably mentioning it in scientific papers which get published in notable journals or cited by enough other people.

At least 129 people died and 352 people were injured. The attack happened on the evening of 13 November 2015. 6 mass shootings and 3 suicide bombings happened. What happened and the reactions I've seen so far make this the European / French equivalent of September 11 attacks . A lot of people died or were injured, one of the most important cities were affected, politicians say we are in war, on Facebook people show condolence. Questions we need to ask The Terrorists : Who were the terrorists? What was their story? How did they become terrorists? The Weapons : Where did they get the weapons from? Can we prevent that? Fast reactions : How could the police react that fast? Future : How do we want to deal with such attacks? The Terrorists ISIS claims they were responsible for the attacks. We could stop to think here and many certainly will. It is a terrorist organization and that is what terrorists do. The people were religiously motivated lunatics, so we don't need to understand them. Right? Wrong. People are complicated. They don't always act consistently. Their environment is critical to form who they are. If you grew up in an environment where you didn't have reliable access to clean water, food, medical services, education, work, and a perspective on a good live in general, you would certainly be somebody else. Don't get me wrong here. I don't want to talk it little. Everybody has a choice what he can do in his live. What terrorists do is cruel. But just like after September 11, I am pretty sure we (France, Germany, Europe) will spend a lot of time and money in reaction to the attacks. One reaction we will certainly get is demands for more spendings / actions in military and surveillance. Demands for closing borders. What I want to say is that we are trying to intervene in a too late step of the \"terror process\". People are not born terrorists. They become terrorists during their lives. We should not prevent terrorists from entering our countries, from blowing up what is important for us. We should prevent people from becoming terrorists. Now you might say that is easier said than done. But a very first step would be getting a detailed view of the terrorists lives. I don't mean the preparation, but their complete live. Their environment. And then change that. My assumption is that we could completely prevent generations of terrorists from being born when we \"simply\" make the world better. Weapons According to the Paris prosecutor, the attackers wearing suicide vests used TATP as an explosive. This is easy to make from things of everyday live. So we can't prevent it from being made and used by suicide bombers, except if we massively sacrifice privacy. I'm talking here about cameras in your bedroom kind of surveillance. \"Only\" the US way of surveillance will not change anything. However, I've also read that the terrorists used AK-47 rifles . They cannot be build by yourself, so we should find out where they came from. One only the concrete path, but in general. Fast Reactions It is less than two days after the attacks, and we already know which type of explosive the bombing vests were made of, some people were put into arrest, and we are sure that ISIS is responsible. This is astonishing. It feels as if the police was doing an extraordinary good job here. I wonder if it would be that fast outside of Paris. At the same time, it feels too fast. When we get news that fast, we (unconciously) will expect such fast reactions with other attacks. This might not be possible and people might - too fast - ask for political changes. I just want to point out that such fast reactions and the quick, not very well investigated articles we get today (like this one... but I'm not a journalist) are not always good for us. Possible actions I see three ways we, as a society, can react to terrorist attacks in general: No reaction Surveillance and military Development aid No reaction I was positively surprised how the people from Norway reacted to the 2011 Norway attacks . They didn't start new surveillance programs. They didn't increase their military spendings. The Norwegians showed they are strong. They showed the world that they are united. They showed that they will not let terrorist attacks change the way they live their lives. Surveillance and military When something happens, people want politicians to show they improve the situation. They want revenge. They want others to share their pain. They feel insecure and want to feel strong and secure again. This is a reason why spending more money in surveillance and military is a very understandable, logical reaction. But be clear what you're doing when you ask for more spendings in military and surveillance. Be clear what you sacrifice when you want to expand the power of intelligence services. Think about how you let terrorists change your live. Which other dangers you might put your society into. I am a strong opponent of surveillance and also (not that much, but still) an opponent of military. One reason is that we are playing a stupid game (see A Waste of Money and Time , a security expert). We see what terrorists did, like an attack with airplanes, and we as a society spend lots and lots of effort to prevent that. We accept being treated like criminals, hundred thousands of passengers, just to get a slight chance to catch a terrorist. The terrorists know that, so they can take the train and do exactly the same. We pick our defenses and they do something different. I don't want to play such a stupid game. One way around is intelligence. But the bad thing is, that it doesn't make sense to use a little bit of intelligence. You have to go the full, Orwellian way to have a good chance of it being effective. Here is what I could think of: Make money flows transparent: Don't use cash any more. Only digital money which gets tracked by government agencies. Track who buys what in which quantities. Make shops, no matter how small, connect the transactions with goods you bought. This has to include everything, as you can use quite a lot of different things to build bombs. Track everybody: With smartphones you can make detailed movement profiles. Even if you're not on Facebook, you can build a social graph. Who talked to whom, who has how much contact to whom. Who is influential, who isn't. Get rid of privacy: We have surveillance equipment everywhere. Private smartphones, tablets, laptops usually have cameras and microphones. Most people use these devices to communicate. These devices, combined with traffic cameras, private shop / bank cameras give pretty detailed images of what is going on. An automatic computer system like Microsoft's Domain Awareness System could constantly take this information and react within seconds. But we have to be aware of what we sacrifice when we are doing it. The surveillance systems can be hacked. They can be misused. The automatic algorithms can - just like humans - make mistakes. Imagine the world we would live in if the Gestapo or the Stasi had access to this kind of technology. Imagine how people would act differently when they know everything they did was recorded and could be hold against them later. On the positive side: This could decrease \"normal\" crime, too. Development aid Just as I began to write before, I would prefer if we spend more money on development aid. I am pretty sure there are many (potential) terrorists, which would not even consider that if they were in a better situation. We could massively improve the situation of the live of millions of people. Even if it would not work against terrorism, we would still do something inherently good. We would help the people. If we honestly want to improve their situation, if we don't use military but humanitarian aid, people will recognize this. People will have something good in their minds when they thought of us (see \"Brot statt Bomben\" ). A positive side-effect would be that it would stop coming more refugees to Europe. Of course, just throwing money at the problem will not solve anything. We need to check if the money actually gets to the people. We need to check if it improves their lives. We need them to get in a situation where they are able to choose what to do with their lives. Not from equally bad situations, but giving people the possibility to make their live become good. We need to understand the problems of those countries. We have to work with the people there, not work for them. We have to support, not to lead. There are certainly a lot of organizations like Engineers Without Borders and Doctors Without Borders which have a very good idea what has to be done in a short-term perspective to improve the lives of many people. However, we should plan for a long-term perspective. We should get in contact with refugees who are willing to get back if the situation was better and try to figure out what they need to improve the situation. And we should finally stand to our word and reach the Millennium Development Goals I can't find the source, but the costs for reaching the MDGs were lower than I expected. Especially access to clean water significantly lower than 20 Billion US-Dollar, if I remember it correctly. The GDP of Europe is about 18,527,116 Million US-Dollar. That means we would have to spend about 0.1 % of our GDP for this goal. Now think of the money that was spend in the European debt crisis . It is hard to put numbers on here, but it was much more than 18 Billion US-Dollar. Hypocracy A fellow student recently pointed out that there were also 2015 Beirut bombings . I didn't even see that in the news. A lot of people die preventable deaths due to the lack of access to clean water, sanitation and food. And we don't even talk about the MDGs. Not really. Some final words One main point of this mini-article is that I am pretty sure people will react to fast. No matter what we do, we should think about it thoroughly. This article is - like hundreds of blog articles, quite a bit of \"professional\" journalist articles and surely some statements by politicians - not well investigated. It is only a quick, spontaneous reaction. The other important point is that we have alternatives to more military and surveillance spendings. We should really think about that. We should talk about it and evaluate it. Finally, it the question is: In which kind of society do we want to live? Edit: The reaction Now it seems to be clear how most politicians react: Frankreichs Premier Valls: IS greift auch andere europäische Länder an Französisches Militär bombardiert IS-Stellungen in Syrien Sicherheitsmaßnahmen in Deutschland deutlich verschärft See also Du bist Terrorist : A clip by a German satire show.

They published it under Apache License 2.0 . Looking at the source code overview, it seems to be mainly C++ with a significant bit of Python. I guess the abstract of the Whitepaper is a good description what TensorFlow is: TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org. The core seems to be written in C++, but it has a Python front end. By now, I couldn't test much because I just made my GPU machine unusable (while trying to get the GPU General Computing practical software to run...). I'll try to expand this article as soon as possible, but I guess it might take several weeks until I have enough time. Lets see... Installation The documentation about the installation makes a VERY good impression. Better than anything I can write in a few minutes, so ... RTFM 😜 For Linux systems with CUDA and without root privileges, you can install it with: $ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl --user But remember you have to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CUDA_HOME . For many configurations, adding the following lines to your .bashrc will work: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = \" $LD_LIBRARY_PATH :/usr/local/cuda/lib64\" export CUDA_HOME = /usr/local/cuda MNIST The following code can be used to check if your Tensor Flow installation is working. You have to have the get_mnist_data_tf.py in the same directory as the following script. I've - more or less - directly copied it from the tutorial . Just execute the script below and see if it finishes without throwing errors. #!/usr/bin/env python from get_mnist_data_tf import read_data_sets mnist = read_data_sets ( \"MNIST_data/\" , one_hot = True ) import tensorflow as tf sess = tf .

Let's begin with the nice parts: Tensor Flow has a usable documentation (e.g. The neural network part ). Not great, as Lasagne where you have lots of details (e.g. activation functions ) Seems to be quite easy to use. Seems to be well-tested by simply being used in many different projects by Google. Just like Theano (and thus Lasagne), Tensor flow has automatic differenciation. Not sure: How easy is it to share trained models? In which format would you do so? How easy is it to understand a shared model? How easy is it to get something new to Tensor Flow like recurrent layers? (Actually, this seems rather to show that either the Whitepaper is a bit misleading or the documentation / Google search is not that good. In the whitepaper they write something about LTSM models, but I couldn't find any docs about that. Only by manually going through the manual, I found it ) Not so nice: Doesn't work with Python 3. They don't follow PEP8 . I know that there is a Python style guide by Google , but it does not seem to follow that one either. See the next section for some more detailed feedback. Just like the other Toolkits, you need CUDA. It doesn't work with OpenCL. PEP8 Whitespace W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10])) should be W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10])) . Missing whitespaces happened quite often. Indent with 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces. The Google guide seems also to use 4. Newlines between functions are missing. Print statement instead of a print function was used &rightarrow; only Python 2, not Python 3. I'm not sure why y_ has the trailing underscore. According to PEP8 , a single trailing underscore is used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword. A mixture of different styles as pointed out on Credric's Blog Videos Starting at 21m 2s: Alternatives / Similar software As I don't really know by now what Tensor Flow is doing, I can't pin-point alternatives. But I have some educated guesses: Theano has been around for quite a while and seems to have a similar approach with its computational graph. Enhanced by Lasagne , it is a pretty good alternative when it comes to neural networks. Lasagne has an exceptionally good documentation, but parts of the tutorial could still be improved. Caffe was something I recently tried. I didn't like it too much due to the lack of documentation, but it certainly is a big project. Especially when it comes to images. I haven't tried, but they look promising: Chainer MXNet CGT Torch has a very nice example for a character predictor .

Deduktion Die Deduktion ist eine Schlussfolgerung von gegebenen Prämissen auf die logisch zwingenden Konsequenzen. Deduktion ist schon bei Aristoteles als „Schluss vom Allgemeinen auf das Besondere\" verstanden worden. Modus ponens Der Modus ponens ist eine Art des logischen Schließens. Er besagt: Wenn die Prämissen $A \\rightarrow B$ und $A$ gelten, dann gilt auch $B$.

Induktives Lernen Slide name: MLI_02_InduktivesLernen_slides1.pdf Version Space Der Raum aller Hypotesen, welche mit den Trainingsbeispielen konsistent sind. Version Space Algorithmus Der Version Space Algorithmus ist ein binärer Klassifikator für diskrete Feature-Spaces. Er startet mit der generellsten Hypothese $G = (?, \\dots, ?)$ - alles ist wahr - und der speziellsten Hypothese $S = (\\#, \\dots, \\#)$ - nichts ist wahr. Wenn ein Beispiel mit dem Label true gesehen wird, dann wird die speziellste Hypothese angepasst und veralgemeinert. Wenn ein Beispiel mit dem Label false gesehen wird, wird die generellste Hypothese spezialisiert. So kann man den Raum aller mit den Trainingsdaten konsistenten Hypothesen finden. Konzept Ein Konzept beschreibt eine Untermenge von Objekten oder Ereignissen definiert auf einer größerer Menge. Konsistenz Keine negativen Beispiele werden positiv klassifiziert.

University of California, Berkeley. This expalins TD-learning. What is the Q function and what is the V function in reinforcement learning? Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning Markovsches Entscheidungsproblem ( Markov Decision Process , MDP ) Ein Markovsches Entscheidungsproblem ist ein 5-Tupel $(S, A, P, R, p_0)$, wobei $S$ eine endliche Zustandsmenge (states), $A(s)$ eine Menge von möglichen Aktionen im Zustand $s$, $P(s, s', a) = P(s_{t+1} = s' | s_t = s, a_t = a)$: Die Wahrscheinlichkeit im Zeitschritt $t+1$ im Zustand $s'$ zu sein, wenn man zum Zeitpunkt $t$ im Zustand $s$ ist und die Aktion $a$ ausführt $R(s, s', a) \\in \\mathbb{R}$: Die direkte Belohnung, wenn durch die Aktion $a$ vom Zustand $s$ in den Zustand $s'$ gekommen ist. $p_0$ ist die Startverteilung auf die Zustände $S$ Manchmal wird auch der Diskontierungsfaktor $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$, welche die Bedeutung von direkten Belohnungen im Vergleich zu künftigen Belohnungen anzeigt, hier schon genannt. Allerdings finde ich das an dieser Stelle eher unpassend, da $\\gamma$ eher verwendet wird um die Lösung in der Praxis bestimmen zu können. Mit dem Problem hat $\\gamma$ an sich nichts zu tun. Reinforcement Learning ( RL , Bestärkendes Lernen ) Beim bestärkenden Lernen liegt ein Markow-Entscheidungsproblemen vor. Es gibt also einen Agenten, der Aktionen ausführen kann. Diese können (nicht notwendigerweise sofort) bewertet werden. Policy ( Strategie ) Siehe Probabilistische Planung . Policy Learning Unter Policy Learning versteht man die Suche nach einer optimalen Strategie $\\pi&#94;*$. V-Funktion ( Value function , State-Value function ) Die Funktion $V&#94;\\pi: S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ heißt Value-Funktion. Sie gibt den erwarteten Wert (nicht die Belohnung, da bei der V-Funktion noch der Diskontierungsfaktor eingeht!) eines Zustands $s$ unter der Strategie $\\pi$ an. Mit $V&#94;*$ wird der Wert unter der optimalen Strategie bezeichnet. Q-Funktion ( Action-Value function , Quality function ) Siehe Probabilistische Planung . Eligibility Traces Siehe Probabilistische Planung . Beispiel für RL: Roboter muss zu einem Ziel navigieren Algorithmen: Simple Value Iteration Simple Value Iteration estimates the value function by updating it as long as necessary to converge: $$\\hat{V}&#94;*(s_t) \\leftarrow r_t + \\gamma \\hat{V}&#94;*(s_{t+1})$$ \"Simple\" means that the transition function is deterministic. It is explained in Sebastian Thrun: Unit 9 17 Value Iteration 1 on YouTube. Sebastian Thrun: Unit 9 17 Value Iteration 2 on YouTube. Sebastian Thrun: Unit 9 17 Value Iteration 3 on YouTube. Simple Temporal Difference Learning Simple Temporal Difference Learning is just like Simple Value Iteration, but now the Value function is updated with a learning rate $\\alpha$: $$\\hat{V}&#94;*(s_t) \\leftarrow (1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\hat{V}&#94;*(s_t) + \\alpha(r_t + \\gamma \\hat{V}&#94;*(s_{t+1}))$$ Mehr dazu im nächsten Abschnitt .

Barto: Temporal-Difference Learning . 1998. Der TD-Learning Algorithmus beschäftigt sich mit dem Schätzen der Value-Funktion \\(V&#94;\\pi\\) für eine gegebene Strategie \\(\\pi\\) . Das wird auch policy evaluation oder prediction genannt. TD-Learning (Temporal Difference Learning) Siehe auch Optimalitätsprinzip von Bellman Guest Post (Part I): Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning Lerntheorie Slide name: MLI_04_Lerntheorie_slides1.pdf Ockhams Rasiermesser (Quelle: Wikipedia ) Von mehreren möglichen Erklärungen für ein und denselben Sachverhalt ist die einfachste Theorie allen anderen vorzuziehen. Eine Theorie ist einfach, wenn sie möglichst wenige Variablen und Hypothesen enthält, und wenn diese in klaren logischen Beziehungen zueinander stehen, aus denen der zu erklärende Sachverhalt logisch folgt. Overfitting Zu starke Anpassung des Klassifizierers an die Lerndaten; geringe Generalisierungsfähgikeit Structural Risc Minimization ( SRM ) Unter Structural risk minimization versteht man die Abwägung zwischen einem einfachen Modell und einem komplexen Modell, welches auf den Trainingsdaten besser funktioniert aber eventuell mehr unter Overfitting leidet. Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension ( VC-Dimension ) Die VC -Dimension $VC(H, X) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\infty$ eines Hypothesenraumes $H$ ist gleich der maximalen Anzahl an Datenpunkten aus $X$, die von $H$ beliebig in zwei Mengen gespalten werden können. Dabei muss es nur eine Teilmenge $X' \\subseteq X $ der Größe $n$ geben, damit $VC(H, X) \\geq n$ gilt. Falls beliebige Teilmengen von $X$ durch $H$ separiert werden können, so gilt $VC(H, X) = \\infty$. Praktisch gesehen ist $X$, die Menge aller möglichen Features, sowie $H$, die Menge aller möglichen Trennlinien im Feature-Space, vorgegeben. Die Frage ist ob man eine Teilmenge $X' \\subseteq X$ findet mit $|X'| = n$, sodass man für $X'$ jede Mögliche Teilung in zwei Mengen durch $H$ realisieren kann. Probably approximately correct learning ( PAC ) PAC macht eine Aussage über die Anzahl der benötigten Stichproben, wenn man einen bestimmten realen Fehler mit einer frei zu wählenden Wahrscheinlichkeit bekommen will. Lernmaschine wird definiert durch Hypothesenraum \\(\\{h_\\alpha: \\alpha \\in A\\}\\) und Lernverfahren. Das Lernverfahren ist die Methode um \\(\\alpha_{\\text{opt}}\\) mit Hilfe von Lernbeispielen zu finden. Probleme beim Lernen: Größe des Hypothesenraums im Vergleich zur Anzahl der Trainingsdaten. Das Verfahren könnte nur suboptimale Lösungen finden. Das Verfahren könnte die passende Hypothese nicht beinhalten. Lernproblemtypen: Sei die Menge der Lernbeispiele in \\(X \\times Y\\) , mit \\(X \\times Y =\\) ... \\(\\{Attribut_1, Attribut_2, ...\\} \\times \\{True, False\\}\\) : Konzeptlernen \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\times \\{Klasse_1, ..., Klasse_n\\}\\) : Klassifikation \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) : Regression Gradientenabstieg, Overfitting Kreuzvalidierung PAC Folie 35: Was ist eine Instanz der Länge \\(n\\) ?

Bagging ( Bootstrap aggregating ) Kombiniere mehrere schwache Modelle um ein gutes zu bekommen. Dabei bekommt jedes schwache Modell nur eine Teilmenge aller Trainingsdaten.

Folie 22: Wofür steht \\(i\\) und welchen Wertebereich hat \\(i\\) ? → \\(i\\) ist eine Zählvariable, welche die Trainingsdaten durchnummeriert. Stellt \\(W_k(i)\\) die Wahrscheinlichkeit dar, dass Beispiel \\(i\\) im \\(k\\) -ten Durchlauf für das Training verwendet wird? → Nein. \\(W_k(i)\\) ist das Gewicht des \\(i\\) -ten Trainingsbeispiels für den \\(k\\) -ten klassifikator. Siehe Folie 24 und folgende für ein Beispiel. Siehe auch: Alexander Ihler: AdaBoost .

VC-Dimension VC-Dimension , siehe YouTube und [ Mit97 ] Sei $H&#94;\\alpha = \\{h_\\alpha : \\alpha \\in A\\}$ der Hypothesenraum. Die VC-Dimension $VC(h_\\alpha)$ von $H&#94;\\alpha$ ist gleich der maximalen Anzahl von beliebig platzierten Datenpunkten, die von $H&#94;\\alpha$ separiert werden können. Folie 44: \\(\\eta \\in [0, 1]\\) ist ein Parameter, der beliebig gewählt werden kann. Siehe Info-Box Abschätzung des realen Fehlers .

Perzeptron von Rosenblatt (1960) Auswertung: Input-Vektor und Bias mit Gewichten multiplizieren, addieren und Aktivierungsfunktion anwenden. Training: Zufällige Initialisierung des Gewichtsvektors, addieren von fehlklassifizierten Vektoren auf Gewichtsvektor. Gradientenabstieg Software: Lasagne : Python, hat eine exzellente Dokumentation, die auch größtenteils auf explizit auf Literatur verweist und die Formeln hinter den Funktionen direkt angibt. Google TensorFlow Cascade Correlation (siehe Fahlman und Lebiere: The Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture ) Cascade Correlation ist ein konstruktiver Algorithmus zum erzeugen von Feed-Forward Neuronalen Netzen. Diese haben eine andere Architektur als typische multilayer Perceptrons. Bei Netzen, welche durch Cascade Correlation aufgebaut werden, ist jede Hidden Unit mit den Input-Neuronen verbunden, mit den Output-Neuronen und mit allen Hidden Units in der Schicht zuvor. Siehe YouTube (4:05 min) und How exactly does adding a new unit work in Cascade Correlation? RPROP (siehe YouTube - 15:00min) Rprop ist eine Gewichtsupdate-Regel für neuronale Netze. Sie betrachtet nur das Vorzeichen des Gradienten, jedoch nicht den Betrag. Jedes Gewicht wird unabhängig von den anderen behandelt. Der Algorithmus hat Konstanten $\\eta&#94;- \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\le 1}$ sowie $\\eta&#94;+ \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 1}$. Für jedes Gewicht ist außerdem $\\eta=1$ zu Beginn. Bei jedem Gewichtsupdate wird überprüft, ob sich das Vorzeichen des Gradienten für dieses Gewicht geändert hat. Falls ja, wird das Gewicht um $\\eta \\cdot \\eta&#94;+$ bzw $\\eta \\cdot \\eta&#94;-$ geändert. Außerdem kann eine minimale bzw. eine Maximale Änderung gesetzt werden. Delta-Regel , siehe neuronalesnetz.de Die Delta-Regel ist ein Lernalgorithmus für neuronale Netze mit nur einer Schicht. Sie ist ein Spezialfall des algemeineren Backpropagation-Algorithmus und lautet wie folgt: $$\\Delta w_{ji} = \\alpha (t_j - y_j) \\varphi'(h_j) x_i$$ wobei $\\Delta w_{ji} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ die Änderung des Gewichts von Input $i$ zum Neuron $j$, $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ die Lernrate (typischerweise $\\alpha \\approx 0.1$), $t_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ der Zielwert des Neurons $j$, $y_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ die tatsächliche Ausgabe, $\\varphi'$ die Ableitung der Aktivierungsfunktion des Neurons, $h_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$ die gewichtete Summe der Eingaben des Neurons und $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ der $i$-te Input ist. Gradient-Descent Algorithmus Der Gradient-Descent Algorithmus ist ein Optimierungsalgorithmus für differenzierbare Funktionen. Er startet an einer zufälligen Stelle $x_0$. Dann wird folgender Schritt mehrfach ausgeführt: $$x_0 \\gets x_0 - \\alpha \\cdot \\text(grad) f (x_0)$$ wobei $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$ die Lernrate ist und $f$ die zu optimierende Funktion. Dabei könnte $\\alpha$ mit der Zeit auch kleiner gemacht werden. Backpropagation (siehe neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com ) Der Backpropagation-Algorithmus ist eine Variante des Gradient-Descent Algorithmus, welche für MLPs angepasst wurde. Sie besteht aus drei Schritten: Forward-Pass : Lege die Input-Features an das Netz an und erhalte den Output Fehlerberechnung : Mache das für alle Daten Backward-Pass : Passe die Gewichte Im Grunde ist Backpropagation nur eine Geschwindigkeitsoptimierte Variante des Gradient-Descent Algorithmus, da die Gradienten im Backpropagation-Algorithmus auf geschickte Weise berechnet werden. Radiale Basisfunktion ( Radial Basis Function , RBF ) Eine radiale Basisfunktion ist eine Funktion $f: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, für die $f(x) = f(\\|x\\|)$ gilt bzw. allgemeiner, für die ein $c \\in D$ existiert, sodass $f(x, c) = f(\\|x - c\\|)$ gilt. Der Wert der Funktion hängt also nur von der Distanz zum Ursprung bzw. allgemeiner zu einem Punkt $c \\in D$ ab. Ein typisches Beispiel sind gaußsche RBFs: $f(x) = e&#94;{-(a (x - c)&#94;2)}$, wobei $a, c$ Konstanten sind. Radial-Basis Funktion Netz ( RBF-Netz ) Ein Radial-Basis Funktion Netz ist eine neuronales Netz, welches als Aktivierungsfunktionen RBFs verwendet. Dabei gibt es dann für jedes Neuron im Grunde zwei Parameter: Der Radius und das Zentrum (vgl. Folie 39 für die Gewichtsanpassung). Dynamic Decay Adjustment ( DDA ) DDA ist ein konstruktiver Lernalgorithmus für RBF-Netze welcher in [ Ber95 ] vorgestellt wird. Bei den Netzwerken, die DDA annimmt, gibt es sog. Prototypen . Das scheinen einfach Neuronen mit RBF-Aktivierungsfunktionen zu sein, welche für eine Klasse stehen. Zwei Schwellwerte, $\\theta&#94;+$ und $\\theta&#94;-$, werden eingeführt. Der Schwellwert $\\theta&#94;+$ muss beim Training eines Beispiels der Klasse $y_1$ von einem Neuron der Klasse $y_1$ überschritten werden. Falls das nicht der Fall ist, wird ein neues Neuron hinzugefügt. Der Schwellwert $\\theta&#94;-$ ist eine obere Grenze für die Aktivierung von Neuronen, die zu anderen Klassen gehören. Ist eine Aktivierung höher, wird der Radius des zugehörigen Neurons verringert. $\\theta&#94;+ = 0.4$ und $\\theta&#94;- = 0.2$ sind sinnvolle Werte. Laut einem Prüfungsprotokoll lernt DDA nach Vapnik korrekt. Siehe auch: The Dynamic Decay Adjustment Algorithm Siehe auch Neuronale Netze - Vorlesung What are prototypes in RBF networks? Instanzbasiertes Lernen Slide name: MLI_06_InstanzbasiertesLernen_slides1.pdf Instanzenbasiertes Lernen bzw. Lazy Learning Instanzenbasiertes Lernen ist ein Lernverfahren, welches einfach nur die Beispiele abspeichert, also faul (engl. lazy) ist. Soll der Lerner neue Daten klassifizieren, so wird die Klasse des ähnlichsten Datensatzes gewählt. Case-based Reasoning bzw. kurz CBR CBR ist ein allgemeines, abstraktes Framework und kein direkt anwendbarer Algorithmus. Die Idee ist, dass nach ähnlichen, bekannten Fällen gesucht wird, auf die der aktuelle Fall übertragen werden kann. Fall im Kontext des CBR Ein Fall ist eine Abstraktion eines Ereignisses, die in Zeit und Raum begrenzt ist. Ein Fall enthält eine Problembeschreibung, eine Lösung und ein Ergebnis. Zusätzlich kann ein Fall eine Erklärung enthalten warum das Ergebnis auftrat, Informationen über die Lösungsmethode, Verweise auf andere Fälle oder Güteinformationen enthalten. Beispiel für Lazy Learning: \\(k\\) -NN , CBR NODO: Folie 3: „Fleißige\" Lernalgorithmen mit dem gleichen Hypothesenraum sind eingeschränkter - was ist damit gemeint? Was sind fleißige Lernalgorithmen? Lernalgorithmen, welche den meisten Rechenaufwand beim Lernen investieren, wo aber das auswerten vergleichsweise billig ist? SVM Slide name: MLI_07_SVM_slides1.pdf Eine Erklärung von SVMs findet sich im Artikel Using SVMs with sklearn . SVMs sind laut Vapnik die Lernmaschine mit der kleinsten möglichen VC- Dimension, falls die Klassen linear trennbar sind. Primäres Optimierungsproblem: Finde einen Sattelpunkt der Funktion \\(L_P = L(\\vec{w}, b, \\vec{\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\vec{w}\\|&#94;2 - \\sum_{i=1}&#94;N \\alpha_i (y_i(\\vec{w}\\vec{x_i}+b)-1)\\) wobei \\(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_N \\geq 0\\) Lagrange-Multiplikatoren sind Soft Margin Hyperebene Der Parameter \\(C\\) dient der Regularisierung. Ist \\(C\\) groß gibt es wenige Missklassifikationen in der Trainingsdatenmenge. Ist \\(C\\) klein, werden die Margins größer. Nichtlineare Kernelmethoden Kernel-Trick Abschätzung des realen Fehlers Der reale Fehler kann durch den empirischen Fehler und die VC-Dimension wie folgt abgeschätzt werden: Mit Wahrscheinlichkeit $P(1-\\eta)$ gilt: $$E(h_\\alpha) \\leq E_{emp}(h_\\alpha) + \\sqrt{\\frac{VC(h_\\alpha)}{N} \\cdot (\\log(2 N / VC(h_\\alpha)) + 1) - \\frac{\\log(\\eta / 4)}{N}}$$ wobei gilt: $E(h_\\alpha)$ ist der reale Fehler der mit der Hypothese $h_\\alpha$ gemacht wird $E_{emp}(h_\\alpha)$ ist der empirische Fehler der mit der Hypothese $h_\\alpha$ gemacht wird $VC(h_\\alpha)$ ist die VC-Dimension der Lernmaschine $N$ ist die Anzahl der Lernbeispiele $0 \\leq \\eta \\leq 1$ Dieser Term wird in der Structural Risc Minimization minimiert. Entscheidungsbäume Slide name: MLI_08_Entscheidungsbaeume_slides1.pdf Entscheidungsbaum ( Decision Tree ) Ein Entscheidungsbaum ist ein Klassifikator in Baumstruktur. Die inneren Knoten des Entscheidungsbaumes sind Attributtests, die Blätter sind Klassen. Typischerweise wird ein Entscheidungsbaum aufgebaut, indem das jeweilige Attribut mit dem höchsten Information Gain als nächster Knoten hinzugefügt wird. Siehe Information gain in decision trees für weitere Informationen. ID3 (siehe pseudocode ) ID3 ist ein Top-Bottom Verfahren zum Aufbau eines Entscheidungsbaumes. C4.5 (siehe pseudocode ) ID3 ist ein Top-Bottom Verfahren zum Aufbau eines Entscheidungsbaumes, welches auf ID3 basiert. Random Forest , Quelle: Wikipedia Ein Random Forest ist ein Klassifikationsverfahren, welches aus mehreren verschiedenen, unkorrelierten Entscheidungsbäumen besteht. Alle Entscheidungsbäume sind unter einer bestimmten Art von Randomisierung während des Lernprozesses gewachsen. Für eine Klassifikation darf jeder Baum in diesem Wald eine Entscheidung treffen und die Klasse mit den meisten Stimmen entscheidet die endgültige Klassifikation. Der Algorithmus ID5R dienen dem Aufbau eines Entscheidungsbaumes. C4.5 unterstützt - im Gegensatz zu ID3 - kontinuierliche Attributwerte. Außerdem kann C4.5 mit fehlenden Attributwerten umgehen. Mögliches Qualtitätsmaß ist Entropie: \\(Entropie(S) = - p_\\oplus \\log_2 p_\\oplus - p_\\ominus \\log_2 p_\\ominus\\) wobei \\(\\oplus\\) die positiven Beispiele und \\(\\ominus\\) die negativen Beispiele bezeichnet. Folie 41: Wo ist der Vorteil von ID5R im Vergleich zu ID3, wenn das Ergebnis äquivalent ist? → ID5R kann inkrementell verwendet werden. Es ist bei ID5R - im Gegensatz zu ID3 - also nicht nötig bei neuen Trainingsdaten neu zu trainieren. Random Forest: Erstelle mehrere Entscheidungsbäume mit einer zufälligen Wahl an Attributen. Jeder Baum stimmt für eine Klasse und die Klasse, für die die meisten Stimmen, wird gewählt. Bayes Lernen Slide name: MLI_09_BayesLernen_slides1.pdf Siehe auch: Dynamische Bayesssche Netze in ML2 Satz von Bayes Seien $A, B$ Ereignisse, $P(B) > 0$. Dann gilt: $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$ Dabei wird $P(A)$ a priori Wahrscheinlichkeit, $P(B|A)$ likelihood, und $P(A|B)$ a posteriori Wahrscheinlichkeit genannt. Naiver Bayes-Klassifikator Ein Klassifizierer heißt naiver Bayes-Klassifikator, wenn er den Satz von Bayes unter der naiven Annahme der Unabhängigkeit der Features benutzt. Produktregel $P(A \\land B) = P(A|B) \\cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)$ Summenregel $P(A \\lor B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\land P)$ Theorem der totalen Wahrscheinlichkeit Es seien $A_1, \\dots, A_n$ Ereignisse mit $i \\neq j \\Rightarrow A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset \\;\\;\\;\\forall i, j \\in 1, \\dots, n$ und $\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n A_i = 1$. Dann gilt: $P(B) = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n P(B|A_i) P(A_i)$ Maximum A Posteriori Hypothese (MAP-Hypothese) Sei $H$ der Raum aller Hypothesen und $D$ die Menge der beobachteten Daten. Dann heißt $h_{MAP} = \\text{arg max}_{h \\in H} P(h|D) \\cdot P(h)$ die Menge der Maximum A Posteriori Hypothesen. Maximum Likelihood Hypothese (ML-Hypothese) Sei $H$ der Raum aller Hypothesen und $D$ die Menge der beobachteten Daten. Dann heißt $h_{ML} = \\text{arg max}_{h \\in H} P(h|D)$ die Menge der Maximum Likelihood Hypothesen. Normalverteilung Eine stetige Zufallsvariable $X$ mit der Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichte $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, gegeben durch $f(x) = \\frac {1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e&#94;{-\\frac {1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)&#94;2}$ heißt $\\mathcal N\\left(\\mu, \\sigma&#94;2\\right)$-verteilt, normalverteilt mit den Erwartungswert $\\mu$ und Varianz $\\sigma&#94;2$. Prinzip der minimalen Beschreibungslänge Das Prinzip der minimalen Beschreibungslänge ist eine formale Beschreibung von Ockhams Rasiermesser. Nach diesem Prinzip werden Hypothesen bevorzugt, die zur besten Kompression gegebener Daten führen. Gibbs-Algorithmus ( stats.stackexchange ) Der Algorithmus von Gibbs ist eine Methode um Stichproben von bedingten Verteilungen zu erzeugen. Bedingte Unabhängigkeit Seien $X, Y, Z$ Zufallsvariablen. Dann heißt $X$ bedingt unabhängig von $Y$ gegeben $Z$, wenn $$P(X|Y,Z) = P(X|Z)$$ gilt. Add $k$ smoothing Unter Add-$k$-smoothing versteht man eine Technik, durch die sichergestellt wird, dass die geschätzte Wahrscheinlichkeit für kein Ereignis gleich null ist. Wenn man $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ mögliche Ergebnisse eines Experiments hat, $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ experimente durchgeführt werden, dann schätzt man die Wahrscheinlichkeit von dem Ergebnis $i$ mit $$\\hat{\\theta_i} = \\frac{x_i + k}{N+ kd}, $$ wobei $x_i$ die Anzahl der Beobachtungen von $i$ ist und $k \\geq 0$ der Glättungsparameter ist. Bayessches Netz (Quelle: [ Dar09 ]) Ein bayessches Netz ist ein Tupel $(G, \\Theta)$ mit: $G = (\\mathbf{X}, E)$ ist ein DAG der Struktur des Bayesschen Netzwerks genant wird. Dabei ist $\\mathbf{X} = \\{X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\}$ die Menge der Knoten. Jeder Knoten entspricht einer Zufallsvariablen (z.B. Attribut). Existiert eine gerichtete Kante $(X_i, X_j) \\in E$, so existiert eine direkte Abhängigkeit zwischen $X_i$ und $X_j$. $\\Theta$ ist die Menge der bedingten Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen und heißt Parametrisierung des bayesschen Netzwerks. Es existiert für jedes $X_i$ genau eine Verteilung in $\\Theta$, welche in Abhängigkeit der Elternknoten beschrieben wird. In einem bayesschem Netz berechnet sich die gemeinsame Verteilung wie folgt: $$P(X_1, \\dots, X_N) = \\prod_{i=1}&#94;N P(X_i | \\text{Eltern}(X_i))$$ Die Modelierung von Bayesschen Netzen erfolgt meist durch den Menschen mit Expertenwissen. Alternativ kann die Struktur durch MCMC bestimmt werden. Sobald die Struktur gegeben ist wird die Menge der Verteilungen $\\Theta$ durch den Expectation Maximization Algorithmus bestimmt. Fragen: Folie 23: Warum ist \\(h_{MAP(x)}\\) nicht die wahrscheinlichste Klassifikation? Folie 24: Was ist \\(V\\) ? Is there any domain where Bayesian Networks outperform neural networks? HMM Slide name: MLI_10_HMM_slides1.pdf Markov-Bedingung (Beschränkter Horizont) $P(q_{t+1}=S_{t+1}|q_t = S_t, q_{t-1} = S_{t-1}, \\dots) = P(q_{t+1}=S_{t+1}|q_t = S_t)$ Hidden Markov Modell ( HMM ) Eine HMM ist ein Tupel $\\lambda = (S, V, A, B, \\Pi)$: $S = \\{S_1, \\dots, S_n\\}$: Menge der Zustände $V = \\{v_1, \\dots, v_m\\}$: Menge der Ausgabezeichen $A \\in [0,1]&#94;{n \\times n}$ = (a_{ij}): Übergangsmatrix, die die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Zustand $i$ in Zustand $j$ zu kommen beinhaltet $B = (b_{ik})$ die Emissionswahrscheinlichkeit $v_k$ im Zustand $S_i$ zu beobachten $\\Pi = (\\pi_i) = P(q_1 = i)$: Die Startverteilung, wobei $q_t$ den Zustand zum Zeitpunkt $t$ bezeichnet Vorwärts-Algorithmus Der Vorwärts-Algorithmus löst das Evaluierungsproblem. Er benutzt dazu dynamische Programmierung: Die Variablen $\\alpha_t(i) = P(o_1 o_2 \\dots o_t; q_t = s_i | \\lambda)$ gibt die Wahrscheinlichkeit an zum Zeitpunkt $t \\in 1 \\leq t \\leq T$ im Zustand $s_i \\in S$ zu sein und die Sequenz $o_1 o_2 \\dots o_t$ beobachtet zu haben. Diese werden rekursiv berechnet. Dabei beginnt man mit Zeitpunkt $t=1$, berechnet die Wahrscheinlichkeit $o_1$ beobachtet zu haben für jeden Zustand. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit der beobachteten Sequenz, gegeben die HMM $\\lambda$, ist dann einfach die Summe der $\\alpha_i$ des letzten Zeitschritts. Rückwärts-Algorithmus Der Rückwärts-Algorithmus löst das Dekodierungsproblem. Er benutzt dazu dynamische Programmierung: Die Variablen $\\beta_t(i) = P(o_{t+1} o_{t+2} \\dots o_{T}|q_t = s_i, \\lambda)$ geben die Wahrscheinlichkeit an, dass die Sequenz $o_{t+1} o_{t+2} \\dots o_{T}$ beobachtet werden wird, gegeben das HMM $\\lambda$ und den Startzustand $s_i$. Forward-Backward Algorithm Der Forward-Backward Algorithmus berechnet für jeden Zeitpunkt die Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung der Zustände. Dafür glättet er die Werte des Vorwärts- und des Rückwärts-Algorithmus: $$\\gamma_t(i) = \\frac{\\alpha_t(i) \\beta_t(i)}{P(O|\\lambda)}$$ Er findet jedoch nicht die wahrscheinlichste Zustandssequenz. Viterbi-Algorithmus Löst P2: Siehe How to apply the Viterbi algorithm Baum-Welch-Algorithmus Löst P3: Gegeben sei eine Trainingssequenz $O_{\\text{train}}$ und ein Modell $$\\lambda = \\{S, V, A, B, \\Pi\\}$$ Gesucht ist ein Modell $$\\bar \\lambda = \\text{arg max}_{\\bar \\lambda = \\{S, V, \\bar A, \\bar B, \\bar Pi\\}} P(O_{\\text{train}}|\\lambda)$$ Der Baum-Welch-Algorithmus geht wie folgt vor: Bestimme $P(O_{\\text{train}} | \\lambda)$ Schätze ein besseres Modell $\\bar \\lambda$: TODO - Genauer! (Folie 31 - 36) Iteriere diese Schritte so lange, bis ein lokales Maximum gefunden wurde. Ergodisches Modell Unter dem ergodischen Modell versteht man im Kontext von HMMs die vollverbundene Topologie inclusive Schleifen. Bakis-Modell ( Links-nach-Rechts-Modell ) Unter dem Bakis-Modell versteht man im Kontext von HMMs eine Links-nach-Rechts Topologie, bei der maximal ein Zustand übersprungen werden kann. Das bedeutet, es gibt eine Ordnung über den Zuständen. Von einem Zustand $i$ kommt man in die Zustände $i, i+1, i+2$. Die drei Probleme von HMMs sind P1 - Evaluierungsproblem : Wie wahrscheinlich ist eine Sequenz \\(\\bf{o} = o_1 o_2 \\dots o_T\\) gegeben ein HMM \\(\\lambda\\) , also \\(P(\\bf{o}|\\lambda)\\) . P2 - Dekodierungsproblem : Finden der wahrscheinlichsten Zustandssequenz \\(s_1, \\dots, s_T\\) , gegeben eine Sequenz von Beobachtungen \\(\\bf{o} = o_1 o_2 \\dots o_T\\) . P3 - Lernproblem : Optimieren der Modellparameter Anwendungen: Gestenerkennung Phonem-Erkennung Markov Logik Netze Slides: MLI_11-MLN_slides1 Markov Logik Netze sind Sammlungen von Tupeln aus Gewichten \\(w_i\\) und prädikatenlogischen Formeln. Die Idee hinter Markov Logik Netzen ist ein aufweichen der harten Bedingungen der Prädikatenlogik. Eine prädikatenlogische Formel ist entweder wahr oder falsch. Eine Formel in MLNs kann auch \"meistens\" erfüllt sein. Das wird durch das Gewicht repräsentiert. Markov Logik Netze ( MLN ) Ein Markov Logik Netz ist ein Menge aus Tupeln $L = (F_i, w_i)$, wobei $F_i$ eine Formel der Prädikatenlogik erster Ordnung und $w_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ ein Gewicht ist. Ein MLN ist eine Schablone für ein MRF. Markov Random Field ( Markov Netzwerk , MRF ) Ein MRF ist ein ungerichtetes Probabilistisches Grafisches Modell. MRFs sind zur Modellierung von Korrelation geeignet. Verbundwahrscheinlichkeit in MLNs $P(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(\\sum_{i} w_i f_i(x))$ wobei $f_i$ das $i$-te Feature und $w_i$ ein Gewicht ist. Beispielsweise könnte $$f_i(x) = f_i(\\text{smoking}, \\text{cancer}) = \\begin{cases}1 &\\text{if } \\neg \\text{smoking} \\lor \\text{cancer}\\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$$ gelten. Inferenz in MLNs MAP : \\begin{align}\\text{arg max}_y P(y | x) &= \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(\\sum_{i} w_i n_i(x, y))\\\\ &= \\sum_{i} w_i n_i(x, y) \\end{align} Siehe auch: Matthew Richardson, Pedro Domingos: Markov logic networks Pedro Domingos, Matthew Richardson: Markov Logic: A Unifying Framework for Statistical Relational Learning , 2007.

Difference between genetic algorithms and evolution strategies? Individuum Eine mögliche Hypothese Population ( Generation ) Hypothesenmenge Erzeugung von Nachkommen Generierung neuer Hypothesen durch Rekombination und Mutation Fitness-Funktion Die Fitness-Funktion ist das zu optimierende Kriterium. Sie beschreibt die Güte einer Hypothese. Selektion Auswahl der Hypothesen, welche die beste Problemlösung erzeugen. Evolutionäre Strategien Das Wissen wird durch reele Zahlen und Vektoren repräsentiert. Genetische Programmierung Das Wissen wird duch baumartige Strukturen repräsentiert. Mutation Unter Mutation versteht man die zufällige Änderung einzelner Gene. Beispiele: Bit-Inversion: Zufällig Gleichverteilt pro Gen / Feste Anzahl, aber zufällige Gene Translation: Verschieben von Teilsequenzen Invertiertes Einfügen Spezielle Mutationsoperatoren sind anwendungsspezifisch Rekombination Bei der Rekombination werden die Eigenschaften zweier Eltern gemischt. Dies kann Diskret passieren, wenn manche Gene von einem Elternteil übernommen werden und andere vom anderen Elternteil. Alternativ kann die Rekombination auch durch intermediäre Rekombination passieren. Das bedeutet, das ein Gen gemittelt wird. Grundalgorithmus: Fitness-Function f Population p while f(p) ≠ optimal: p_parents ← selection(p) p_children ← generate_children(p_parents) p ← p_parents + p_children fitness ← f(p) p ← selection_kill(p, fitness) Probleme: Genetischer Drift: Manche Individuen vermehren sich zufällig mehr als andere. Diese sind nicht unbedingt besser für das Problem geeignet. Crowding, Ausreißerproblem: Fitte Individuen dominieren die Population. Das ist ein Problem wegen lokaler Maxima. Mating: Inselmodell: Die Evolution läuft weitgehend getrennt. Es passiert nur vereinzelt, dass Individuen der Inseln ausgetauscht werden. Nachbarschaftsmodell: Nachkommen dürfen nur von Individuen erzeugt werden, die in ihrer Nachbarschaft die beste Fitness besitzen Globales Modell: Alle dürfen sich mit allen verbinden. Evolution: Lamark'sche Evolution: Die Individuen ändern sich nach der Erzeugung. Sie lernen also. Dabei wird der Genotyp verändert und auch vererbt. Baldwin'sche Evolution: Die Individuen ändern sich nach der Erzeugung, aber der Genotyp bleibt gleich Hybride Verfahren: Es gibt sich verändernde und gleich bleibende Phänotypen. Anwendungen: Traveling Salesman Flugplanoptimierung Mischung von Kaffesorten Cybermotten: Motten müssen optimales Muster finden, um sich vor einer Fläche weißen Rauschens zu verbergen. Snakebot (Ivan Tanev) [ Pro06 ] Deduktives Lernen Slides: MLI_13_DeduktivesLernen_slides1.pdf Siehe auch: Formale Systeme Modus Ponens $$\\frac{A, A \\rightarrow B}{B}$$ Erklärungsbasiertes Lernen ( EBL , Explanation Based Learning by [ Mit97 ]) The key insight behind explanation-based generalization is that it is possible to form a justified generalization of a single positive training example provided the learning system is endowed with some explanatory capabilitie . In particular, the system must be able to explain to itself why the training example is an example of the concept under study. Thus, the generalizer is presumed to possess a definition of the concept under study as well as domain knowledge for constructing the required explanation. Explanation Based Generalization ( EBG ) EBG ist ein Prozess, bei dem implizites Wissen in explizites umgewandelt wird. EBG geht wie folgt vor: Explain: Finden einer Erklärung, warum das Beispiel die Definition des Zielkonzepts erfüllt. Dies ist einfaches Anwenden des Modus Ponens. Generalize: Generalisieren der Erklärung; bestimme also hinreichende Bedingungen unter denen die gefundene Erklärungsstruktur gültig ist. Bei der EBG werden also Makro-Operatoren erzeugt. Ein Beispiel für Software welche EBG benutzt ist STRIPS . KBANN ( Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks ) KBANN ist ein hybrides Verfahren. Die Idee ist ein neuronales Netz geschickt zu konstruieren. Dieses wird dann wie gewohnt mit Gradient Descent durch Trainingsbeispiele verfeinert. Der Algorithmus gibt eine Netzarchtiktur vor: Dabei wird pro Instanzattribut ein Netz-Input verwendet. Für jede Klausel wird ein Neuron hinzugefügt. Dieses ist mit dem Instanzattribut durch das Gewicht $w$ verbunden wenn es nicht negiert ist, sonst durch das Gewicht $-w$. Der Schwellwert der Aktivierungsfunktion wird auf $-(n- 0.5)w$ gesetzt, wobei $n$ die Anzahl der nicht-negierten Bedingungsteile ist. Verbinde die restlichen Neuronen von Schicht $i$ mit Schicht $i+1$ indem zufällige kleine Gewichte gesetzt werden. Angewendet werden kann KBANN: Lernen von physikalischen Objektklassen Erkennung von biologischen Konzepten in DNS-Sequenzen Unüberwachte Lernverfahren Slides: MLI_14_UnueberwachtesLernen_slides1.pdf $k$-means Clustering Der $k$-means Clustering Algorithmus finden $k$ Cluster in einem Datensatz. Dabei ist $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$ vom Benutzer zu wählen. Zuerst initialisert $k$-means die Zentroiden, also zentrale Punkte für Cluster, zufällig. Dann geht $k$-means geht iterativ vor: Weise jeden Datenpunkt seinem nächsten Cluster zu. Verschiebe die $k$ Zentroide in ihr Clusterzentrum Siehe auch: Interaktives Beispiel Fuzzy $k$-means Im Gegensatz zum $k$-means Algorithmus, wo jeder Datenpunkt in genau einem Cluster ist, weißt der Fuzzy $k$-means Algorithmus jedem Datenpunkte eine Zugehörigkeitswahrscheinlichkeit zu. Je weiter der Datenpunkt vom Zentroid entfernt ist, desto unwahrscheinlicher wird die Zugehörigkeit. Die Cluster-Zugehörigkeit des Datenpunktes $x_i$ zum Cluster $c_j$ kann als Wahrscheinlichkeit in Abhängigkeit der Distanz $$d_{ij} = |x_i - z_j|&#94;2$$ zum Zentroiden $z_j$ ausgedrückt werden: $$P(c_j | x_i) = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{d_{ij}})&#94;{\\frac{1}{b-1}}}{\\sum_{r=1}&#94;k (\\frac{1}{d_{ir}})&#94;{\\frac{1}{b-1}}}$$ wobei $b \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 1}$ ein frei zu wählender Parameter ist. Die Zentroide werden dann wie folgt neu berechnet: $$z_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n [P(z_j|x_i)]&#94;b \\cdot x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n [P(z_j | x_i)]&#94;b}$$ Hierarchisches Clustern Die Idee des hierarchischen Clusterns ist die iterative Vereinigung von Clustern zu größeren Clustern. Ergebisse können durch ein Dendrogramm beschrieben werden. Anwendung: Einordnung von Schrauben in ein Ordnungssystem Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering ( AHC ) AHC ist ein hierarchisches Clusteringverfahren. Dabei ist ein Clusterdistanz-Schwellwert $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ und eine minimale Cluster-Anzahl $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ zu wählen. Auch ein Distanzmaß für Cluster (nearest neighbor, farest neighor, mean distance, ...) ist als Hyperparameter zu wählen. Dann geht AHC wie folgt vor: c ← k # Minimale Anzahl an Clustern c' ← n # Anzahl der Datenpunkte # Weise jedem Punkt sein eigenes Clusterzentrum zu for i in range(1, n): D_i ← {x_i} # Vereinige Clusterzentren do: c' := c' -1 find closest clusters D_i, D_j if d(D_i, D_j) ⩽ t: merge(D_i, Dj) else: break until c = c' The result can be visualized as a Dendrogramm. Begriffliche Ballung Bei Algorithmen der Begrifflichen Ballung werden Konzeptbeschreibungen generiert. COBWEB Cobweb ist ein Algorithmus zur begrifflichen Ballung. Er lernt durch inkrementelles Aufbauen eines Strukturbaumes. Dabei sind nominale Attribute gestattet. Dabei wird ein Datenpunkt $x_i$ zum Cluster $c_j$ geclustert, wenn man die Attributwerte von $x_i$ durch die Kentniss von $c_j$ gut vorhersagen kann ( $P(x_i | c_j)$ , predictability) und zugleich der Cluster gut vorhergesagt werden kann, wenn die Attributwerte gegeben sind ( $P(c_j|x_i)$ , predictiveness). Es soll also in inter-Klassenähnlichkeit minimiert und die intra-Klassenähnlichkeit maximimiert werden. Dafür wird die Category Utility verwendet: $$\\text{CU} = \\sum_{k=1}&#94;K \\sum_{i=1}&#94;I \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{J(i)} P(A_i = V_{ij}) \\cdot P(A_i = V_ij | C_k) \\cdot P(C_k | A_i = V_{ij})$$ Dabei gilt: $K$: Anzahl der Cluster $I$: Anzahl der Attribute $J(i)$: Anzahl der Attributwerte des $i$-ten Attributs $V_{ji}$: $j$-ter möglicher Wert für Attribut $i$ $P(A_i = V_ij | C_k)$: Predictability $P(C_k | A_i = V_{ij}$: Predictiveness Anwendung: Interpretation von EMGs Prüfungsfragen Was ist Induktives Lernen? → Eine große Menge an Beispielen wird gegeben.

Ditherhing ( Fehlerdiffusion ) Ditherhing ist eine Methode zur Illusion einer größeren Farbtiefe. Gamma-Korrektur $$I_{\\text{out}} = I_{\\text{in}}&#94;\\gamma$$ Transferfunktion Eine Abbildung $f$ von Farbwerten auf Helligeit: $$f: [0, N] \\rightarrow [I_{\\text{min}}, I_{\\text{max}}]$$ Diese Abbildung ist abhängig vom Display. Dynamikumfang Der Dynamikumfang beschreibt den erreichbaren Kontrast eines Wiedergabegrätes (Bildschirm, Beamer): $$R_d = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}} + k}{I_{\\text{min}} + k}$$ $k$ ist dabei das Umgebungslicht, $I_{max} / I_{min}$ sind Konstanten des Displays und geben die maximale bzw. minimale Helligkeit an. Gammut ( Farbgammut ) Der Gamut eines Monitors entspricht dem Spektrum der darauf darstellbaren Farben. Farbtemperatur Die Farbtemperatur ist ein Maß, um einen jeweiligen Farbeindruck einer Lichtquelle zu bestimmen. Schwarzkörper , Schwarzkörperstrahlung Ein Schwarzkörper ist eine idealisierte thermische Strahlungsquelle. Die idealisierung besteht darin, dass der Körper die komplette auftretende Strahlung vollständig absorbiert. Gleichzeitig sendet er Wärmestrahlung (Schwarzkörperstrahlung) aus, welche nur von seiner Temperatur abhängig ist. Slide: 01_ Bilder, Farbe, Perzeption - Teil2.pdf Additive Farmbischung Grundfarben: Rot, Grün, Blau Anwendung: Bildschirm Subtraktive Farbmischung Grundfarben: Cyan, Magenta, Gelb Anwendung: Drucker Graßmansche Gesetze Jeder Farbeindruck kann mit 3 Grundgrößen beschrieben werden. Weber-Fechner-Gesetz Das Weber-Fechner-Gesetz macht eine Aussage über die subjektiv empfundene Stärke von Sinneseindrücken im Abhängigkeit von der Intensität des Helligkeitsunterschiedes: $$E = c \\cdot \\frac{R}{R_0}$$ wobei $E$ die empfundene Reizstärke, $c$ eine Konstante, $R$ die tatsächliche Reizstärke und $R_0$ eine Referenzreizstärke ist. RGB-Farbraum: Addition der Spektren, wird bei CRT/LCD-Farbmonitoren verwendet. CMY, CMYK: Subtraktive Farbmischung, wird bei Druckern verwendet. K (schwarz) nur aus praktischen Gründen.

Dabei geht man prinzipiell wie folgt vor: Strahlerzeugung : Für jeden Pixel werden Sichtstrahlen erzeugt Schnittberechnung : Finde das primitiv (z.B. Dreieck) welches der Strahl schneidet und welches am nächsten zur Kamera ist und vor der Kamera liegt. Schattierung : Beleuchtungsberechnung (shading) Phong-Beleuchtungsmodell Das Phong-Beleuchtungsmodell besteht aus 3 Komponenten: Ambiente Beleuchtung: Materialkoeffizient $k_a$. Ambiente Beleuchtung ist indirekte Beleuchtung, also Licht von anderen Oberflächen Diffuse Beleuchtung: Materialkoeffizient $k_d$. Diffuse Beleuchtung ist die Streuung des Lichts nahe beim \"Streupunkt\" (nach dem Lambertschen Gesetz). Spekulare Beleuchtung: Materialkoeffizient $k_s$ sowie Phong-Exponent $n$. Unter spekularer Beleuchtung versteht man direkte Spiegelung der Lichtquelle (imperfekte Spiegelung) Das Ergibt folgende Formel für die Intensität $I$: $$I = \\overbrace{k_a \\cdot I_L}&#94;{\\text{ambient}} + \\overbrace{k_d \\cdot I_L \\cdot (N \\cdot L)}&#94;{\\text{diffus}} + \\overbrace{k_s \\cdot I_L \\cdot (R_L \\cdot V)&#94;n}&#94;{\\text{spekular}}$$ hierbei ist $I_L$ die Lichtintensität, die Richtung die das Licht nimmt $L$ sowie die Oberflächennormale $N$ und der Lichtreflektionsvektor $R_L$. Der Vektor $R_L$ liegt in der selben Ebene wie $N$ und $L$. Es gilt $R_L = 2N \\cdot (N \\cdot L) - L$. Z-Fighting Polygone, welche in der selben Ebene liegen führen zu einem Flackern welches der beiden Polygone nun angezeigt wird. Dies kann verhindert werden, indem eines der Polygone minimal verschoben wird. Tessellation Parkettierung, also das Füllen einer Fläche mit Primitiven. Distributed Ray Tracing Bilder welche mit dem Whitted-Style Ray Tracing Verfahren gerendert wurden sehen zu perfekt aus. Die perfekte Spiegelung und Trasmission, die harten Schattenkanten und die unendliche Schärfentiefe kennen wir von realen Kameras so nicht. Distributed Ray Tracing ist eine alternative zu Whitted-Style Ray Tracing, welche diese Probleme zu lösen versucht. Dabei wird bei jeder Spiegelung nicht ein Schattenstrahl verschickt, sondern viele welche sich um den \"Perfekten\" Strahl konzentrieren.

Fernpunkte ergänzt. Rotation Die Rotation um (0, 0) in homogenen Koordinaten geht wie folgt: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\\cos \\alpha & -\\sin \\alpha & 0\\\\ \\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 '& 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ Skalierung Eine Skalierung in homogenen Koordinaten geht wie folgt: $$\\begin{pmatrix}s_x & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & s_y & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & s_x & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ Scherung Eine Scherung in homogenen Koordinaten geht wie folgt: $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & d_x & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & d_y & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ Koordinatensysteme Objektkoordinaten: Sie werden durch die Modelltransformation zu Weltkoordinaten: Sie werden durch die Kameratransformation zu Kamerakoordinaten Der Ursprung des Welt-Koordiantensystems wird mit 0 bezeichnet. Die Basisvektoren mit $x, y$. Das Modellkoordinatensystem hat den Ursprung $e$ und die Basisvektoren $u, v$ Transformationen werden grundsätzlich so dargestellt: $$x' \\gets M \\cdot x$$ Es wird also der zu transformierende Vektor von rechts mit der Transformationsmatrix $M$ multipliziert. Spiegelung an der $y$-Achse ist eine Multiplikation der $x$-Koordinaten mit (-1) Hierarchisches Modellieren, Szenengraph Übungsfolien: 02_ Bildoperationen.pdf Filter ( Bildfilter ) Ein Bildfilter ist ein Algorithmus, welcher als Input ein Bild bekommt und als Output ein Bild liefert. Typischerweise werden lineare Filter verwendet. Beispiele: Helligkeitsänderung Kontraständerung (z.B. unschärfe (blur), schärfen (sharpen)) Desaturierung Kantendetektion Linearer Filter Gewichtete Summe benachbarter Pixel-Werte. Siehe Interaktives Beispiel Morphologische Filter Strukturverändernde Operation (z.B. Dilatation, Erosion, Öffnung, Schließung) Texturen Slide: 04_ Texturen.pdf Texturen Texturen können vielfältig eingesetzt werden: Klassische Feinstrukturierung Reflektionseigenschaften Farbe Normalenvektoren (Bump- oder Normal mapping) Beleuchtung Environment Mapping, Reflection Mapping Shadow Mapping, Light Mapping Geometrie (Displacement Mapping) Texturkoordinaten werden üblicherweise mit $(s, t)$ bezeichnet. Manchmal auch mit $(u, v)$. Eine Textur ist im Einheitsquadrat. Eine Textur kann folgendermaßen auf ein Objekt gemappt werden, indem das Objekt in einen Hilfskörper (z.B. Kugel, Würfel, Zylinder) gesteckt wird, auf welchen die Textur bereits gemappt wurde. Dann kann die Textur folgendermaßen auf das Objekt übertragen werden: Normale des Hilfskörpers auf das Objekt Normale des Objekts auf den Hilfskörper Linie durch den Mittelpunkt des Objekts auf den Hilfskörper Environment Map Eine Environment-Map ist eine Textur zur Darstellung der Umgebung. Bei Einvironment-Maps nimmt man an, dass der Betrachter weit genug von der Umgebung entfernt ist, sodass die Position keine Rolle spielt und ausschließlich die Blickrichtung wichtig ist. Übliche Parametrisierungen von Environment-Maps sind: Cube Maps + ist bei korrekter Filterung nahtlos + keine Singularität am Rand Sphere Maps - Singularität am Rand + mit Kamera, Chromkugel und Photoshop kann sie recht einfach aufgenommen / erstellt werden LatLong-Map - die Pole werden ungleichmäßig abgetastet Eine Anwendung war der \"flüssige\" Terminator im Hubschrauber (Terminator 2). Cube Map Um den Hintergrund darzustellen, kann man die Szene in einen von innen texturierten Cubus stecken. Ein Reflektionsrichtung $\\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ bestimmt den Punkt auf dem Mantel des Würfels. Die betragsmäßig größte Komponente von $\\mathbf{r}$ bestimmt, welche Würfelfläche (links, rechts, vorne, hinten, oben, unten) genommen wird. Abhängig von der orientierung des koordinatensystems in bezug auf die Cube map kann sich dann also folgende Regel ergeben: Wenn $|r_x|$ am größten ist, ist es rechts (< 0) oder links (> 0), wenn $|r_y|$ am größten ist, ist es vorne (< 0) oder hinten (> 0) wenn $|r_z|$ am größten ist, ist es oben (< 0) oder unten (> 0) Die Texturkoordinaten $(s, t)$ werden z.B. für (right) wie folgt erechnet: $$s = \\frac{r_y}{2 \\cdot r_x}, \\;\\;\\; t = \\frac{r_z}{2 \\cdot r_x}$$ Mip-Map ( Mip map , Mipmap , Auflösungspyramide ) Mip steht für lat. multum in parvo (viel in wenig). Eine Mip-Map ist eine Vorfilterung von Texturen. Mip-Mapping hilft, wenn man in einem sehr flachem Winkel auf eine Ebene blickt. In einer Mip-Map wird die Original-Textur gespeichert, dann in der ersten Stufe eine Textur welche in beiden Dimensionen auf die hälfte verkleinert wurde (also 1/4 der ursprünglichen Größe). Es wird diejenige Mip-Map Stufe $n$ gewählt, sodass gilt $$\\text{Texelgröße}(n) \\leq \\text{Größe Pixelfootprint auf Textur} < Texelgröße(n+1)$$ Dann wird eine Trilineare Interpolation der 8 nächsten Texel durchgeführt: Bilinear auf Stufe $n$, bilinear auf Stufe $n+1$ linear zwischen diesen beiden Farben Mip-Maps benötigen zusätzlich 1/3 der ursprünglichen Texturgröße. Isotrope Texturfilterung Eine Texturfilterung heißt isotrop, wenn sie in alle Richtungen gleich ist. Anisotrope Texturfilterungen sind gewünscht, weil sie in die Tiefe schärfe erhalten können, wohingegen isotrope Texturfilterung in die ferne unscharf wirken können. RIPmaps sind anisotrope Texturfilterungen. Übungsfolien: 04_ Texturen und Transformationen.pdf Limitationen von Whitted-Style Raytracing Keine Kaustiken oder korrekte Dispersion Keine indirekte Beleuchtung Keine Flächenlichtquellen Kein Motion-Blur oder Tiefenunschärfe Mögliche Lösung: Distributed Raytracing Stratified Supersampling Strahlen werden durch zufällige Superpixelpositionen geschossen, aber möglichst gleichmäßig um Klumpen zu vermeiden. Transformationen Texturen Repeating / Clamping Bilineare Filterung Aliasing bei Verkleinerung Lösung: Überabtastung oder Vorfilterung (z.B. Mip-Maps) Mip-Maps Auswahl der richtigen Texturgröße Räumliche Datenstrukturen Slide: 05_ Raumliche Datenstrukturen.pdf (10.12.2015) Räumliche Datenstrukturen Hüllkörper Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) Bounding Volume Hierachies (BVH) Reguläre Gitter Oktalbaum (Octree) kD-Baum AABB ( Axis-Aligned Bounding Box ) Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes sind Rechtecke (Quader in 3D), deren Seiten parallel zu den Achsen des Koordinatensystems stehen. Sie werden als Hüllkörper verwendet. Alles wichtige zu AABBs kann man in Folie 18 - 29 nachlesen. BSP-Baum ( Binary Space Partition Baum ) Teile den Raum mithilfe von Ebenen in zwei Teile. Die Ebenen dürfen beliebig im Raum liegen. Somit wird eine Baumstruktur aufgebaut, welche den Raum in immer kleinere Teile teilt. kD-Baum Ein BSP-Baum, welcher nur achsenparallele Ebenen erlaubt. Der Raum wird also mit achsenparallelen Hyperebenen geteilt; es entsteht ein Binärbaum welcher den Raum partitioniert. Surface Area Heuristic ( SAH ) Wähle die Split-Ebene so, dass die Kosten der Traversierung minimiert werden. Bounding-Volume-Hierachies ( BVH ) BVHs sind eine Datenstruktur, welche den Raum in Hüllkörper unterteilt. Man hat also komplexe Objekte. Für diese Objekte muss man Schnittests machen. Das bedeutet im einfachsten Fall, dass man für $n$ Dreiecke und einen Strahl genau $n$ Schnittests machen muss. Interessanterweise dürfen sich Hüllkörper überlappen. Nun könnte man aber - je nach den Objekten - diese in jeweils zwei Quader unterteilen. Wenn der Strahl nur einen Quader schneidet, dann muss man auch nur für die Objekte in diesem Quader Schnittests durchführen. Innerhalb des Quaders kann man natürlich noch weiter die Objekte in Hüllkörper (üblicherweise Quader) unterteilen. Typische Hüllkörper sind: AABB: Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes Bounding Spheres OBB: Oriented Bounding Boxes Slabs: Schnitt von Paaren paralleler Halbebenen Die SAH ist ein Kriterium zum aufbau von BVHs / kD-Bäumen. Im Mittel sollen zufällige Strahlen, die den betrachteten Knoten schneiden, den gleichen Aufwand verursachen, egal welcher Kindknoten traversiert wird Oktalbäume ( Octree ) Gitter Schnitttests können beschleunigt werden, indem über den Raum ein Gitter gelegt wird. Der Raum wird also in kleinere Teile zerlegt. Ein Octree unterteilt einen Quader in 8 kleiner Quader. Diese können wiederum in 8 kleinere Quader unterteilt werden. Mailboxing Speichern des Ergebnisses eines Schnitttests mit einem Objekt, um erneute Schnitttests zu verhindern. Übungsfolien: 05_ BVH.pdf Median-Split: Die Entscheidung wird anhand der Mittelpunkte der AABBs getroffen. Rasterisierung, Clipping und Projektionstransformationen Side: 06_ Rasterisierung, Clipping und Projektionstransformationen.pdf Tiefenpuffer ( Z-Buffer ) Es wird ein Bild gespeichert, welches für jeden Pixel die Tiefe des vordersten Objekts angibt. Tiefentest Finden des Bildteiles, der für einen gegebenen Pixel am nächsten vor der Kamera ist. Clipping Abschneiden von Linien und Poligonen, die außerhalb des sichtbaren Bereichs liegen. Dies ist wichtig für die behandlung problematischer Fälle bei Projektionen. Algorithmus von Sutherland-Hodgeman Dient dem Clipping von Polygonen. Frustum Ein Frustum ist ein Kegelstumpf, wobei in der Computergrafik eher ein Pyramidenstumpf gemeint ist. Das View Frustum ist der Bereich der Szene, der sichtbar ist. Outcodes Outcodes sind ein 4-Bit binärcode für die Bereiche um die Zeichenebene: $$(x < x_{\\text{min}}, x > x_{\\text{max}}, y < y_{\\text{min}}, y > y_{\\text{max}})$$ Übungsfolien: 09_ Clipping.pdf Clipping von Linien Ein Rechteck $(x_{\\text{min}}, x_{\\text{max}}, y_{\\text{min}}, y_{\\text{max}})$ und eine Linie $P_1 = (x_1, y_1), P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ ist gegeben. Es gibt den \"trivial reject\" Fall, bei dem die komplette Linie außerhalb liegt und den \"trivial accept\" Fall, bei dem die komplette Linie innerhalb des Rechtecks liegt. Cohen-Sutherland Algorithmus Der Cohen-Sutherland Algorithmus dient dem Clipping von Linien mit einem Rechteck. Man unterteilt die Ebene, in der das Rechteck liegt in 9 Bereiche: (links oben, links mitte, links unten, mitte oben, mitte mitte,...). Die Punkte bekommen nun jeweils einen \"Outcode\" der ihre Position bzgl. dieser Bereiche bestimmt: $$\\text{Outcode} = (x < x_{\\text{min}}, x > x_{\\text{max}}, y < y_{\\text{min}}, y > y_{\\text{max}})$$ Mit den Outcodes gilt nun: Trivial Accept: Outcode($P_1$) $\\lor$ Outcode($P_2$) = 0 Trivial Reject: Outcode($P_1$) $\\land$ Outcode($P_2$) $\\neq$ 0 Interessant ist, dass in den nicht-trivialen Fällen zwar immer ein Teil der Strecke außerhalb des Rechtecks liegt, aber nicht unbedingt auch ein Teil innerhalb des Rechtecks liegen muss. $\\alpha$-Clipping Führe Window Edge Coordinates (WEC) ein. Diese sind ein vorzeichenbehafteter Abstand zu den Clipping-Kanten. Wenn eine Koordinate negativ ist, dann liegt der Punkt außerhalb des Rechtecks. Ich habe den Algorithmus in Python-Pseudocode geschrieben. Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Clipping wird Kante für Kante durchgeführt.

Sure, on the client side there is pretty much only JavaScript (including variants like CoffeeScript and TypeScript ) in combination with HTML and CSS. I've used MySQL and Redis databases and I'm quite happy with that. But the choice for the server side is not that easy. I've been using PHP for quite a while now, because it was the cheapest and easiest choice when I started programming. But things have changed (and I have more money, so I don't have to take the super cheap hosting services). Although my experience with web projects is very limited, I want to share a few thoughts. Definitions: Back End and Security Just for clarification: I am only talking about the back end. A back end is the data access layer which manages requests comming to the server. It needs to server many requests (> 100 requests/second) fast (< 300 ms in average). It should not execute computationally heavy jobs which can be pre-computed or do not need to be displayed instantly to the client. This can be done by another system which does not need to be programmed in the same language. The back end does also not deal with presentation to the user. This is what the front end does. However, you should have more than a good idea in which form the front end gets the data. The cleanest approach I've seen so far is a pure RESTful API for all interactions between front end and back end. The backend language should also make it easy to validate / sanitize input data, connect with databases, store/get stuff on/from the file system. In the following, I will write that some languages are \"secure\" or \"not secure\". This does not mean that you can / cannot write code which is secure. It means that the compiler (or other widespread tools) give you guarantees about bugs in your code. For example, C is a very insecure language as the compiler does no bounds checking . The types of errors which can be detected by automatic tools (without further testing) are: Syntax errors, Out of bounds (reading), buffer overflow (not checked in C/C++, but not possible in Java ( source )), unused variables (which might indicate other problems; at least code smell), type problems: This is a bit fuzzy, as you can write stringly typed code (see New Programming Jargon ) in probably every language, but in some languages it is more common than in others. Some languages also make it easier to use the type system to detect errors. For example, PHP is very insecure in this sense as 123 == \"123ab\" , Python is a bit more secure, but you can return whatever you want, Java is much more secure. Haskell is even more secure in this sense, as it has real functions (without side effects, checked by the compiler). See What can Haskell's type system do that Java's can't and vice versa? for more. There are also some errors which can be detected at runtime. The handling of those runtime errors differs from language to language. For example, C and C++ fails silently (e.g. this question ). This is bad. For example, there are some silent out-of-bounds errors in C / C++ where Rust would fail loud (I think Heartbleed is one example; see Would Rust have prevented Heartbleed? Another look if you're interested in that specific example). Of course, all of those problems can be detected with good testing. But the more is done automatically, the less can go wrong when you don't write (good) tests. Java Java is an object-oriented language which runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Java is probably the most used language for big business websites. Why is that the case? Java is old: It first appeared in 1995. Java is taught at many universities and many people know at least a little bit of Java. So companies don't have problems finding developers. At least that might be the impression of people who don't realize that there is a big differencee between people saying they know Java and developers who can actually work with it. I guess the Java ecosystem is pretty mature: eclipse , IntelliJ IDEA and Netbeans as IDEs, Jenkins for continuous integration, GlassFish , Apache Ant / Apache Maven or Gradle for automatic building, JUnit , Mockito , Powermock for automatic unit tests, log4J and log4J 2 for logging, Apache JMeter for load testing Jersey for RESTful Web services, Apache Tomcat / WildFly (former JBoss): application server / web server / servlet container Grizzly / Jetty : Web server FindBugs , SonarQube for code quality / static code analysis Hibernate for ORM, OSGi : Apache Felix / Equinox - see 10min clip for a high-level explanation of OSGi, Frameworks like Spring , JSF , JSP , Apache Struts 2 , Apache Wicket Java is developed by Oracle . Hence you can make contracts with Oracle to get support when things don't work. That was what we have on the positive side. What is not so good about Java? VERY clumsy syntax. This is more than just a inconvenience. You have to type a lot to get things done which makes you slow. Of course, you can (and need to) use autocompletion, but it is still a lot to read. That makes maintaining the code a mess. Tools are hard to get to work. Unnecessary super-abstract constructs used for eventually never happening future extensions (see Geek-and-poke.com ). A bit more secure than C/C++ as you cannot access out-of-bound arrays, you don't have pointers. So buffer overflows are almost impossible in Java (see SO for more details). However, you buy this security with much less easy syntax and you don't get as much security as would be possible with just a bit more effort. See rust for more details. Speed and memory usage: Again, Java might be better in speed than many other languages, but not as good as some others are. And Java seems to need A LOT of memory. However, I am not too sure if that is really a problem. (see Surprise! Java is fastest for server-side Web apps ) See also: Is Java a Compiled or an interpreted programming language? : The short answer is no. But Java guys don't like to hear that ☺ Why do I hear about so many Java insecurities? Are other languages more secure? : The short answer is no, thinking about C/C++. Security of JVM for Server C++ performance vs. Java/C# JavaScript: Node.js Node.js is a runtime environment which was initially released in 2009 and became quite popular since then. Node.js is asynchronous, event-driven and scalable. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and hence have all the advantages of JavaScript: They profit from heavy development in JavaScript engines / JIT compilers like V8 . The syntax is flexible and light-weight. Just like Java, JavaScript first appeared in 1995. So the language itself is old and stable. A lot of developers know at least a little bit of JavaScript. The ecosystem is mature. npm and bower for package management Backbone.js / AngularJS for MVP / MVC. Unit.js for unit testing. Grunt as a task runner. Sequelize as an ORM. Karma : Test runner expressjs : web application framework Lots of easy tutorials What is still to say? Node is FAST and scalable! (see Performance Comparison Between Node.js and Java EE ) JavaScript is very insecure. Even simple syntax error will only get revealed when they are actually executed. So Unit testing is very important. Node.js is used by LinkedIn, Yahoo!, Uber, PayPal ( source ) There are quite a few people moving from Node.js to Go ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) See also: How to decide when to use Node.js? How to debug Node.js applications node.js tutorial Go Go is a statically-typed, compiled language developed by Google. It first appeared in 2009, so it is very young. Go offers the basic tools you need for web development: martini / Gin Gonic : A web development framework mustache for templates gorm : ORM Good tutorial and also some material for web development Some tasks are much more complicated than they should be. Sorting, to name one example (see SO ). Go is different from some other languages, e.g. if you want a method to be public, the first character of the method name has to be capitalized. Or unused variables result in a compiler error. See also: Gin Gonic May Be 40x Faster Than Martini, But It Is Not Better Go vs Node.js for servers C# C# is a compiled, statically typed language (with dynamic features, see Understanding the Dynamic Keyword in C# 4 ) developed by Microsoft. It was publically announced in 2000. The initial release of its web appliction framework ASP.NET was in 2002. The ecosystem seems to include: nuget.org IIS : Web server Entity Framework : ORM LINQ : SQL queries Visual Studio : IDE ASP.NET MVC Framework But I don't know enough about C# / ASP.NET to write something meaningful about it. Coding Horror described why they use ASP.NET for StackOverflow and why he doesn't recommend it for OpenSource projects ( source ). StackExchange also describes what they use ( 1 , 2 ). I see a big problem in the Microsoft-centric technology stack. You have to use everything from them. (Almost) everything is closed source. If they discontinue the development or if they don't fix stuff which might be relevant for you, you're fucked. This seems to change. Microsoft moved some important parts of their stack to GitHub (see dotnet.github.io ). Most important seems to be that the compiler Roslyn is licensed under an Apache License. But there is also ASP.NET, the Entity Framework, and the .NET runtime. The Visual Studio Community Edition is not available for free (but only for Windows). Python Python is one of the oldest programming languages which are still in use. It first appeared in 1991. Python is dynamically typed, interpreted, object-oriented and includes functional programming features. Although I use Python for many projects, I didn't use it by now for a web project. So I might not know the important tools / frameworks. Please keep that in mind. Ecosystem: pypi.python.org and pip : Package hosting and package management Sphinx : (Semi) automatic code documentation, e.g. the scipy docs are generated with Sphinx from Python code. This is one of the best documentations I have ever seen. Django / Flask as frameworks pytest / nose for testing gevent : a coroutine-based Python networking library Tornado : Web server Some Python people switch to Go ( 1 , 2 ) Many tutorials and often very good documentation: Flask djangobook.com and docs.djangoproject.com fullstackpython.com Flask and Django work with PyPy ( source ). That might make them much faster. Used by big players: Quora ( source ) Prezi, Pinterest, Instagram ( source ) Bitbucket, The Onion ( source ) I think one of the main advantages of Python is that it is really easy to write code which is easy to read (because of docstrings, Pythons weird intendation semantics and very nice syntax) and quite hard to write unreadable code. I am sure I have a biased view regarding Python, but I am also sure a lot of people share this subjective impression. PHP PHP is a server-side scripting language which appeared first in 1995. It is dynamically typed. Language inconsistencies are really bad with PHP - see also PHP: a fractal of bad design The ecosystem is ok: PHPCI for continuus integration. Zend Framework / Symfony Smaller Frameworks like CakePHP and Code Igniter Drupal / Joomla / TYPO3 / WordPress PHPUnit for unit testing, Composer for package management and packagist.org to find packages cruisecontrol for Continuus Integration A big advantage of PHP is that it is easy to learn. You can run PHP everywhere and hosting is cheap. Wikipedia makes use of PHP, so it is obviously possible to create systems which have HUGE numbers of requests and still work fine. The right tool for the right job - by commitstrip.com Hack Hack is a programming language introduced in 2014 by Facebook. It is a PHP dialect. Key differences to PHP are: Function arguments and return values can be annotated with types. Hack does not support some language features which are supported by PHP ( source ). Which is good. For example, goto, variable variables, string incrementing, ... See also: hacklang.org Rust Rust is a very safe language, but seems not to be ready for productive usage. I am a big fan of Rust, but as it aims to be a better C++, it is probably a better fit for OS development, game engines, embedded systems, databases, complex desktop applications (Photoshop/Word/Chrome), etc. While Rust is quite expressive for a systems programming language, its banner features are the borrow checker (+ lifetimes, etc) and powerful static type system. Rust emphasizes zero-cost abstractions with compiler-enforced memory & thread safety. The popular web development languages are dynamically typed and interpreted, with an emphasis on rapid development, which is a very different niche than Rust claims to fill. Source: news.ycombinator.com See: arewewebyet.com Rust Web Frameworks Others Ruby with Rails : I know it is quite well-known and used by many people. But I don't know Ruby enough to write anything meaningful. The Ruby syntax is similar to Python. Scala seems to be noteworthy See also Web Framework Benchmarks Usage of server-side programming languages for websites todobackend.com : A lot of different back end technology stacks bento.io : Seems to offer many tutorials The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings: January 2015 Comparison of programming languages Conclusion Thinking about it that carefully, I see three languages which seem to be suitable for back ends for me: Go: Fast and compiled node.js: Good scalability Python: It is the language I know best and of which I like the syntax best. Besides that, it has a very nice and clear syntax, good community-developed coding style standards and is very easy to read and well-documented. Not suitable seem to be: PHP: Because of the language inconsistencies which seem to make it pretty hard to make a reliable back end C#: The technology stack is too Microsoft centered. Java: Too clumsy syntax, too hard to get it work. The other programming languages could be very good choices. I simply don't know it. I am very curious if rust will be used for back ends. Hack is very young, let's see if it will spread in a few years. Credits As I don't have much experience with web development, I asked a few friends to have a look at the different parts of the article. They looked especially at plain wrong statements, if I named \"all\" the important frameworks / tools. They might not completely agree with the comparison to other language (after all, I wrote the article), but they helped me a lot to get things not too wrong: Sören Liebich ( @liebsoer ) has several years of experience with Java web development and helped me to name the important tools / technologies used in the Java stack. Henning Dieterichs helped me to fix some of the mistakes in the C# part and reminded me of Hack and the positive sides of PHP. Stefan had a look at the PHP section.

It was an interesting experience. Everything is so big, it is difficult to get a feeling for it if you haven't seen it yourself. For example, the WTC Memorial is overwhelmingly large. I tried to capture that in a photograph with my Panasonic DMC-TZ41, but it just doesn't look that large: WTC Memorial A photosphere captures that much better (it looks great on my Smartphone, but not nearly as well on the web): Android Photosphere Optonaut goes one step further. This app is able to create 3D photospheres. How it works - User perspective You start the app, slowly turn around yourself to capture everything around you. This includes your feet and the sky, if you really want a complete photosphere. The recording process the same as for Android Photospheres, but probably with a slightly different interface: Optograph recording process When you want to watch it in 3D you have to have something that holds it in front of your face at the right distance. Cardboard is an easy and cheap possibility to do so: Cardboard And, of course, you can already share optographs: Sharing Optographs How it works - Developers perspective Optonaut makes use of the camera and takes a lot of images. Those images are combined to a photosphere by a process called image stitching . This means you search points which seem to match to build one big image from many small images. A big problem is that your camera moves quite a lot in space and the environment changes. So there might not be any way to make a perfect match. Sensors like the compass and the accelerometer help to figure out at which direction you are currently pointing. Programs like hugin stitch images semi-automatically, but Optonaut works completely automatically. From my experience with Android Photospheres, this works much better when the objects around you are far away. That means it doesn't work in your room. Then Optonaut uses a technique called stereoscopy . They show you different images for each eye to give you the impression of a 3D image. They also use a different photosphere techique to \"mix images dynamically\". Optonaut claims that this does work for close objects (in contrast to the traditional photosphere apps like Google Photosphere, Photosynth or Microsoft ICE). As they can figure out where you look at with the accelerometer / compass, they adjust the images accordingly for each eye to create a 3D impression: Stereographic images produced by Optonaut Now it gets very interesting. Usually, you would need two cameras next to each other to take two slightly shifted images. But Optonaut needs only one camera. They make use of the fact that you rotate around your axis to photograph your environment. Optonaut takes two images which are next to each other, match them, deskew them. Et voilà: You are able to get a 3D impression! A side note: The 3D photosphere is stored as an archive of images. The Optonaut Team Optonaut has two founders: Emanuel Jöbstl and Johannes Schickling. I've had the luck to work with them in my first hackathon (CODEFEST8). We won in Karlsruhe with an App / web service with a fully automatic drivers logbook ( logbookapp.de ). Both of them are great developers. Emanuel created the (working!) Android app which connected to the car within a couple of hours and Johannes made a beatiful frontend in the same time. Emanuel knows a lot about protocols, can understand mathematically complex algorithms and solve conceptually difficult problems. I guess he wrote the stitching algorithm. I've learned a lot from Johannes about tools. He is a perfectionist. In situations where most people would say \"hey, it works, lets drink some coffee\" he is still working hard to get the best user experience, making the code more maintainable by refactoring it, improving the way how code is built / deployed. In a short-term project this costs probably more time than doing it quick-and-dirty, but on the medium/long run (e.g. more than 2 weeks) it saves a lot of work. And Optonaut is such a long-term project. They are working on it for quite a while now, so I am sure the quality is pretty high. I am very curious if the Kickstarter campaign works as well as they hope and I cannot wait for the first people to share their optographs from amazing places! Future of Optonaut The Optonaut team plans to build a sharing site where you can show others amazing places. They want to completely redesign the App. I guess the stitching algorithm is something where you can put endless effort in. It is an optimization problem where it is not completely clear what to optimize, so I guess this will continually be improved. I want it! What do I need? You need an Android / iOS smartphone. There seems to be a web-based viewer which works with Chrome/Firefox/Safari, too.

It is a gravity-powered lamp designed as an alternative for off-grid families who would otherwise use kersene lamps. It is basically only a 12kg weight, lifted and put on the gravity light. When the weight goes down again it pulls a cord. This cord makes an electric motor which generates electricity for LEDs. If you lift the weight 1.83m, the light lasts for about 20 minutes. I wondered how much weight I would need to lift (assuming 100% efficiency) to power my computer for 8 hours. According to the power supply unit, my laptop can consume up to 65 Watt. That is astonishingly low. I think my big one is at about 600-800 Watt. \\begin{align} 65 W \\cdot 8 h &= \\frac{65 kg \\cdot m&#94;2 \\cdot 8h \\cdot 60 \\frac{min}{h} \\cdot 60 \\frac{s}{min}}{s&#94;3}\\\\ &= 1872 \\cdot 10&#94;3 \\frac{kg \\cdot m&#94;2}{s&#94;2} \\end{align} You might also remember from your physics courses that potential energy is \\(E_{pot} = m \\cdot g \\cdot h\\) where \\(m\\) is the mass (in kg), \\(g = 9.80 \\frac{m}{s&#94;2}\\) is the gravitational acceleration and \\(h\\) is the height in meters. \\begin{align} m \\cdot h &= \\frac{E_{pot}}{g}\\\\ &= \\frac{1.872 \\cdot 10&#94;6 \\frac{kg \\cdot m&#94;2}{s&#94;2}}{9.80 \\frac{m}{s&#94;2}}\\\\ &= 191.0 \\cdot 10&#94;3 kg \\cdot m \\end{align} This means I would have to lift 191 000 packages one liter of milk to a height of 1 meter. Every day. Just to let my small laptop run. Or lets view it from another angle. I think lifting about 5 packages of milk to a height of about 1.8m each hour would not be too exhausting. This would generate about \\(E_{pot} = 5kg \\cdot 1.80m \\cdot 9.80 \\frac{m}{s&#94;2} / (1h \\cdot 60 \\frac{min}{h} \\cdot 60 \\frac{s}{min}) = 0.0245 \\frac{kg \\cdot m&#94;2}{s&#94;3} = 0.0245 W\\) .

One common example is a very simple weather model: Either it is a rainy day (R) or a sunny day (S). On sunny days you have a probability of 0.8 that the next day will be sunny, too. On rainy days you have a probability of 0.6 that the next day will be rainy, too. As you have only two possible weather conditions, the probability that it changes from sunny do rainy is 0.2 and vice versa it is 0.4. You can visualize this with a graph like this: Simple Markov chain weather model I am taking a course about markov chains this semester. Today, we've learned a bit how to use R (a programming language) to do very basic tasks. R vs Python The following will show some R code and then some Python code for the same basic tasks. As an example, I'll use reproduction. The states are \\(S_1 = \\{AA, AA\\}\\) , \\(S_2 = \\{AA, Aa\\}\\) , \\(S_3 = \\{AA, aa\\}\\) , \\(S_4=\\{Aa,Aa\\}\\) , \\(S_5 = \\{Aa, aa\\}\\) and \\(S_6 = \\{aa, aa\\}\\) . The idea is that each pair of parents give birth to two children. The parents \\(S_2 = \\{AA, Aa\\}\\) can give birth to {{AA, AA}, {AA, Aa}, {Aa, Aa}}. This results in the following state transition matrix. $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1/4 & 1/2 & 0 & 1/4 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 1/16 & 1/4 & 1/8 & 1/4 & 1/4 & 1/16\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/4 & 1/2 & 1/4\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$$ The rows mean from which state you start, the colums are the states you can get to. Now, how would you define this matrix with R? P = matrix ( c ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 2 , 0 , 1 / 4 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 / 16 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 8 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 16 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 4 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ), byrow = TRUE , nrow = 6 ) And this is how you do it with Python: You first need to install numpy . This is very easy with Linux ( sudo apt-get install python-numpy ), but I've heard it is not that easy with Windows systems. import numpy as np P = np . matrix ([[ 1. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. ], [ 1. / 4 , 1. / 2 , 0. , 1. / 4 , 0. , 0. ], [ 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. , 0. , 0. ], [ 1. / 16 , 1. / 4 , 1. / 8 , 1. / 4 , 1. / 4 , 1. / 16 ], [ 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. / 4 , 1. / 2 , 1. / 4 ], [ 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 1. ]]) A common matrix operation is taking the \\(n\\) -th power. This is how you do it with R: First, install the library \"expm\" by executing install.packages(\"expm\") . Then library ( \"expm\" ) n = 5 Pn = P %&#94;% n and this is the Python way: n = 5 Pn = P ** n Visualizing data is a very important tool.

Er dient als Prüfungsvorbereitung. Ich habe die Vorlesungen bei Herrn Prof. Dr. Marius Zöllner im Sommersemester 2015 gehört. Es gibt auch einen Artikel zu Machine Learning 1 . Behandelter Stoff Einführung Slides: 01_Einfu__hrung_MLII.pdf Rückblick auf ML 1 . MLNN steht übrigens für Multi-Layer Neural Network . Semi-Supervised Learning Slides: 02_Semi-supervised-learning.pdf Überwachtes Lernen (engl. Supervised Learning ) Alle Trainingsdaten liegen mit Labels vor. Unüberwachtes Lernen (engl. Unsupervised Learning ) Alle Trainingsdaten liegen ohne Labels vor. Semi-Supervised Learning ( SSL ) Die meisten Trainingsdaten liegen ohne Labels vor, jedoch gibt es für jede Klasse auch gelabelte Daten. Self-Learning ( Self-Training , Self-Labeling , Decision-directed learning ) Self-Training ist ein Algorithmus zum Semi-supervised Learning. Er geht wie folgt vor: Trainiere mit gelabelten Daten. Werte ungelabelte Daten aus. Füge Daten, bei denen sich der Klassifizierer sicher ist, zu den Trainingsdaten hinzu. Zurück zu Schritt 1. Dabei sind folgende Variationen vorstellbar: Füge alle Daten hinzu. Füge nur Daten hinzu, bei denen sich der Klassifizierer sicher ist. Gewichte Daten mit der Sicherheit. Co-Training ( Mit-Lernen ) Co-Training ist ein Algorithmus zum Semi-supervised Learning. Er geht wie folgt vor: Splitte jeden Feature-Vektor auf die gleiche Art in zwei Feature-Vektoren mit disjunkten Features auf. Trainiere zwei unterschiedliche Klassifizierer auf den beiden unterschiedlichen Feature-Mengen der gelabelten Daten. Label mit den beiden Klassifizieren die ungelabelten Daten. Füge ungelabelte Daten dem Trainingsdatensatz (also den gelabelten Daten) hinzu, falls die Klassifizierer für diese eine hohe Konfidenz aufweisen. Zurück zu Schritt 2. Dabei sind folgende Variationen vorstellbar: Demokratisches Voting: Bei mehr als 2 Klassifizierern. Schwellwert: Nur hinzufügen, wenn alle Klassifizierer jeweils eine Schwelle überschreiten. Gewichtes Voting: Alle Klassifizierer zusammen müssen eine Schwelle überschreiten. Low Density Separation Methoden, welche Low Density separation benutze versuchen die Entscheidungsgrenze in eine Region niedriger Dichte zu legen. Ein Beispiel ist die Transductive SVM . Weiteres: Hier könnte ich mir gut vorstellen, dass man eine Bachelor / Master-Arbeit macht. Man könnte sich große gelabelte Datensätze suchen, einen gewissen Teil der Labels weglassen (also einige Trainingsdaten als \"ungelabelt\" behandeln) und die verschiedenen SSL -Methoden untersuchen. Bis zu 20% gelabelte Daten hoch wäre es interessant; also z.B. (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% gelabelte Daten). Mit mehr gelabelten Daten könnte man argumentieren, dass man es sich vermutlich leisten könnte auch den Rest noch zu labeln. Siehe Folie 28-31. SSL and Active Learning Slides: 03_Semi-supervised+Active-learning.pdf Lagrange-Multiplikator Lagrange-Multiplikatoren sind ein Verfahren der Optimierungstheorie. Sie werden genutzt, wenn ein Optimierungsproblem mit Nebenbedingungen vorliegt. Durch sie kann die Nebenbedingung eliminiert werden. Active Learning ( Aktives Lernen ) Die Lernmaschine wählt die zu lernenden Daten selbst aus. Verfahren: Query Synthesis Selective Sampling Pool-Based Active Learning Query-by-Committee Query Synthesis (siehe Active Learning Literature Survey ) Der Lerner kann Feature-Vektoren (Querys) de novo , also von Grund auf neu / selbst erzeugen. Er kann für diesen neuen Query ein Orakel befragen, was das Label ist. Selective Sampling (Selektive Entnahme, siehe Selective sampling and active learning from single and multiple teachers ) Selective Sampling ist eine Methode des aktiven Lernens. Dabei wird jede Runde $t$ dem Lerner ein Feature-Vektor $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n$ präsentiert. Der Lerner muss sich jede Runde entscheiden, ob er einen Preis bezahlt um das Label zu sehen. Der Lerner hat also zwei Ziele, die miteinander in Konflikt stehen: Er will alles richtig klassifizieren, aber zugleich die Kosten so niedrig wie möglich halten. Pool-Based Active Learning Pool-Based Active Learning ist eine Methode des aktiven Lernens. Dabei wird von einem Pool an ungelabelten Daten $\\mathcal{U}$ ausgegangen und einem deutlich kleineren Pool $\\mathcal{L}$ an gelabelten Daten. Queries werden aus $\\mathcal{U}$ gezogen. Dabei wird ganz $\\mathcal{U}$ evaluiert und für den hilfreichsten Feature-Vektor $x \\in \\mathcal{U}$ nach einem Label gefragt. Hinge-Funktion $$f(x) = \\max(x, 0)$$ Query-by-Committee ( QBC ) Es wird ein Committee $\\mathcal{C}$ an Klassifikatoren trainiert, welches gemeinsam (z.B. durch majority vote) eine Klassifikation trifft. Allgemeiner Ansatz: Trainiere eine Menge $\\mathcal{C}$ an Klassifikatoren Wähle neue Daten, wenn die Hypothesen Wiedersprüchlich sind Selektive Entnahme: Beobachte neue Instanz $x$ und werte diese mit $\\mathcal{C}$ aus Frage das Label ab, falls es einen Wiederspruch in den Hypothesen von $\\mathcal{C}$ für $x$ gibt. Neu trainiren, zurück zu 1 Pool-based Active Learning: Messung des Wiederspruchs der Hypothesen für alle Instanzen $x$ Ranking (z.B. Entropie) Abfrage der Labels für die $k$ widersprüchlichsten Instanzen Neu trainiren, zurück zu 1 Weiteres: Ausreißerproblem: Ausreißer sollten im QBC nicht genommen werden. Dazu könnte die Dichte im Datenraum gemessen werden.

University of California, Berkeley. This expalins TD-learning. Markov Decision Process ( MDP ) Ein Markovscher Entscheidungsprozess ist ein 5-Tupel $(S, A, T, r, p_0)$, wobei $S$ eine endliche Zustandsmenge, $A$ eine endliche Menge von Aktionen, $T_a(s, s') = T(s_{t+1}=s'|s_t = s, a_t = a)$ die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu einem beliebigen Zeitpunkt von Zustand $s$ mit der Aktion $a$ in den Zustand $a'$ zu kommen (engl. Transition), $r_a(s, s')$ ist die Belohnung (Reward), die man direkt erhält wenn man erhält wenn man von Zustand $s$ mit Aktion $a$ in Zustand $s'$ kommt, $p_0$ ist die Startverteilung auf die Zustände $S$ Partially observable Markov decision process ( POMDP ) Ein partially observable Markov decision process ist ein 7-tupel $S, A, T, R, \\Omega, O, \\gamma$ , wobei $S$ die Zustandsmenge, $A$ die Aktionsmenge, $T: S \\times A \\times S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ die probabilisitische Zustandsübergangsfunktion (transition function) ist, $R: S \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ die Reward-Funktion, $\\Omega$ die Menge der möglichen Beobachtungen, $O$ die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Beobachtungen, gegeben ein Zustand und eine Aktion und $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ der Diskontierungsfaktor ist. Options Eine Option ist wohl-definiertes Verhalten, welches im hierarchischen RL eingesetzt werden kann. Es ist ein Baustein für komplexe Pläne. Options werden in Semi-MDPs eingesetzt und ersetzen dort die Aktionen. Hierarchien Abstrakter Maschinen ( HAM ) Ein MDP wird mit Maschinen $\\{M_i\\}$ kombiniert. Jede Maschine repräsentiert einen Teil der Policy. Jede Maschine verwendet eigene Zustände $m_t&#94;i$ und globale Zustände $s_t$. Maschinen werden durch Zustandsautomaten abgebildet. MaxQ-Dekomposition (siehe [ Die00 ]) Das zu lösende MDP $M$ wird als Menge von Unteraufgaben $\\{M_0, \\dots, M_n\\}$ interpretiert. Dabei ist $M_0$ das Haupt-MDP. TODO. Folie 35: NODO: Was heißt hier \"mit festen Knoten\"? Dynamische Bayessche Netze Slides: 05_DynamischeBayesscheNetze.pdf Multiplikationssatz Seien $A, B, X_i$ Ereignisse. Dann gilt: $$P(X_1, \\dots, X_n) = P(X_1) \\cdot \\prod_{k=2}&#94;n P(X_k | X_{k-1}, \\dots, X_1)$$ und insbesondere $$P(A\\cap B) = P(A, B) = P(A\\mid B) \\cdot P(B)$$ Gesetz der totalen Wahrscheinlichkeit Seien $A_1, \\dots, A_n$ paarweise disjunkte Ereignisse mit $A = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n A_i$. Dann gilt für jedes beliebige Ereignis $B$: $$P(B) = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n P(B | A_i) \\cdot P(A_i) = P(A_i, B)$$ Satz von Bayes Seinen $A, B$ Ereignisse mit $P(B) > 0$. Dann gilt $$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$ Hierbei heißt $P(A|B)$ die a posteriori Wahrscheinlichkeit , $P(B|A)$ die likelihood , $P(A)$ die a priori Verteilung über $A$ und $P(B)$ die a priori Verteilung über $B$ . Bayessches Netz (Siehe Lecture 13: Bayes Nets ) Ein Bayessches Netz ist ein DAG , bei dem die Knoten Zufallsvariablen und die Kanten bedingte Abhängigkeiten beschreiben. Bayessche Netze sind zur Modellierung kausaler Zusammenhänge geeignet. Markov Random Field Siehe ML 1 Dynamisches Bayessches Netz Dynamische Bayessche Netze sind Bayessche Netze zur Beschreibung dynamischer Prozesse. Markov Blanket Sei $G=(V,E)$ ein DAG zu einem Bayesschen Netz und $v_S \\in V$. Dann ist der Markov Blanket die folgende Knotenmenge $B \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{v_S\\}$: Die Elternknoten von $v_S$ sind in $B$. Die Kindknoten $K = \\{v_{K_1}, \\dots, v_{K_n}\\}$ sind in $B$ Die Elternknoten von $K$, ausgenommen von $v_S$, sind in $B$ Diese Knotenmenge macht $v_S$ unabhängig von anderen Knoten. Naive Bayes Spam Filter Ein naiver Bayes Spamfilter nutzt häufig Bag-of-Words Features. Man berechnet die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine gegebene E-Mail Spam ist. Dazu geht man davon aus, dass die Wörter in einer E-Mail unabhängig von einander sind und nutzt den Satz von Bayes. Siehe Bayes-Klassifikator für eine detailiertere Beschreibung. Bayes Filter Ein Bayes Filter ist eine Familie von Zufallsvariablen. Das könnte z.B. die $(x,y,z)$ Position eines GPS-Sensors sein. Diese Position ist verrauscht. Nun gibt es drei mögliche Anfragen: Filtern : Es liegen Messungen $Z_0, \\dots, Z_t$ vor, sage die aktuelle Position $X_t$ vorher. Also filtere das Rauschen aus $Z_t$ unter berücksichtigung, dass wir uns noch nicht teleportieren können: $$P(X_t | Z_t, \\dots, Z_0)$$ Prädizieren : Es liegen Messungen $Z_0, \\dots, Z_t$ vor, sage die Position $X_{t+k}$ vorher: $$P(X_{t+k} | Z_t, \\dots, Z_0)$$ Glätten : Es liegen Messungen $Z_0, \\dots, Z_t$ vor, sage die Position $P(X_{t-k} | Z_t, \\dots, Z_0)$ vorher. Beispiele für Bayes-Filter sind Kalman-Filter HMM Partikel Filter Naiver Bayes'scher Spam Filter Ein probabilistischer Klassifikator welcher die Unabhängigkeit der Features vorraussetzt wird naiv genannt. Der naive bayessche Spam Filter nutzt Bayes Theorem um die Wahrscheinlichkeit zu berechnen, dass eine E-Mail Spam ist. Kalman-Filter Der Kalman-Filter ist ein Bayes-Filter. Er wird z.B. zum Schätzen einer Fahrzeugtrajektorie eingesetzt. Der Kalman-Filter besteht aus zwei Schritten: Predict the next step of the system given the previous measurements. Update the estimate of the current state given the measurement of this time step. Siehe Kalman-Filter Artikel für Details. Expectation Maximizaion Algorithm ( EM-Algorithmus ) Der EM-Algorithmus ist ein Clusteringalgorithmus mit weicher Clusterzugehörigkeit. Er findet die Parameter für gegebene Verteilungen (üblicherweise multivariate Normalverteilungen). Er löst das Henne-Ei Problem Wenn man weiß wie genau die Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen der Cluster parametrisiert sind ist es leicht die Daten den Clustern zuzuordnen. Wenn man die Daten einem Cluster zuordnen kann, dann ist es leicht die Parameter der Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung zu schätzen. Wenn man sowohl Clusterzugehörigkeit als auch die Parameter der Verteilung schätzen muss ist es schwer. Man kann \"zufällig\" die initialen Parameter wählen, dann die Zuordnung machen. Der EM-Algorithmus iteriert nach der initialisierung der Parameter: Expectation : Schätze für jeden Datenpunkte die Clusterzugehörigkeit. Maximization : Parameter der Cluster neu berechnen. Also für jeden Cluster $A$ $\\mu_A = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N w_{i, A} \\cdot x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N w_{i, A}}$ $\\sigma_A&#94;2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N w_{i,A} (x_i + \\mu_A)&#94;2}{\\sum_{i=1}&#94;N w_{i,A}}$ wobei $w_{i,A}$ die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Zugehörigkeit des Punktes $i$ zu Cluster $A$ ist. Der EM-Algorithmus ist mit $k$-means verwandt. Siehe Mixture Models 1: the EM algorithm Typische Fragestellungen: Gegeben ist die Struktur eines Bayesschen Netzes: Wie lautet die Verteilung? Dies wird üblicherweise mit dem EM -Algorithmus gelöst. Anwendungsfälle: Automatische Diagnose, gegeben die Symptome (Bayessches Netz) Fahrzeugverfolgung: Vorhersage von Routen, welche die Fahrzeuge nehmen werden (Dynamisches Bayessches Netz) Anmerkungen: Die Folien sind hier sehr gut! Insbesondere Folie 14-23 sollte man sich ansehen. Es scheint folgende Beziehung zu gelten: HMMs, Kalman-Filter, Extended Kalman-Filter, Partikel Filter sind Beispiele für Bayes-Filter. Bayes-Filter sind Beispiele für dynamische Bayessche Netze.

Die komplexen Attribute beschreiben funktionale Beziehungen zwischen Klassen. Dieses Modell wurde in libDAI umgesetzt. Gaussche Prozesse Slides: 07_Gaussche_Prozesse.pdf I suggest reading the first two chapters of the online book gaussianprocess.org before starting to read the slides. See also: Function Approximation The Talking Machines: OpenAI and Gaussian Processes Lineare Regression Die lineare Regression ist ein Modell zur approximation von Datenpunkten $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\times \\mathbb{R}$ durch eine lineare Funktion, d.h. einer Funktion der Form $f(x) = x&#94;T \\cdot w$. Dabei ist $w \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n$. Wenn man als Optimierungskriterium den quadratischen Abstand $$E(f, data) = \\sum_{(x,y) \\in data} (f(x) - y)&#94;2$$ nimmt, dann ist eine optimale Lösung durch $$w = (X&#94;T X)&#94;{-1} X&#94;T y$$ gegeben. Siehe auch: Proof of when is $A=X&#94;T X$ invertible? sowie Does a transformation + linear regression give the same regression as fitting a quadratic function? Affine Regression Die affine Regression ist ein Modell zur approximation von Datenpunkten $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n \\times \\mathbb{R}$ durch eine affine Funktion, d.h. einer Funktion der Form $f(x) = x&#94;T \\cdot w + b$. Dabei ist $w \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Um das Problem auf ein lineares zu reduzieren kann man den Feature-Vektor $x$ durch ein konstantes Feature $x_0 = 1$ erweitern. Korrelationskoeffizient Der Korrelationskoeffizient $\\kappa(X, Y) \\in [-1, 1]$ ist ein Maß für den linearen Zusammenhang zwischen zwei Zufallsvariablen $X, Y$. Er ist definiert als $$\\kappa(X, Y) := \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\\sigma(X) \\cdot \\sigma(Y)}$$ Gausscher Prozess ( Kriging , Machine learning - Introduction to Gaussian processes by Nando De Freitas) Gaussche Prozesse approximieren eine Funktion dadurch, dass sie an jedem Punkt eine Normalverteilung (Gauss-Verteilung) annehmen.

Deep Belief Netz ( DBN ) Ein Deep Belief Netz ist ein gerichtetes, azyklisches, probabilistisches graphisches Modell. Restricted Boltzmann machine ( RBM ) Siehe Neuronale Netze Contrastive Divergence ( CD , CD-$k$ ) Siehe Neuronale Netze Contrastive Wake-Sleep Algorithm (siehe The wake-sleep algorithm von Hinton - Lecture 13d aus \" Neural Networks for Machine Learning \") Der Wake-Sleep Algorithmus ist ein Trainingsalgorithmus für gerichtete graphische Modelle wie Sigmoid Belief Networks. Er ist nicht für RBMs. Man hat im Grunde zwei Netzwerke mit der gleichen Topologie, jedoch ist die Richtung vertauscht: Das eine Netz stellt die Hypothese aus den Daten auf, das andere Netz geniert neue Daten aus einer gegebenen Hypothese. In der wake phase wird die Eingabe genutzt um die Hypothese zu erzeugen. In dieser Phase werden die Gewichte für das Generative Modell trainiert. Dieses soll die Aktivierung der vorhergehenden Schicht rekonstruieren. In der sleep phase wird das generative Modell genutzt um aus dem Modell samples zu erzeugen. Dann trainiert man die Gewichte des erkennenden Netzes (also vergleichbar mit der wake phase, nur anders rum). Siehe A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets Probleme von Tiefen Netzen und wie man sie lösen kann: Lange Trainingsdauer : GPUs / mehr Rechenpower / weniger Parameter durch Parameter sharing, z.B. in CNNs / TDNNs Extrem viele gelabelte Trainingsdaten werden benötigt : Internet (z.B.

(Topics: RBMs) Convolutional Neural Networks Slides: 09_ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks.pdf Siehe auch: Neuronale Netze Vorlesung Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) CNNs sind neuronale Netze welche weight sharing einsetzen. Sie setzen eine diskrete Faltung um. Ein CNN muss mindestens einen Convolutional Layer haben. Dieser hat folgende Parameter: Padding: None, Zero, Copy Stride: $s \\in \\mathbb{N}_{> 0}$ Filter Size: $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{N}&#94;2$ Number of filters: How many filters should get learned? Feature Map Nach einem Convolutional Layer hat man die Ausgabe der Filter, welche auf die Eingabe angewandt wurden. Diese nennt man Feature Map . Für jeden Filter bekommt man eine Feature Map. Die Feature Maps sind wiederum Eingaben für die nächsten Schichten. Pooling Layer Ein pooling layer ist eine Schicht in einem CNN, welche Features zusammenfasst. Pooling Schichten haben folgende Parameter: Größe: Typischerweise $3 \\times 3$ Stride $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$: Typischerweise gleich der Größe des Pooling-Bereichs (also 3). Art: max, mean Typischerweise reduziert sie die Anzahl der Features, da typischerweise ein $s > 1$ gewählt wird. Spiking Neural Nets Slides: 10_SpikingNeuralNets.pdf Spiking Neural Networks Gepulste neuronale Netze versuchen natürliche neuronen realistisch abzubilden. Das Hodgkin-Huxley Neuronenmodell wurde bereits 1952 vorgestellt. Hodgkin-Huxley Neuronenmodell Das Hodgkin-Huxley Neuronenmodell modelliert die elektrochemischen Vorgänge innerhalb eines Neurons mit elektrischen Baugliedern. Dies resultiert in Differenzialgleichungen mit 4 Variablen (Kapazität der Membran, Widerstände der Ionenkanäle, Gleichgewichtspotentiale, Öffnung der Ionenkanäle). Das Modell ist realistisch, aber sehr komplex. LIF Neuronenmodell (Leaky integrate and Fire) Das LIF Neuronenmodell modelliert ein Neuron durch eine gewöhnliche Differentialgleichung erster Ordnung. SRM Neuronenmodell (Spike Response Model) Das SRM Neuronenmodell modelliert die Refraktionszeit. Das ist die Zeit, in der kein neues Aktionspotential aufgebaut werden kann. Das SRM ist ein rein phänomenologisches Modell, welches trotz der Einfachheit allgemeiner ist als das LIF-Modell. Evaluation Slides: 11_Evaluation.pdf Für Klassifikation: Konfusionsmatrix Eine Konfusionsmatrix ist eine Tabelle, in welcher die Spalten angeben, welche Hypothese gemacht wurde (Testentscheid) und die Zeilen den wahren Wert angeben. So kann für beliebig viele Klassen gezeigt werden, wie gut der Klassifikator ist und welche Art der Verwechslung er macht. Klassifikationsfehler $\\text{Klassifikationsfehler} = \\frac{\\text{Fehlerhafte Hypothesen}}{\\text{Anzahl aller Beispiele}} \\in [0, 1]$ Klassifikationsgüte Klassifikationsgüte = 1 - Klassifikationsfehler False Alarm Rate ( FA , Falsch Positiv Rate , FPR ) Es sei FP die Anzahl der False Positive Testdaten, also der Testdaten für welche Positive vorhergesagt wurde, die aber negative sind. Weiter sei TN die Anzahl der True Negatives, also der Testdaten, für welche korrekterweise negative vorhergesagt wurde. Dann ist die FPR definiert als $$\\text{FPR} := \\frac{FP}{FP + TN} \\in [0, 1]$$ Die FPR gibt also den Anteil an, wie viele der tatsächlich negativen fälschlicherweise als positiv erkannt wurden. Miss-Rate ( MR , Falsch Negativ Rate , FNR ) $$FNR := \\frac{FN}{TP + FN} \\in [0, 1]$$ Recall ( True Positive Rate , TPR , Sensitivität ) $$TPR = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = 1 - FNR \\in [0, 1]$$ Der Recall gibt den Anteil der erkannten positiven aus allen positiven an. Sensitivität ist ein in der Medizin üblicher Begriff. Precision ( Genauigkeit ) $$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\in [0, 1]$$ Die Precision gibt den Anteil der real positiven aus den als positiv erkannten an. ROC-Graph ( Receiver-Operator Curve ) Der ROC-Graph gibt für einen Klassifikator, bei dem man einen Parameter einstellen kann, den Fehler an. Die $x$-Achse ist dabei die FPR, die $y$-Achse die TPR. Spezifität Der Begriff der Spezifität ist in der Medizin üblich und ist definiert durch $$Spezifität = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = 1 - FPR$$ Es ist eine Art recall für die negative Klasse. Im Beispiel eines medizinischen Tests wäre das der Anteil der Gesunden, bei denen tatsächlich auch die Diagnose \"Gesund\" gestellt wurde. PRC-Graph ( Precision-Recall-Graph ) Die $x$-Achse ist Recall, die $y$-Achse ist Precision. F-Maß $$F_\\alpha = \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\alpha&#94;2 \\cdot precision + recall}$$ Alternative: Aufstellen einer Kostenfunktion und optimieren nach Kosten. Plotten der Anzahl der Trainingsdaten ( \\(x\\) -Achse) und des Fehlers ( \\(y\\) -Achse). Die Kurven sollten der Test-Fehler sowie der Trainingsfehler sein. Damit lässt sich abschätzen, ob mehr Trainingsdaten ohne eine Veränderung des Modells hilfreich sind. Für Regression Mittlerer Quadratischer Fehler ( MSE , Mean Squared Error ) $$E(f, data) = \\frac{1}{|data|} \\sum_{(x, y) \\in data} (f(x) - y)&#94;2$$ Relativer Quadratischer Fehler $$E(f, data) = \\frac{\\sum_{(x, y) \\in data} (f(x) - y)&#94;2}{\\sum_{(x,y) \\in data} (y - \\mu)&#94;2}$$ Mittlerer Absoluter Fehler $$E(f, data) = \\frac{1}{|data|} \\sum_{(x, y) \\in data} |f(x) - y|$$ Siehe auch Beurteilung eines binären Klassifikators False positives and false negatives Matt Zeiler: Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks on YouTube, 2015. 48 minutes. Prüfungsfragen Was versteht man unter einer \"Transductive SVM\"? → Eine Transductive SVM ist eine SVM welche neben gelabelten Daten auch noch ungelabelte benutzt. Sie versucht die Trennebene durch eine Region geringer Dichte zu legen. Wie lautet die Optimierungsformel der transductive SVM? → $$\\text{minimize}_{w, b, y&#94;*} \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|&#94;2$$ unter den Nebenbedingungen $$\\forall i \\in 1, \\dots, n: y_i (w \\cdot x_i - b) \\geq 1$$ und $$\\forall j \\in 1, \\dots, k: y_j&#94;* (w \\cdot x_j&#94;* -b) \\geq 1\\text{ with }y_j&#94;* \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$$ Dabei sind $D&#94;* = \\{x_i&#94;* | i = 1, \\dots, k\\}$ ungelabelte Daten. Was macht man im Reinforcement Learning, wenn Aktionen länger dauern? → Options verwenden (TODO: Wie ändert sich die Value Iteration Formel nun bzgl. der Zeit?) Warum heißen POMDPs \"Partially Observable\"? → Weil der Agent zwar Feedback über die Umgebung bekommt, aber nicht direkt erfährt in welchem Zustand er ist. Siehe Definition . Welche Active Learning Techniken gibt es? → Query / Selective / Pool-based (vgl. Query-by-Committee ) Wie nennt man ein instanziiertes OPRM? → TODO (Skelett?) Wie funktioniert aktives Lernen bei SVMs? → Bei SVMs gibt es die Dualität zwischen dem Feature-Space und dem Hypothesenraum. In dem Feature-Space stellen die Achsen $x_i$ die Features dar, Trainingsdaten Punkte sind und die SVM durch die Trennebene visualisiert wird. Im Hypothesenraum sind die Achsen $w_i$ zusammen der Normalenvektor der SVM, die verschiedenen Trennebenen der SVMs sind hier Punkte. Die Daten geben Bedingungen an die SVM vor, welche in diesem Raum als Hyperebenen dargestellt werden können. Der Margin ist in diesem Raum ein Kreis, der die Bedingungs-Hyperebenen berührt. Beim aktiven lernen versucht man den Version-Space im Inneren der Bedungungs-Hyperebenen so schnell zu verkleinern wie möglich. Was versteht man unter Transduktivem Lernen? → Unter Transduktiver Inferenz versteht man das Schließen von Trainingsbeispielen direkt auf auf spezifische Testfälle. Wie nennt man die Wahrscheinlichkeit des aktiellen Zustands in POMDPs? → Belief.

Entscheidungsbäume, Grammatiken; Lernen nach Vapnik, VC-Dimension, Kreuzvalidierung und Leave-One-Out, Boosting Folien ME-Kap1_V31.pdf Einleitendes Kapitel welches erklärt, was Klassifikation ist. Beispiele für Klassifikation: Blumen/Schmetterlinge in Arten; Schrauben in Schraubentypen; Schüttgut in Mineralien, Pflanzen, Glasscheiben, Diamante, ... Formalismen Domäne \\(\\Omega \\subseteq\\) Welt, Elemente der Domäne heißen Objekte, Objekte werden in paarweise disjunkte Äquivalenzklassen \\(\\omega_i\\) gruppiert, sodass jedes Objekt genau eine Äquivalenzklasse hat. Man beobachtet / misst Eigenschaften realer Objekte. Dies kann als Funktion m aufgefasst werden, die von der Domäne in den Merkmalsraum abbildet. Optimalerweise ist diese Abbildung injektiv, bei ungünstig gewählten Merkmalen jedoch nicht. Klassifikatoren arbeiten auf dem Merkmalsraum und finden eine Partition des Merkmalsraumes in Klassen Muster : Gesamtheit der beobachteten / gemessenen Werte einer einzelnen Stichprobe (eines einzelnen Objekts). Erkennung : (Wieder)erkennung von etwas, was bereits bekannt ist. Merkmale : eruirbare, charakteristische Eigenschaften, die als Basis für die Untersuchung von Mustern dienen soll. Mustererkennungsschritte : Sensierung ergibt Muster; Vorverarbeitung; Segmentierung; Merkmalsextraktion ergibt Merkmale; Klassifikation ergibt Äquivalenzklassen Überwachtes lernen : Vorklassifizierte Beispiele sowie die Klassenstruktur sind gegeben; eventuell auch Auftrittswahrscheinlichkeiten \\(P(\\omega_i)\\) der Klassen Gesamtstichprobe wird in die disjunkten Mengen Lernstrichprobe, Validierungsstichprobe und Teststichprobe zerlegt.

Er kann auf vorhandene Strukturen analysiert werden, indem er auf einen 2- oder 3-dimensionalen unterraum projeziert wird. Dies kann bei einfachen Projektionen jedoch nicht erfolgreich sein, wenn beispielsweise zwei Klassen Schalenförmig um den Urspruch angeordnet sind. Um Stichproben im Merkmalsraum zu vergleichen können Metriken benutzt werden. Eine Metrik ist eine Abbildung \\(d(m_1, m_2)\\) , für die gilt: Positive Definitheit: \\(d(m_1, m_2) \\geq 0\\) und \\(d(m_1, m_2) = 0 \\Leftrightarrow m_1 = m_2\\) , Symmetrie: \\(d(m_1, m_2) = d(m_2, m_1)\\) , Dreiecksungleichung: \\(d(m_1, m_2) \\leq d(m_1, m_3) + d(m_3, m_2)\\) Metriken können durch Normen erzeugt werden, indem \\(d(m_1, m_2) := \\|m_1 - m_2\\|\\) definiert wird. Eine Norm ist eine Abbildung \\(\\| \\cdot \\|: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_0&#94;+, x \\mapsto \\|x\\|\\) für die gilt: Definitheit: \\(\\|x\\| = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\\) Absolute Homogenität: \\(\\|\\alpha \\cdot x \\| = \\alpha \\cdot \\| x \\|\\) Dreiecksungleichung: \\(\\|x+y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|\\) Typische Normen sind die euklidische Norm und die Mahalanobis Norm \\(\\|m\\| := \\sqrt{m&#94;T A m}\\) mit \\(A\\) positiv definit. Hauptkomponentenanalyse (HKA, engl. PCA) Finde \\(m_0\\) , sodass \\(J_0(m) := \\sum_{k=1}&#94;N \\|m - m_k\\|&#94;2\\) minimal ist, also \\(m_0 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}&#94;N m_k\\) Finde Gerade \\(h: m = \\bar{m} + ae\\) , welche die Punkte optimal repräsentiert.

Ergibt: \\(a_k = e&#94;T (m_k - \\bar{m})\\) Berechnung des optimalen Richtungsvektors Streumatrix \\(S := \\sum_{k=1}&#94;N (m_k - \\bar{m}) (m_k - \\bar{m})&#94;T\\) Finden eines affinen \\(d'\\) -dimensionalen Unterraumes des Merkmalsraumes, welcher die Daten \\(D\\) mit minimalen quadratischem Fehler repräsentiert. Siehe gist für eine kurze Python-Implementierung. Keine Garantie für die Korrektheit! Kernelized PCA Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) ME-Kap3_V52.pdf Bayessche Klassifikatoren wählen die Klasse aus, die die größte Wahrscheinlichkeit besitzt. Dazu verfolgt man den Ansatz $$P(\\omega|m) = \\frac{p(m|\\omega) \\cdot P(\\omega)}{p(m)}$$ Dabei wird \\(P(\\omega|m)\\) die A Posteriori Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung und \\(P(\\omega)\\) die A Priori Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung genannt. ME-Kap4_V33.pdf Parameterschätzung kann entweder mit der Likelihood-Methodik oder mit der Bayesschen Methodik durchgeführt werden. Die Idee der Likelihood-Methodik ist es, den Parameter \\(\\theta\\) als unbekannte konstante (d.h. nicht-stochastische) Größe anzusehen. Man wählt \\(\\theta\\) also so, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Beobachtungen gegeben \\(\\theta\\) maximiert wird. Die Bayessche Methodik geht dagegen davon aus, dass \\(\\theta\\) auch eine Zufallsvariable ist und über eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung beschrieben werden kann. Schätzer können verschiedene Qualitätskriterien erfüllen, z.B. Erwartungstreue oder Konsistenz . Bei der Parameterschätzung können folgende Fehler passieren: Bayesscher Fehler: (TODO: Was ist das?) Modellfehler: Unpassendes Modell gewählt (Falsche Verteilungsannahme?) Schätzfehler: Zu wenige Daten um Parameter korrekt zu bestimmen ME-Kap5_V31.pdf Parameterfreie Methoden heißen \"parameterfrei\", weil sie keine konkrete Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung parametrisieren und den Parameter schätzen. Die Parameterfreien Methoden können sehr wohl Parameter benutzen. Beispiele sind: Parzen Window Nächste Nachbarn ME-Kap6_V18.pdf Allgemeine Problemstellungen : Dimension des Merkmalsraumes Overfitting ME-Kap7_V54.pdf Spezielle Klassifikatoren : Lineare Diskriminanzfunktionen: Linear bezieht sich hier auf die Kombination der Merkmale.

Unterschiedliche Einheiten (→ Entdimensionalisieren) Unterschiedliche Skalen (→ Teilen durch Varianz oder durch Wertebereich) Unterschiedliche Wertebereiche (→ Durchschnitt abziehen) Wie funktioniert MDA? → Sie maximiert \\(J(w) = \\frac{|m'_1 - m'_2|&#94;2}{{s'}_1&#94;2 - {s'}_2&#94;2}\\) (im 2-Klassen Fall, wobei \\(w\\) die Ebene ist, auf die projeziert wird) Wie unterscheidet sich PCA/MDA von dem suboptimalen Algorithmus zur Merkmalsauswahl? → PCA/MDA sind Klassifikatorunabhängig, aber der suboptimale Algorithmus benötigt bereits einen Klassifikator. Wie lautet die Fundamentalformel der Bayesschen Klassifikation? → \\(P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)\\, P(B | A)}{P(B)}\\) (wobei üblicherweise B das Merkmal ist und A die Klasse) Wie lautet die Hauptformel der PCA? \\(m' = A&#94;T \\cdot (m - \\bar{m})\\) , wobei \\(A\\) die Basiswechselmatrix ist.

Kernfunktion \\(K\\) als transformierten Merkmalsraum \\(\\Phi\\) . Dabei müssen die transformierten Merkmale nicht explizit berechnet werden und der Klassifikator hat trotz der hohen Dimension von \\(\\Phi\\) nur eine niedrige Zahl von freien Parametern (Kernel-Trick). (E) Relaxation der Forderung nach linearer Trennbarkeit durch Einführung von Schlupfvariablen (slack variables).

Naiver Bayes-Klassifikator Ein Klassifizierer heißt naiver Bayes-Klassifikator, wenn er den Satz von Bayes unter der naiven Annahme der Unabhängigkeit der Features benutzt. Normalverteilung Eine stetige Zufallsvariable $X$ mit der Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichte $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, gegeben durch $f(x) = \\frac {1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e&#94;{-\\frac {1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)&#94;2}$ heißt $\\mathcal N\\left(\\mu, \\sigma&#94;2\\right)$-verteilt, normalverteilt mit den Erwartungswert $\\mu$ und Varianz $\\sigma&#94;2$. Multivariate Normalverteilung Eine $p$-dimensionale reelle Zufallsvariable $X$ ist normalverteilt mit Erwartungswertvektor $\\mu$ und (positiv definiter) Kovarianzmatrix $\\Sigma$, wenn sie eine Dichtefunktion der Form $$f_X(x)=\\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{(2\\pi)&#94;p \\det(\\Sigma)} } \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\mu)&#94;{T}\\Sigma&#94;{-1}(x-\\mu) \\right)$$ besitzt.

Principal Component Analysis ( PCA , Hauptkomponentenanalyse ) Die Hauptkomponentenanalyse ist ein Verfahren zur Dimensionalitätsreduktion von ungelabelten Daten im $\\mathbb{R}&#94;n$. Sie projeziert die Daten auf diejenige Hyperebene im $\\mathbb{R}&#94;d$, die den durch die Projektion stattfindenden Datenverlust minimal hält. Dabei ist $d \\in 1, \\dots, n$ beliebig wählbar. Die Transformation der Daten $X$ findet durch eine Matrixmultiplikation $Y = P \\cdot X$ statt. Die Matrix $P$ besteht aus den ersten $d$ Eigenvektoren der Kovarianzmatrix der Features $X$: $P = (v_1, \\dots, v_d)$ mit $\\lambda_j v_j = C_X v_j$ für $j=1,\\dots,d$ Außerdem gilt: $C_X = \\frac{1}{n-1} X X&#94;T$ V03: LVQ Slide name: V03_2015-04-21_LVQ.pdf k-Means Fuzzy k-Means Vector Quantization (VQ) is an unsupervised clustering algorithm Learning Vector Quantization is supervised. V04: Perceptron Slide name: V04_2015-04-28_Perceptron.pdf McCulloch–Pitts (MCP) Neuron Ein MLP-Neuron is ein Algorithmus zur binären Klassifizierung. Er hat $m+1$, mit $m \\in \\mathbb{N}_{> 0}$ inputs $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Davon ist der erste (nullte) Konstant gleich Eins und wird Bias genannt. Jeder Input wird mit eingem Gewicht $w_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ multipliziert, alle gewichteten Inputs werden addiert und schließlich wird die Stufenfunktion $\\varphi(x) = \\begin{cases}1 &\\text{falls } x > 0\\\\0 &\\text{sonst} \\end{cases}$ angewendet. Man lernt mit MCP Neuronen, indem man $$\\Delta w = \\eta \\delta x$$ $$w \\gets w + \\Delta w$$ berechnet, wobei $\\eta \\in (0, 1)$ die Lernrate ist, $x$ ein Trainingsdatum und $\\delta = y_{\\text{target}} - y$ die Abweichung vom gewünschten Ergebnis ist. Diese Regel wird auch Perceptron Learning Rule genannt. Rosenblatt-Perzeptron Wie das McCulloch–Pitts (MCP) Neuron, nur ist $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ und ein Lernalgorithmus ist gegeben. Dieser addiert den $\\eta \\in (0, 1)$ gewichteten, fehlklassifizierten Vektor auf die Gewichte $w_i$. $\\eta$ heißt die Lernrate . Man lernt mit MCP Neuronen, indem man $$\\Delta w = \\eta \\delta x$$ $$w \\gets w + \\Delta w$$ berechnet, wobei $\\eta \\in (0, 1)$ die Lernrate ist, $x$ ein Trainingsdatum und $\\delta = - \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w}$ der Gradient auf der Fehleroberfläche in Abhängigkeit von den Gewichten ist. Es wird also Gradient descent verwendet. Pocket Perceptron Algorithm Ein Lernalgorithmus für ein Rosenblatt-Perzeptron.

Multilayer Perceptron A Multilayer Perceptron is a special type of Feed Forward Neural Network. It consists of fully connected layers only. Figure 1: Draft of multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The bias units are grey, the input units are red, the hidden units are green and the output unit is blue. The edges are directed from input, to hidden, to output and from the bias to hidden / output. Metrik Sei $X$ eine Menge und $d:X \\times X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ eine Abbildung. $d$ heißt Metrik auf $X$, wenn gilt: $d(x, y) = 0 \\geq x=y \\;\\;\\; \\forall x, y \\in X$ $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$ $d(x,y) \\leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)$ Jaccard-Metrik Es seien $A, B$ Mengen und $J(A, B) := \\frac{|A \\cup B| - |A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$. Dann heißt $J$ die Jaccard-Metrik. Levenshtein-Distanz Es seien $a, b$ Zeichenketten, $|a|$ die Länge der Zeichenkette $a$ und $\\delta_{a_i \\neq b_j}$ genau dann 1, wenn das $i$-te Zeichen von $a$ und das $j$-te Zeichen von $b$ sich unterscheiden. Dann heißt $d_L(a, b)$ die Levenshtein-Distanz: $$d_L(a,b) := lev_{a,b}(|a|, |b|)$$ $$\\text{lev}_{a,b}(i, j) = \\begin{cases}\\max(i,j) &\\text{falls} \\min(i,j) = 0,\\\\ \\min \\begin{cases}\\text{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j)+1\\\\ \\text{lev}_{a,b}(i,j-1)+1\\\\ \\text{lev}_{a,b}(i-1,j-1)+\\delta_{(a_i \\neq b_j)}\\\\\\end{cases} &\\text{sonst}\\end{cases}$$ Fragen: Welche Feed Forward Neuronalen Netze existieren, die keine Multilayer Perceptronen sind? → CNNs, TDNNs, SOMs. Welche Skalentypen gibt es für Merkmale (Features)? Nominale Merkmale: Nur Gleichheit kann überprüft werden Ordinale Merkmale: Es existiert eine \"kleiner gleich\"-Relation Intervallskalierte Merkmale: Die Differenz der Merkmale hat eine Semantik Es existiert jedoch kein \"wirklicher\" Nullpunkt Verhältnisskalierte Merkmale: Wie Intervallskaliert, aber mit absolutem Nullpunkt.

Stochastic Gradient Descent Batch Gradient Descent V07: Feature Learning Slide name: V07_12-05-2015_Feature_Learning.pdf Autoencoder Ein Autoencoder ist ein neuronales Netz, welches darauf trainiert wird die Input-Daten am Output wieder zu replizieren. Bottleneck Features Unter Bottleneck-Features versteht man eine Schicht in einem neuronalem Netz, welche wesentlich kleiner ist als die vorhergehende und nachfolgende Schicht. Kullback-Leibler-Divergenz Die Kullback-Leibler-Divergenz ist ein Maß für die Unterschiedlichkeit zweier Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen $P, Q$. Für diskrete Verteilungen ist sie definiert als: $$KL(P||Q) := \\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) \\cdot \\log \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$ Denoising Autoencoder Ein Autoencoder, welcher trainiert wird rauschen zu entfernen. Fakten: Eine lineare Aktivierungsfunktion wird in einer Repräsentation im Bottleneck-Feature resultieren, die PCA ähnelt. Fehlerfunktion: CE bei binären Ausgaben (d.h.

Hyperparameter Hyperparameter $\\theta$ eines neuronalen Netzes sind Parameter, welche nicht gelernt werden. Learning Rate Scheduling Start with a learning rate $\\eta$ and reduce it while training. Exponential Decay Learning Rate $\\eta_t = \\eta_{t-1} \\cdot \\alpha = \\eta_0 \\cdot \\alpha&#94;t$ mit $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ Performance Scheduling Measure the error on the cross validation set and decrease the learning rate when the algorithm stops improving. RProp RProp is a learning rate scheduling method which is only based on the sign of the gradient. It increases the learning rate when the sign of the gradient doesn't change and decreases or resets it when the sign of the gradient changes. Rprop has an own learning rate for every single feature. AdaGrad (vgl. Folie 34) $$\\eta_{tij} = \\frac{\\eta_0}{\\sqrt{1 + \\sum_k {(\\frac{\\partial E&#94;{t-k}}{\\partial w_{ij}})}&#94;2}}$$ where $\\eta_0$ is an initial learning rate, $t$ is the epoch, $i,j$ refer to neurons. Newbob Scheduling Newbob scheduling is a combination of exponential decay learning rate scheduling and performance scheduling. It starts with a learning rate $\\eta_0$. When the validation error stops decreasing, switch to exponentially decaying learning rate. Terminate when the validation error stops decreasing again.

Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) Feed-Forward Neuronale Netze, welche durch geteilte Gewichte (weight sharing) grafische Filter lernen. CNNs sind aktuell in der Computer Vission Stand der Technik. Time-Delay Neural Networks ( TDNNs ) TDNNs wenden wie CNNs weight sharing an um Filter zu lernen. Sie werden in der ASR verwendet und lernen auch Filter. Allerdings wird hier über die Zeit hinweg gefaltet. Multi-State Time-Delay Neural Networks ( MS-TDNNs , siehe [ Haf92 ]) MS-TDNNs codieren die alignment-Suche im Netzwerk. Sie sind hybride Netze (so wie HMM-DeepNN Hybrids von Mircosoft).

Siehe auch: Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning V10: SOM Slide name: V10_2015-05-26_SOM.pdf Hebbsche Lernregel what fires together, wires together Selbstorganisierende Karten ( SOM , Kohonennetze ) SOMs sind eine Art von Neuronalen Netzen. Die neuronen von SOMs sind auf einem Gitter angeordnet. Es gibt nur zwei Schichten: Die Input-Neuronen und die Neuronen auf dem Gitter. Jedes Input-Neuron ist mit jedem Neuron auf dem Gitter verbunden. Figure 2: Draft of self-organizing map (SOM). Training: Initialisierung : Die Gewichte $w_{ji}$ von dem $i$ -ten Input-Neuron zum Neuron ( $i = 1, ..., n$ ) $j$ auf dem Gitter werden zufällig initialisiert. Sampling : Nehme ein zufälliges Beispiel $x$ der Trainingsdaten. Matching : Finde das Neuron $j_{\\text{min}}$ , für das die Gewichte dem Input am ähnlichsten sind: $$j_{\\text{min}} = \\text{arg min}_j \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (x_i - w_{ji})&#94;2$$ Update : Passe die Gewichte des gewinnenden Neurons $i$ sowie der Nachbarschaft $j$ an: $w_j = w_j + \\eta h(j, i(x))(x - w)$ Repeat : Und zurück zu Schritt 2.

Kohonen's Self Organizing Feature Maps by ai-junkie V11: RBMs Slide name: V11_2015-05-27_RBMs Hopfield-Netz (siehe [ Hop82 ], [ Kri05 ]) Ein Hopfield-Netz besteht nur aus einer Schicht von McCulloch-Pitts Neuronen. Jedes Neuron ist mit jedem anderen Neuron (also nicht sich selbst) und allen Inputs verbunden. Die Schicht funktioniert gleichzeitig als Ein- und Ausgabeschicht. Hopfield-Netze werden in einem einzigen durchgang Trainiert. Dabei wird auf das Gewicht von Neuron $i$ zu Neuron $j$ + 1 addiert, wenn das Bit $i$ des Trainingsmusters gleich ist. Falls das nicht der Fall ist, wird von dem Gewicht 1 subtrahiert: $$w_{ij} = \\sum_{p} (2 a&#94;{(i)}_p - 1) \\cdot (2 a&#94;{(j)}_p - 1)$$ Jedes Gewicht ist zum start des Trainings 0. Das Training ist also einfach nur ein Zählen, wie häufig die Stellen übereinstimmen. Figure 3: Draft of Hopfield network. Every node is an input node. The McCullogh-Pitts nodes are updated asynchronously. When the state of the node doesn't change any more, they contain the output of the network. Learned are the weights between the nodes. Boltzmann-Maschine Boltzmann-Maschinen sind stochastische neuronale Netzwerke, welche duch belibige ungerichtete Graphen repräsentiert werden können. Die neuronen sind binär; sie feuern also entweder oder nicht. Es gibt insbesondere keine Unterschiede in der Stärke mit der sie feuern. Siehe auch: Scholarpedia Restricted Boltzmann machine ( RBM ) Eine RBM ist ein neuronales Netz mit nur einem Hidden Layer. Es ist gleichzeitig ein Spezialfall von MRFs . Im Gegensatz zur Boltzmann-Maschine muss die Restricted Boltzmann-Machine (RBM) aus einem bipartitem Graph bestehen. Dies erlaubt ein effizienteres Trainingsverfahren (Contrastive Divergence). Die Energie des Netzwerkes ist $$- \\sum_{i < j} w_{ij} s_i s_j - \\sum_i b_i s_i$$ wobei $s_i, s_j$ die binären Zustände der Knoten $i, j$ sind. Der Name \"Boltzmann\" kommt von dieser Energie (man kann den Netzwerkzuständen wahrscheinlichkeiten zuweisen, die direkt Proportional zu $e&#94;{-E}$) sind. Figure 4: Draft of an RBM. The learned parameters are red. Es werden keine Verbindungen zwischen den Hidden Units erlaubt (daher das \"restricted\" - Quelle: Hinton, 2015 ). Siehe A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines von Hinton, 2010. sowie Interence in RBMs Contrastive Divergence ( CD , CD-$k$ , siehe YouTube Video , 2 von Hugo Larochelle) Contrastive Divergence ist ein Trainingsalgorithmus für RBMs. Ein Hyperparameter ist $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Er geht wie folgt vor: Lege den Trainingsvektor $x&#94;{(t)}$ an die Eingabeknoten an. Berechne die Wahrscheinlichkeit für jede Hidden Unit, dass diese gleich 1 ist. Setze sie mit dieser Wahrscheinlichkeit gleich 1. Berechne die Wahrscheinlichkeit für jeden Eingabeknoten, dass dieser gleich 1 ist. Setze ihn mit dieser Wahrscheinlichkeit gleich 1. Gehe zu Schritt 2. Wiederhole dies für $k$ Schritte (dies wird auch Gibbs-Sampling genannt). Das, was nach dem $k$-fachem Gibbs-Sampling in der Eingabeschicht steht wird auch \"negative sample $\\tilde x$\" genannt. Update der Parameter: \\begin{align} W &\\leftarrow W + \\eta (h(x&#94;{(t)}) {x&#94;{(t)}}&#94;T - h(\\tilde x) {\\tilde x}&#94;T)\\\\ b_h &\\leftarrow b_h + \\eta (h(x&#94;{(t)}) - h(\\tilde x))\\\\ b_v &\\leftarrow b_v + \\eta (x&#94;{(t)} - \\tilde x) \\end{align} wobei $\\eta \\in (0, 1) $ die Lernrate ist, $b_h \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n_h$ der Bias-Vektor der Hidden Units und $b_v \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n_v}$ der Bias-Vektor der Eingabeknoten ist. $h = \\text{sigmoid}(b_h + W x)$ ist ein Vektor, welcher für die einzelnen Hidden Units sagt wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass diese gleich 1 sind. In der Praxis funktioniert es schon mit $k=1$ für Pre-Training. Wenn $k$ groß ist konvergiert $\\tilde x$ gegen den wahren Modellwert. Das wäre dann eine Monte-Carlo Estimation. Simulated annealing Simulated annealing ist ein heuristisches Optimierungsverfahren. Sei $D$ ein Wertebereich einer Funktion $f: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ und $U: D \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(D)$ eine Funktion, welche die Umgebung eines Punktes angibt. Sei $T: \\mathbb{N}_0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ die Temperatur zum Zeitpunkt $t \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$. Gesucht ist $\\text{arg min}_{x \\in D} f(x)$. Wähle zum Zeitpunkt $t=0$ einen zufälligen Startwert $x \\in D$. Gehe nun iterativ vor und jeweils einen Zeitschritt weiter: Nehme einen Punkt aus der Umgebung $y \\in U(x)$. Wenn $f(y) \\leq f(x)$, dann überschreibe $x \\leftarrow y$. Falls nicht, dann überschreibe es mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit $\\exp \\left (-\\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{T(t)} \\right )$. Speichere in jedem Schritt den bisher besten Wert. Anwendungen: Hopfield-Netze: Hopfield-Netze kann man für das TSP einsetzen und auch als Assoziativspeicher nutzen. Allerdings haben sich Hopfield-Netze nie wirklich durchgesetzt. RBMs: Collaborative Filtering Siehe auch: Deeplearning.net: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) A. Barra, A. Bernacchia, E.

Jordan-Netz Ein rekurrentes neuronales Netzwerk, bei dem die Ausgabe der Ausgabeschicht im nächsten Zeitschritt als Eingabe verwendet wird. Backpropagation through Time ( BPTT ) Ein Trainingsalgorithmus für rekurrente neuronale Netze, bei dem das Netz \"ausgerollt\" wird. Das rekurrente Netz wird also als unendlich großes nicht-rekurrentes Netz behandelt. Vanishing gradient problem Das Problem des verschwindenden Gradienten ist eine Herausforderung im Kontext neuronaler Netze, welche mit Backpropagation trainiert werden. Insbesondere bei sehr tiefen oder rekurrenten Netzen kann es passieren, dass der Gradient bei den ersten Schichten sehr niedrig ist, sodass das Netz sehr langsam lernt. Aufgrund numerischer Ungenauigkeit kann dies sogar dazu führen, dass das Netz in den ersten Schichten nicht lernen kann. Long short-term memory ( LSTM ) Ein LSTM ist ein Typ eines neuronalen Netzwerks. Das besondere an LSTM Netzen sind \"intelligente\" Neuronen, welche über Gates bestimmen ob ein Wert gespeichert wird und wie lange.

Reddit: The Idea of LSTMs V13: NN learning tricks Slide name: V13_2015-06-09_NNlearning-tricks.pdf Momentum In der Update-Regel $\\Delta w_{ij}&#94;* (t+1) = \\Delta w_{ij} (t+1) + \\alpha \\Delta w_{ij}(t)$ wird der Term $\\Delta w_{ij}(t)$ als Momentum bezeichnet. Der Skalar $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ gewichtet diesen und ist ein Hyperparameter. Siehe auch: Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent Quickprop Quickprop ist ein Trainingsverfahren für neuronale Netze. Der Lernalgorithmus nimmt an, dass die Fehlerebene lokal durch eine parabel approximiert werden kann. Das Gewichtsupdate im Schritt $k$ ist demnach vom Gradienten und dem Gewichtsupdate das vorherigen Schrittes abhängig: $$\\Delta&#94;{(k)} \\, w_{ij} = \\Delta&#94;{(k-1)} \\, w_{ij} \\left ( \\frac{\\nabla_{ij} \\, E&#94;{(k)}}{\\nabla_{ij} \\, E&#94;{(k-1)} - \\nabla_{ij} \\, E&#94;{(k)}} \\right)$$ Weight Decay Passe die Fehlerfunktion an: $E = MSE + \\lambda \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij}&#94;2$ Weight Elimination Passe die Fehlerfunktion an: $E = MSE + \\lambda \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{w_{ij}&#94;2}{1+w_{ij}&#94;2}$ Optimal Brain Damage ( OBD ) Optimal Brain Damage entfernt nach dem Training Verbindungen die sehr kleine $|w_{ij}|$ haben. Besser: Entferne Verbindungen, die geringen Einfluss auf die Fehlerfunktion haben. Cascade Correlation (siehe Fahlman und Lebiere: The Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture ) Cascade Correlation ist ein konstruktiver Algorithmus zum erzeugen von Feed-Forward Neuronalen Netzen. Diese haben eine andere Architektur als typische multilayer Perceptrons. Bei Netzen, welche durch Cascade Correlation aufgebaut werden, ist jede Hidden Unit mit den Input-Neuronen verbunden, mit den Output-Neuronen und mit allen Hidden Units in der Schicht zuvor. Siehe How exactly does adding a new unit work in Cascade Correlation? Meiosis Netzwerke (siehe Stephen Jose Hanson: Meiosis Networks ) Meiosis Netzwerke bauen ein neuronales Netz auf. Sie beginnen mit einer einzelnen hidden Unit. Diese hidden Unit wird aufgespalten, wenn die \"Unsicherheit\" zu groß ist (vgl. paper für Kritierum; vgl. summary ). Automatic Structure Optimization ( ASO , siehe [ Bod93 ]) Der ASO-Algorithmus passt folgende Hyperparameter im Training automatisch an: Anzahl der Hidden Units Größe des Input-Fensers (ASR-Spezifisch) Anzahl der Zustände, welche \"Accoustic Events\" repräsentieren Classification Figure of Merit ( CFM , siehe [ Ham90 ]) $$E_{CFM}(w) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + e&#94;{-\\beta \\Delta_k + \\gamma}}$$ wobei $k$: Klasse $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$: Hyperparameter $\\Delta_k = o_t - o_k$: Differenz des wahren (true) nodes und des anderen Knotens.

Texton (siehe UCLA ) Unter einem Texton versteht man grundlegende, kleine Features eines Bildes. Diese Bilden die kleinsten als unterschiedlich wahrnehmbaren Einheiten. Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) Ein CNN ist ein Neuronales Netzwerk, welches mindestens eine Schicht hat, welche die Parameter eines Kernels für eine Faltung lernt. Feature Map Im Kontext von CNNs versteht man unter einer Feature-Map die Ausgabe eines Kernels in einem Convolutional Layer.

Dabei ist mir folgendes aufgefallen: Im Innenren von Neuronen wird die Aktivierungsfunktion \"geplottet\". Das heißt bei der Sigmoidfunktion wird etwas S-Förmiges dargestellt, bei der sign-Funktion etwas eckiges, bei ReLU ein horizontaler Strich gefolgt von einem Strich im 45-Grad Winkel. Typischerweise ist der Input links (oder alternativ unten) und der Output rechts (oder alternativ oben) Interpretation of errors Figure 5: Training and Testing error over epochs. At some point overfitting happens. Figure 6: Training and Testing error over training data. At some point overfitting happens.

The nice thing about Lasagne is that it is possible to write Python code and execute the training on nVidea GPUs with automatically generated CUDA code. However, installing Lasagne is not that easy. Especially if you are not familiar with Python. This article aims to guide you through the installation process. Python Ubuntu-based systems will have Python installed, but I'm not too sure about pip. You can get it with $ sudo apt-get install python-pip Make sure you have Python and pip , the standard Python package installer. Type the following commands to check if you have both: $ python --version Python 2 .7.8 $ pip --version pip 6 .1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages ( python 2 .7 ) sklearn sklearn is a nice package for machine learning. You can install it with $ pip install scikit-learn (When I write commands like this you either have to execute sudo pip install scikit-learn or pip install scikit-learn --user ). This should work without problems. Each classifier has a fit method and a predict method. See iris example to get a feeling how to use it. It provides a lot of useful functions like train_test_split and has an awesome documentation. You don't need this for Lasagne, but it might be good to use sklearn and Lasagne in combination. Graphics drivers and CUDA Make sure CUDA runs on your system by the following commands. If it doesn't run, you could try the following guides: Installing and testing CUDA in Ubuntu 14.04 Installing CUDA Toolkit 6.5 on Ubuntu 14.04 Linux NVIDIA CUDA Getting Started Guide for Linux Run $ nvidia-smi -L GPU 0 : GeForce GTX TITAN Black ( UUID: GPU-abcdef12-abcd-1234-1234-01234567890a ) $ nvcc --version nvcc: NVIDIA ( R ) Cuda compiler driver Copyright ( c ) 2005 -2013 NVIDIA Corporation Built on Thu_Mar_13_11:58:58_PDT_2014 Cuda compilation tools, release 6 .0, V6.0.1 $ nvidia-smi -a ============== NVSMI LOG ============== Timestamp : Fri Apr 17 18 :44:41 2015 Driver Version : 331 .79 Attached GPUs : 1 GPU 0000 :01:00.0 Product Name : GeForce GTX TITAN Black Display Mode : N/A Display Active : N/A Persistence Mode : Disabled Accounting Mode : N/A Accounting Mode Buffer Size : N/A Driver Model Current : N/A Pending : N/A Serial Number : N/A GPU UUID : GPU-fcff168f-a045-2f95-7a4f-8e1cf26a24eb Minor Number : 0 VBIOS Version : 80 .80.4E.00.01 Inforom Version Image Version : N/A OEM Object : N/A ECC Object : N/A Power Management Object : N/A GPU Operation Mode Current : N/A Pending : N/A PCI Bus : 0x01 Device : 0x00 Domain : 0x0000 Device Id : 0x100C10DE Bus Id : 0000 :01:00.0 Sub System Id : 0x106610DE GPU Link Info PCIe Generation Max : N/A Current : N/A Link Width Max : N/A Current : N/A Bridge Chip Type : N/A Firmware : N/A Fan Speed : 26 % Performance State : N/A Clocks Throttle Reasons : N/A FB Memory Usage Total : 6143 MiB Used : 39 MiB Free : 6104 MiB BAR1 Memory Usage Total : N/A Used : N/A Free : N/A Compute Mode : Default Utilization Gpu : N/A Memory : N/A Ecc Mode Current : N/A Pending : N/A ECC Errors Volatile Single Bit Device Memory : N/A Register File : N/A L1 Cache : N/A L2 Cache : N/A Texture Memory : N/A Total : N/A Double Bit Device Memory : N/A Register File : N/A L1 Cache : N/A L2 Cache : N/A Texture Memory : N/A Total : N/A Aggregate Single Bit Device Memory : N/A Register File : N/A L1 Cache : N/A L2 Cache : N/A Texture Memory : N/A Total : N/A Double Bit Device Memory : N/A Register File : N/A L1 Cache : N/A L2 Cache : N/A Texture Memory : N/A Total : N/A Retired Pages Single Bit ECC : N/A Double Bit ECC : N/A Pending : N/A Temperature Gpu : 29 C Power Readings Power Management : N/A Power Draw : N/A Power Limit : N/A Default Power Limit : N/A Enforced Power Limit : N/A Min Power Limit : N/A Max Power Limit : N/A Clocks Graphics : N/A SM : N/A Memory : N/A Applications Clocks Graphics : N/A Memory : N/A Default Applications Clocks Graphics : N/A Memory : N/A Max Clocks Graphics : N/A SM : N/A Memory : N/A Compute Processes : N/A to see if CUDA was installed correctly. Theano The installation of Theano is a bit tricky (see official page ). I don't remember if I installed additional packages, but try $ sudo -H pip install theano Make sure that your ~/.theanorc exists and looks like this: [global] device=gpu floatX=float32 Note that float32 is required, even if you have a 64bit system. To test your installation, save the following as theanotest.py and execute it with python theanotest.py : #!/usr/bin/env python from theano import function , config , shared , sandbox import theano.tensor as T import numpy import time vlen = 10 * 30 * 768 # 10 x #cores x # threads per core iters = 1000 rng = numpy . random . RandomState ( 22 ) x = shared ( numpy . asarray ( rng . rand ( vlen ), config . floatX )) f = function ([], T . exp ( x )) print f . maker . fgraph . toposort () t0 = time . time () for i in xrange ( iters ): r = f () t1 = time . time () print 'Looping %d times took' % iters , t1 - t0 , 'seconds' print 'Result is' , r if numpy . any ([ isinstance ( x . op , T . Elemwise ) for x in f . maker . fgraph . toposort ()]): print ( 'Used the cpu' ) else : print ( 'Used the gpu' ) It should print the following (well, something similar): Using gpu device 0: GeForce GTX TITAN Black [GpuElemwise{exp,no_inplace}(<CudaNdarrayType(float32, vector)>), HostFromGpu(GpuElemwise{exp,no_inplace}.0)] Looping 1000 times took 0.38205909729 seconds Result is [ 1.23178029 1.61879349 1.52278066 ..., 2.20771813 2.29967761 1.62323296] Used the gpu Especially \"used the gpu\" is important. Theano code work on both, CPU and GPU. If you have a GPU and it does not currently work on a task and it is configured correctly, then Theano should automatically use the GPU. (Don't try to run two Theano scripts at a time ... weird things could happen.) Lasagne Lasagne is hosted at Github: https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne Currently, it is not on pip as Sander wants to wait until we get to version 1.0. So you have to install it manually: $ git clone https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne.git $ cd Lasagne Lasagne$ sudo -H python setup.py install Now you can test if it worked by executing the MNIST example in Lasagne ( MNIST is a huge digit dataset). This might first take some time to download, but should then run quite fast. If your machine does not use the GPU it will take ages (e.g. on my laptop it takes about a minute for one epoch) Lasagne/examples$ python mnist.py Loading data...

Noch ist nichts da (Stand: 24.09.2015) Einsicht : wird über Ilias bekannt gegeben Erlaubte Hilfsmittel : Keine Fazit Dieses Modul kann man sich getrost schenken. Wenn man vorher nichts von Regelungstechnik weiß, ist man hinterher auch nicht schlauer. Es scheint so zu sein, dass die klausurrelevanten Teile alle in den Übungen besprochen werden. Die bereitgestellten Materialien hätten besser sein können. Es gibt zwar ein Skript welches sogar eine ISBN-Nummer hat, aber insbesondere bei dem Regelungstechnik-Teil ist es nicht sonderlich hilfreich. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass mir da einfach Grundlagen fehlen. Diese werden auch nicht erklärt. Zu den PDF-Folien muss man sagen, dass diese zwar schnell im Ilias hochgeladen wurden, aber teilweise zu viele Informationen hatten. Es war nicht klar, was wichtig ist. Außerdem hat teilweise, wenn man nur die Folien angesehen hat, der Kontext gefehlt. Ein Highlight waren Videos, in denen Roboter Kugeln auf einem Tablett sehr schnell transportieren. Dazu müssen die Roboter das Tablett im richtigen Winkel neigen. Das war ein Highlight der Vorlesung. Schade, dass nie erklärt wurde wie so etwas berechnet wird. Vorwissen in der Regelungstechnik und bei Differentialgleichungen ist sicher hilfreich. Die Klausurvorbereitung besteht hauptsächlich aus Auswendiglernen. Verständnis ist wohl nicht nötig (mal schauen... ich konnte keinen Notenschlüssel finden.), da die Klausuren immer nahezu identisch aufgebaut sind. Meine Empfehlung an Studenten ist, in die Übung zu gehen. Da kommen die klausurrelevanten Sachen. Teilweise 1-zu-1 die gleichen Fragen. Verbesserungsvorschläge für die Dozenten hätte ich auch ein paar: Es sollte Tutorien geben. Es sollte einen verpflichtenden Übungsschein geben. Mit 50% der Punkte hat man den Übungsschein, ab 75% gibts Bonuspunkte für die Klausur. Diese Übungsblätter werden von den Tutoren korrigiert und besprochen. Wenn die Studenten es reihenweise nicht schaffen merkt man schon, wo man die Vorlesung verbessern muss. Veröffentlichung der Musterlösungen zu den Klausuren. Anpassung des Skripts, z.B. wurde der VME-Bus durch den PCIe-Bus ersetzt. Anpassung des Modulhandbuchs. Man sollte den Leuten empfehlen , zuvor die Vorlesung \"Betriebssysteme\" gehört zu haben. Ein Wikibook beginnen. Wenn man das für jedes Modul machen würde, könnte man auch Abhängigkeiten besser sehen und Studenten könnten fehlendes Wissen leichter nachholen. Außerdem würde man das Wissen frei verfügbar machen und man könnte die Exzellenz der Lehre zeigen, falls man wirklich der Meinung ist die Lehre am KIT sei exzellent. Über die Diskussionsseiten könnten Studenten und andere weitgehend anonym ihre Fragen stellen und Verbesserungsvorschläge machen. Über das Wiki-System könnten freiwillige Helfer insbesondere bei zeitaufwendigen Grafiken helfen.","tags":"German posts","title":"Echtzeitsysteme - Klausur"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/markovsche-ketten-klausur/","text":"Dieser Artikel beschäftigt sich mit der Vorlesung „Markovsche Ketten\" am KIT.

What they seem to forget or don't know is that you can call C code from Python with ctypes . So you can get almost as fast as you can get with C; you're not limited by the language in that respect. And most of the time your code has other issues when it is too slow. Now, you can also wrap Rust code with ctypes for Python ☺ Motivation As a very simple example, I prepared a dumb Fibonacci implementation written in Python: def fib ( n ): \"\"\"Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.\"\"\" if n <= 1 : return n else : return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) if __name__ == '__main__' : n = 37 print ( \"The %i th Fibonacci number is %i .\" % ( n , fib ( n ))) and exactly the same for Rust pub extern fn fib ( n : u32 ) -> u32 { if n <= 1 { return n ; } else { return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ); } } fn main () { let n = 37 ; println ! ( \"The {0}th Fibonacci number is {1}.\" , n , fib ( n )) } The execution times are quite different. Rust needs 0.40 seconds while Python 3 needs 15.7 seconds. That is almost 40× the time of Rust! Wouldn't it be great if we could call the Rust function from Python? Example I'll explain in the next chapters what is done, but at first you should see that there are only minor changes / overhead: fibonacci.rt : #![crate_type = \"dylib\" ] #[no_mangle] pub extern fn fib ( n : u32 ) -> u32 { if n <= 1 { return n ; } else { return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ); } } Call rustc -O fibonacci.rt to generate the library. Python: #!/usr/bin/env python import ctypes fiblib = ctypes . CDLL ( \"./libfibonacci.so\" ) fib = fiblib . fib n = 37 print ( \"The %ith Fibonacci number is %i.\" % ( n , fib ( n ))) Now, taking the Python code, it takes only 0.44 seconds! What happens The line #![crate_type = \"dylib\"] tells rustc that it has to create a dynamic library. The line #[no_mangle] tells the compiler not to mangle the name fib . This is important so that we can later use it from Python. (I think names are mangled to prevent name clashes ... so it's a kind of name-spacing.) Then we load the C DLL with ctypes.CDLL(\"./libfibonacci.so\") and use it as expected. Pretty easy, isn't it? Caveats Python makes some things very simple which are not that simple at all. Think about numbers, for example. In Rust, you have integers with 64 bits. But in Python you have arbitrary length integers. This might lead to problems.

The designers wanted it to be similar fast, give the programmer similar fine-grained control over memory management, but more safety. Rust does so by introducing the concept of ownership , borrowing and lifetimes of variables. Rust also makes sure that after the scope is finished, the memory of variables gets de-allocated. I think FFI is interesting. It allows Rust to \"talk\" with C code. Rust 1.0 was just released ( source ). This means the language should be stable. If you want to know more, you should take a look at the beautiful A 30-minute Introduction to Rust . Syntax Example fn fib ( n : u32 ) -> u32 { if n <= 1 { return n ; } else { return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ); } } fn main () { let n = 36 ; println ! ( \"The {0}th Fibonacci number is {1}.\" , n , fib ( n )) } Video introduction Comparison benchmarksgame shows that rust is similar fast as C++. For some games it is faster, for some slower. Sometimes it needs less code, sometimes more. stackoverflow has only 1781 questions of which are 102 unanswered (5.7%). C++ has 356,824 questions and 55,172 questions are not answered (15.5%). But I guess that will change as soon as more people use Rust (and libraries written in Rust). GitHub : Wow, Rust seems to be growing fast!

I am usually not a fan of new languages (e.g. I don't see a reason to use Go , Swift ... not to speak of Clojure , Julia , TypeScript , Dart ). Most of the time, I don't see anything new which is better than in existing languages and almost always the material around (tools, libraries, community) is much worse than in existing solutions.

On Debian based systems you will get the information which type of encoding it has like this: $ file test.txt test.txt: UTF-8 Unicode text This is probably the best result. But to make sure that we know how to deal with other encodings, you can change the encoding like this: $ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-1 test.txt > test-iso-8859-1.txt $ file test-iso-8859-1.txt test-iso-8859-1.txt: ISO-8859 text Source code encoding A first important step is to define the source code encoding. This is done with a comment. The first lines of Python code should probably always look like this: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- PEP-0263 explains it. Printing encoding problems The following error occurs when you try to print non-UTF-8 stuff with Python via Sublime Text: [Decode error - output not utf-8] The same code, executed via ZSH, gives: Die s��e, kleine, l�rmende �berfliegerin lebt in der Haute-C�te-Nord.

Here are some minimalistic code examples for beginners. Reading A very common way to handle the contents of a file is by reading the file completely and then working with a single big string. The only reason not to do so is because your file is too big. For your information, this is how long reading a file takes (all times are in seconds, reading is executed 100 times): file size min max median average --------------------------------------------------- 10 KiB 0.0000 0.0008 0.0000 0.0002 100 KiB 0.0000 0.0009 0.0001 0.0002 1 MiB 0.0003 0.0013 0.0005 0.0006 10 MiB 0.0041 0.0079 0.0047 0.0049 100 MiB 0.0627 0.0778 0.0655 0.0663 As you can see, reading files is quite fast. However, I would recommend the start thinking if reading the complete file is appropriate when the file size exceeds 100 MiB as you might get different problems then. For example, the content of the file might not fit in your main memory (typically 4GiB, type cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal to get how much main memory your computer has). See source code for details how I measured it. Completely with open ( 'filename.txt' ) as f : content = f . read () is all you need to read a text file completely in a Python string variable content . You could, for example, split the whole string to a list of lines: lines = content . split ( ' \\n ' ) Line by line You can read a text file line by line, but keep in mind that this will still have the endline character \\n in each line ! with open ( 'filename.txt' ) as f : for line in f : print ( line ) Writing To open files, you have to specify a mode. This is either reading, writing or appending (binary or text data). If you don't specify it, the default value is reading. So for writing you have to specify it: with open ( 'filename.txt' , 'w' ) as f : f . write ( \"Hello world!\" ) Python 3 Python 3 has some new features which are very nice to have. To get them in Python 2, you have to add from __future__ import print_function at the beginning of your code before other imports happen. Now you can print to files: from __future__ import print_function with open ( 'file.txt' , 'w' ) as f : print ( \"Hello World!\" , file = f ) The print function has also a \"end\" parameter which defaults to \\n . This means it adds \\n automatically at the end of each printed line. You might not want that e.g. in a Windows environment where it should be \\r\\n . with You might wonder what with does. My advice for newbees would be not to worry too much about it, it is just the way you juse I/O with Python. If you come from the C / C++ world, you might know that you have to close files when you opened them. The with statement makes sure that the file is closed when the block is finished.

With Python, of course ☺ Here is the program: #!/usr/bin/env python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy.random def main (): # Generate Data n = 10000 numbers_a = numpy . random . uniform ( size = samples ) numbers_b = numpy . random . uniform ( size = samples ) numbers_c = numpy . random . uniform ( size = samples ) numbers_max = [ max ( a , b , c ) for a , b , c in zip ( numbers_a , numbers_b , numbers_c )] # Plot data plt . hist ( numbers_max ) plt . title ( \"Histogram\" ) plt . xlabel ( \"value\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"count\" ) plt . show () if __name__ == '__main__' : main () and here is the plot for \\(n = 2\\) Plot of the maximum of 2 uniformly distributed variables with 10000 samples If you increase to \\(n = 3\\) you get: Plot of the maximum of 3 uniformly distributed variables with 10000 samples Improved version I've also created an improved version which makes nicer plots, but might be harder to read: #!/usr/bin/env python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy.random def main ( samples , n ): # Generate Data numbers_l = [] n = n + 1 for _ in range ( n ): numbers_l . append ( numpy . random . uniform ( size = samples )) # Plot data plots = [] for i in range ( 1 , n ): # Build data structure sublist = numbers_l [: i ] max_list = numbers_l [ 0 ] for numbers_list in sublist : for i , el in enumerate ( numbers_list ): max_list [ i ] = max ( max_list [ i ], el ) plot_i = plt . hist ( max_list , histtype = 'step' , bins = 200 ) plots . append ( plot_i ) plt . title ( \"Histogram\" ) plt . xlabel ( \"value\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"count\" ) plt . show () def get_parser (): from argparse import ArgumentParser , ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter parser = ArgumentParser ( description = __doc__ , formatter_class = ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter ) parser . add_argument ( \"-n\" , dest = \"n\" , default = 3 , type = int , help = \"n\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"-s\" , \"--samples\" , dest = \"samples\" , default = 1000 , type = int , help = \"number of samples per Y_n\" ) return parser if __name__ == '__main__' : args = get_parser () . parse_args () main ( args . samples , args . n ) When you call this script with $ ./plot-random-variable.py -n 4 --samples 100000 it gives Plot of the maximum of 1 - 4 uniformly distributed variables with 10000 samples See also List of probability distributions Basic Data Plotting with Matplotlib Part 3: Histograms","tags":"Mathematics","title":"Distribution of Random Variables when max gets applied"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/bug-reporting-a-users-perspective/","text":"Bug reporting is extremely important. It helps developers to get aware of problems and hence get the possibility to do something against it. It is impossible to guarantee for any real, non-trivial software that it has no bugs. Even when you formally prove that it is correct, the prove might be wrong. However, when users report bugs one can get confident that the remaining bugs are appearing very rarely or causing not so much harm. Reporting bugs is also important from a User Experience point of view. For me, it already helps to be able to report a bug / see that a bug was already reported. However, this is a pain in the ass for most software from a users perspective. I've just had that experience for Caja (the file explorer of MATE). Caja example Get information Caja crashed. I just wanted to create a new text file. Then it froze for about two seconds and closed. After another one or two seconds I got a crash report window. (I forgot to make a screenshot of that, but it looks like in the Google Chrome example) I clicked on something like \"examine locally\" - whatever that means. This is the first point I have to critize. The user should always know or at least be able to get the information what such messages mean. I was curious, so I clicked on it. Then this appeared: Apport 'examine locally' window This will launch apport-retrace in a terminal window to examine the crash. That is fine. Run gdb session Run gdb session without downloading debug symbols Update /var/crash/_usr_bin_caja.1000.crash with fully symbolic stack trace That is not ok. This might be good information for developers, but for normal users it is useless. There should be information when to use which one. For example: Which option takes most time (if there is a significant difference)? Is one option a superset of the other? Might one option contain private / secret information which I should not share? Lets try 'Run gdb session'. By the way, 'gdb' is the GNU project debugger. Error creating child process Hrmpf. Seems as if I found a bug while trying to report a bug... This happens for every option. Ok. Let's see if I can report the bug. As the automatic tools did not help, I check for a program version via Help > About : Caja About window Nice! It is obvious which version I use and how the program is called (Caja 1.8.2). There is even a link to a website where I could eventually report the bug. It links to www.mate-desktop.org . Report bug When I search for 'bug' on www.mate-desktop.org I get to Reporting Bugs . That seems to be a blog article which explains they are moving to GitHub with a link to github.com/mate-desktop . There are many repositories, so I have to search. Hrmpf. Then I get: Caja Repositories 5 repositories. Hrmpf. I guess it is simply 'caja'. When I click on this repository, I have to click on 'issues'. Now I am stuck. I don't know how to find a better description than \"it crashed\". There is certainly more information on my system, but I don't know how to get to it and I don't see any instructions how to do so. I also don't want to waste my time searching for information how to get information about the crash. Google Chrome example Just a few images... Step 1 Details 1 Details 2 Details 3 Details 4 What's wrong and how to fix it Did you notice how complicated this is for a user? This should be easier. In fact, I think if the bug reporting process is done right it could enhance the trust a user has in software, speed the fixing process up and help develpers to proritize what is important. Some basic steps could be: The automatic reporting tool should be created for non-developers. It should automatically store crash information in a place where the user can easily find it (e.g. /home/myaccount/.bugreports/caja/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm.xml) It should be stored in a format which the user can read (e.g. an xml file) The bug reporting website should be hosted by somebody else. Now the last one is important in my opinion. It makes sure that users know their bugs are not deleted / removed from the public just because it makes the software look bad. One could add metrics how confident users are, e.g. if you let users tell which software they use. In this case you can add graphs of how many users use the software and how many bugs / issues are reported. (The classification bugs and issues might also not be easy for users!) Existing Issue Trackers All of the following bug trackers seem to be developed for developers, not for users: Open Source Projects: Trac : Python Bugzilla : Perl Mantis Bug Tracker : PHP Redmine : Ruby on Rails Hosted Services: GitHub issues (e.g. for numpy ) Google Code (e.g. for chromium ) SourceForge (e.g. for dvdstyler ) Launchpad (e.g. for ubuntu ) GNU Savannah (e.g. for lordsawar ) See also: Comparison of source code software hosting facilities","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Bug Reporting - A users perspective"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/regular-expressions-with-python/","text":"Python supports regular expressions (RegEx) just as any other general purpose programming language. This mini article shows two examples how to use them. The package which gives RegEx support is called re . Replacing Spaces Replace multiple whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, ...) by a single space (by Nasir ): import re text = \"The fox jumped over the log.\" replaced = re . sub ( \"\\s\\s+\" , \" \" , text ) To speed things up you can also compile the pattern. This has also the advantage that you can specify that you want to match newline characters ( \\n and \\r ) with the dot by setting the re.DOTALL flag. import re pattern = re . compile ( \"\\s\\s+\" , re .

See Analyzing PyPI Data - 2 for part two. PyPI, the Python Package Index, gives a very crappy but simple interface to query metadata about its packages. I scrapped all of the packages metadata. 53,533 packages were scrapped (date: 2015-01-18), because I wanted to see if there is malware on PyPI (related to this question on security.SE ). The database looks like this: PyPI metadata Exploring the data When I scapped the data from PyPI, I made all database fields \"varchar 255\" as there seems to be no information about the possible values.

Also, the \";\" should not be here as the manual states it should be a list. The manual is also too short for this entry. It only says \"a list of platforms\" which seems to be pretty much useless. docstore.mik.ua gives a little bit more information A list of platforms on which this distribution is known to work. You should provide this information if you have reasons to believe this distribution may not work everywhere. This information should be reasonably concise, so this field may refer for details to a file in the distribution or to a URL. Bugtracker This one is very important. Users should have an easy possibility to report bugs. So please help them by added your bug tracker URL wherever it makes sense. Here is how you add it on PyPI: Go to your packages PyPI page Add your bugtracker / issue tracker url Check if you really added it License Another important one. Add a license to your software!

Most might be variants in writing, e.g. Apache License 2.0 Apache License, Version 2.0 Apache 2.0 are all the same license. Some packages have no licence ( Unknown and empty). Many are invalid values, like LICENSE.txt None LICENSE Python These indicate that people have no idea what to input there. tldrlegal.com might help in that case. I think the Python community should try to eliminate variants in writing license names as it makes finding, filtering and analyzing packages more difficult. Classifiers Python makes use of so called trove classifiers. They are defined in PEP 301 and listed here .

Let's focus on tabular first. It is always followed by a list of characters l , c , r which define if the column is left-aligned, centered or right-aligned. You can add | to tell LaTeX if there should be a line to distinguish columns. After that you get to the first cells. & starts a new cell and \\\\ starts a new line. If you want a drawn line / rule, you can use \\hline . Let's check out table : table has options after it which are commonly ht where h means \"here\" and t means \"top\". So LaTeX tries to place the table where it is in the text and if that doesn't work out it places the table on the top of the page. It can get a caption \\caption{Description of the contents of the table} and a \\label{table:your-label-for-internal-usage} . The standard way I always use \\usepackage{booktabs} to get \\toprule , \\midrule and \\bottomrule : \\documentclass [a4paper] { scrartcl } \\usepackage { amssymb, amsmath } % needed for math \\usepackage { booktabs } % for \\toprule, \\midrule and \\bottomrule \\begin { document } Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If you want to combine multiple rows you need to use \\usepackage{multirow} . Line Breaks in Cells \\parbox [t] { 1cm }{ This is the first \\\\ cell } See also: How to add a forced line break inside a table cell Page breaking tables If you want your tables to be able to break over pages, you have to use \\usepackage{longtable} which has an example . Another option is supertabular . When you use them, you should add \\endhead so that the head can get repeated. Tools truben.no/table is an awesome page to create tables for different formats. What could be better Page-breaking : I understand that you don't want to have page breaking of tables most of the time. But rather than never allowing page-breaking, I would expect an optimization with the following thoughts in mind: It is best to have the table where it was specified. The content should have at least 2 times as many rows as the header. So when there is only one header row, there should be at least 2 content rows. The farer a table is away from its \"original\" position, the worse it is. Headers : A semantic way to define the header and a tail would be very good. \\endhead is ok. Semantics, Styles and Classes : LaTeX hides some of the formatting for semantic codes. For example, you write \\section{MySection} instead of {\\fontsize{12}{15}\\textbf{MySection}} or something similar. That should be more often the case. In fact, I think it would be very nice if LaTeX had some built-in support for pure stylesheets (like CSS for HTML). It would be very nice if I only had to define that I want to make a standard table and it inserts \\toprule , \\midrule and \\bottomrule automatically. But to get an automatic \\midrule we need a command to tell LaTeX where the header ends. Everything of the above should be standard. There should not be the need to use new packages for that. Also, \\multirow , \\toprule , \\midrule , \\bottomrule should not be \"hidden\" in a package but be there by default. Table seperator : It is unfortunate that the table cell seperator(s) \\\\ and & have problems with matrices. I think one environment should get closed before the other one can continue parsing, so I don't quite understand where the problem is. But there certainly is a problem (see this question ). Tools : I don't know any tools that can export LaTeX tables and merge cells. Such tools should be able to import and export LaTeX tables See also Typesetting tables with LaTeX LaTeX/Tables","tags":"My bits and bytes","title":"LaTeX and tables"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/horspiele/","text":"This is a quic article I had for quite a while as a draft.

Nach dem Verkauf stellt der Ladeninhaber fest, dass der Ball nur 25 Euro kostet und schickt seinen Lehrling mit den überzähligen 5 Euro den Kindern nach. Der Lehrling gibt jedem Kind 1 Euro und behält für seine Bemühungen die restlichen 2 Euro. Damit hat jedes Kind nur 9 Euro für den Ball bezahlt, insgesamt zahlten die Kinder 27 Euro. Mit den 2 Euro des Lehrlings ergibt das aber erst 29 Euro. Quelle: dsm-faq.wikidot.com/denksport Auflösung Das Problem dieser Aufgabe ist, dass man sich nicht klar macht, wo man hin will. Man will scheinbar herausfinden, wo das Geld geblieben ist. Das vermischt man aber mit dem Geld, das man hatte: Situation vor dem Kauf: Kinder: je 10 Euro Lehrling: 0 Euro Ladeninhaber: 0 Euro Situation nach der Geschichte: 3 Kinder: je 1 Euro Lehrling: 2 Euro Ladeninhaber: 25 Euro Der Lehrling ist also derjenige, der das Problem trickreich macht, wenn man nicht aufpasst. Er bestiehlt die Kinder, deshalb zahlen sie praktisch 27 Euro anstelle der 25 Euro und von diesen 27 Euro hat der Ladeninhaber 25 Euro.

It might not be finished or have other problems, but I still want to share it. The problem The Vertex Coloring problem can be described like this: Vertex Coloring Let \\(G = (V, E)\\) be an undirected graph. Find a function \\(f: V \\rightarrow \\{1, \\dots, n\\}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that: \\(\\forall e=\\{v_1, v_2\\} \\in E: f(v_1) \\neq f(v_2)\\) . Minimize \\(n\\) . If \\(n\\) is minimal for \\(G\\) , it is called the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) . What does that mean? You have a graph. Then you take pencils and color the vertices such all vertices that are connected are not of the same color. Example All of the following graphs show valid thee colorings: [caption id=\"attachment_69831\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Valid thee colorings of one graph Source: Wikipedia [/caption] Interesting facts $1 \\leq \\chi(G) \\leq |V|$: You need at least one color and you could color all vertices with a different color $\\chi(K_n) = n$: All complete graphs with $n$ vertices need exactly $n$ colors. One color for each vertex. Every planar graph can be colored with 4 colors (see four color theorem ). Determining if a graph can be colored with 2 colors is equivalent to determining whether or not the graph is bipartite. This can be checked in polynomial time. You simply start with one vertex, give it color 1 and all adjacent vertices color 2. Then all adjacent vertices of color 2 have to have color 1, ... Vertex Coloring is in $\\mathcal{NPC}$. All triangle-free planar graphs can be 3-colored. You can get this coloring in linear time ( source ). Algorithms I think learning from errors is important. This is the reason why I share the following algorithm that do not work. First WRONG try: Fix adjacent vertices [caption id=\"attachment_69891\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"] A vertex coloring algorithm that does not work[/caption] The time complexity of this algorithm is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(|V|&#94;2)\\) . This should make you suspicious, as Vertex Coloring is in \\(\\mathcal{NPC}\\) . So if it was correct, it would solve the P vs. NP problem which is worth a million dollars. But an example why it doesn't work is better. Just try it for the following graph: [caption id=\"attachment_69921\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"] Example that does not work with the provided algorithm[/caption] Second WRONG try: Fix current vertex [caption id=\"attachment_69971\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"] Another vertex coloring algorithm[/caption] This algorithm gives a valid coloring, but the coloring is not minimal. Example: When you apply the algorithm the the graph below, you will get a coloring with four colors. But obviously, it is possible to color it with three colors. [caption id=\"attachment_69951\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"] Graph that can be vertex-colored with 3 colors[/caption] Brute force It's always a good idea to think about brute force algorithms. On the one hand, they are simple. So you can intuitively understand why they are correct and see their time / space complexity. On the other hand, you can use them for sanity checks of better algorithms for small problem instances. Here is a brute force algorithm for the vertex coloring problem [caption id=\"attachment_70001\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"] Brute force a minimal vertex coloring[/caption] You need \\(\\sum_{i=2}&#94;n i&#94;n\\) steps at maximum. Wow. This is MUCH. Even when you only want to check if \\(i\\) colors are enough, you need \\(i&#94;n\\) . You could use the second algorithm to get a better upper bound and try the next smaller ones. As soon as you don't get valid colorings, you know that the number of colors you've used in the last valid coloring was the minimum number. Zero-knowledge protocol Vertex coloring is relevant for so called \"zero-knowledge protocols\". This is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. A zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: Completeness : if the statement is true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover. Soundness : if the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. Zero-knowledge : if the statement is true, no cheating verifier learns anything other than this fact. This is formalized by showing that every cheating verifier has some ''simulator'' that, given only the statement to be proven (and no access to the prover), can produce a transcript that \"looks like\" an interaction between the honest prover and the cheating verifier. Source: Wikipedia Another great example is the following: Imagine your friend is color-blind. You have two billiard balls; one is red, one is green, but they are otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, and he is skeptical that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him (I say \"him\" as most color-blind people are male) that they are in fact differently-colored. On the other hand, you do not want him to learn which is red and which is green. Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to your friend so that he is holding one in each hand. You can see the balls at this point, but you don't tell him which is which. Your friend then puts both hands behind his back. Next, he either switches the balls between his hands, or leaves them be, with probability 1/2 each. Finally, he brings them out from behind his back. You now have to \"guess\" whether or not he switched the balls. By looking at their colors, you can of course say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if they were the same color and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than $\\frac{1}{2}$. If you and your friend repeat this \"proof\" $t$ times (for large $t$), your friend should become convinced that the balls are indeed differently colored; otherwise, the probability that you would have succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is at most $2&#94;{-t}$. Furthermore, the proof is \"zero-knowledge\" because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls. Source: mathoverflow.net Lets make this more concrete. Say you want to authenticate somebody. This person is identified as the \"only\" person who knows a three-coloring of a big graph. This makes him/her special. If you simply asked him \"what's the three coloring for your graph?\" he would no longer be the only person who knows the three coloring. So you want to get sure that he knows a three coloring without getting it.

Some friends wondered why I prefer Linux over Windows. As I am currently using only Linux, I can make some examples. Here is an open list, why I prefer Linux over Windows: No marketing strategies Windows 7 comes in may flavours: Windows 7 Home, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Professional, ... (see Microsoft product flavor hell ) I have to admit that the choice of Linux can be difficult, too. You can choose from different distributions like Ubuntu, Suse, Fedora, ... (see distrowatch.com ) and some distributions offer different desktop environments like GNOME and KDE. The important difference is that Linux flavors depend on your needs, but Windows flavors depend on your money. User-friendly system As a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS user, I think that Ubuntu is much more user friendly than Windows 7. You have much more control about your system than you have on Windows (see Why are Microsoft products so User unfriendly? ) Here are some everyday examples: Chaning the sound volume on a Notebook: You will see an indicator in Ubuntu like this . On Windows, you have to guess or wait until your movie starts Taking a screenshot: In Ubuntu, you only have to press \"Print Screen\". On Windows, you have to know Snipping tool or install some additional software. Additionally, it seems not to be possible to get a the key \"Print Screen\" as a shortcut for taking screenshots ( source ). Different workspaces, pinning a window to \"always in foreground\" is definitely missing in Windows. PDF-Printers : oh my god. This is really sad. Better community When I have questions for my system, I can ask them on askubuntu.com , unix.stackexchange.com or on ubuntuusers.de . I usually get friendly answers that help me to fix my problem within a few minutes. Where do I find answers to Windows questions? I have tried superuser.com , but is there anything else? Repositories When I want to install something on my Ubuntu machine, I simply type: sudo apt-get install something When I want to install something on Windows, I have to Google for it. When I find a tool which seems to fit, I have to find out if it is for free or if it's only a trial version. Then I need to find a way to download it and make sure that it's not malware. When I want to update all software I have on my linux machine, I type: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade After this command, my system and every single piece of software I have installed is updated. The updates are automatically installed in the background. A restart might be necessary, but until the restart is done the old software is used. On Windows, I have to: Click on the start button Type \"update\" in the search bar Click on \"Search for updates\" Install all updates A restart might be required. But I can't simply make the restart when I want to. No, on Windows you will get reminded. You can choose the delay (max. 4 hours) of the reminder, but you can't disable it. And this is only an update for the operating system. You have to look for updates of your software by yourself. For every single piece of software! This is not so easy. How do you find a reliable source of Updates e.g. for Unreal Tournament 2004? Terminal You can do everything with terminal. When the system is slowing down, I press Ctrl + Alt + F4 , log into the shell, call top and kill the process which slows my system down. And I really like ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH . Linux is gratis You don't have to pay for it. In comparison, Windows 7 costs now (31.12.2014) about 50 Euro on Amazon. Although it is already outdated. Simple stuff There are some simple, little things which I like when I use Linux. I can't name them all, but some that come to my mind are: LiveCD Isn't it great to have the possibility to use the OS from a CD / DVD only? This gives you the possibility to check if your system runs (or to diagnose what's going wrong) without chaning anything. Installation setup The installation setup is great. It detects at the beginning if everything is ok (disk space, internet connection, battery) and tells you in simple words what is wrong. To chose your time zone you are shown a very simple graphic and by now the default was always correct for me. It continues with keyboard detection. Although the default was always wrong for me by now, it has an awesome auto-detection tool. You simply have to type some letters and it returns your layout. Great! Reasons to stay with Windows Although I don't like Windows 7 for many reasons, I can see some reasons to stay with Windows: Linux doesn't support your hardware (see Check Computer / Hardware for Linux-compatibility ) Linux doesn't support your software AND no free alternative exists (e.g. Photoshop for professionals) Pseudo reasons for Linux A pseudo-reason is an argument which might be true, but is not important at all for the person who wrote it. Security I often hear that people like Linux because of higher security. I don't think that this is a real reason, as I have never heared of any end user having switched because of security reasons. I also don't think that there is a significant difference of the bare systems in security. Freedom to change code Some people argue, that you can change the code of Linux / OpenSource programs according to your needs. This is only an argument, if you have done it at least once. Pseudo reasons against Linux Linux is only for geeks This is obviously not true. I know at least some non-geeks who are able to use it. Linux supports NO games! Not true either. Steam gives A LOT of high quality games to Linux and you also have the possibility to use wine. However, if you want a specific game that might be a different story.","tags":"The Web","title":"Why I prefer Linux over Windows"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/dont-lose-your-stuff/","text":"This is a quick article I had for quite a while as a draft.

It might not be finished or have other problems, but I still want to share it. I wrote this when I did not know much about packaging. The following article is a wrap-up of the talk Python Packages from Daniel Hepper given at a German PyCon 2013 . distutils have very limited functionality. This is the reason why you should use setuptools. But 'distribute' is compatible to setuptools. PyPi is the Python Package Index. They distribute packages in form of \"eggs\". You can install them with easy_install or with pip. virtualenv / virtualenvwrapper Package Management Tools Distutils Distutils is part of the standard library. When you run python setup.py install then distutils is running. Major disadvantages of distutils are: No Meta-data: no deinstallation no dependencies No Package listing (so you can't automatically search pypi) Setuptools Setuptools are startet when you install a package with easy_install : easy_install package Setuptools are an extension for distutils. Setuptools offers dependency management. With setuptools, so called 'egg files' were introduced. Those files are comparable to jar files in Java. Distribute Distribute was a fork of setuptools that got merged back to setuptools. So don't use distribute, but use setuptools. Installer PIP PIP is short for 'PIP installs Python'. It can only install files from sources; so it does not support egg files. PIP commands are install uninstall freeze search bundle unzip zip wheel help Environments It might be the case that you have to have a Django 1.4 and a Django 1.5 project. In that case, you need different environments. Virtualenv $ pip freeze $ virtualenv my_env $ source my_env/bin/activate Virtualenvwrapper Creating packages A project could have this structure: $ tree . ├── LICENSE ├── MANIFEST ├── pyconde2013news │ └── __init__.py ├── README └── setup.py With this setup.py: from distutils.core import setup setup ( name = \"pycon2013news\" , version = \"0.1\" , py_modules = [ \"pycon2013news\" ],) This can directly be registered on PyPi: python setup.py register But a problem of this code is that it does not show the dependencies. So you should rather use setuptools for your setup.py: from setuptools import setup setup ( name = \"pycon2013news\" , version = \"0.1\" , py_modules = [ \"pycon2013news\" ], description = \"Reads latest news headlines from the PyCon.DE 2013 website\" ) author = \"Daniel Hepper\" , author_email = \"daniel@butfriendly.com\" , url = \"https://github.com/dhepper/pyconde2013news\" , install_requires = [ \"beautifulsoup4==4.3.2\" , \"requests==2.0.0\" ] When you add scripts argument to setup, you can later execute those.

It might not be finished or have other problems, but I still want to share it. What would you need to explore space? There are some ideas in science fiction like interstellar arks and near lightspeed travel. But one concept might be easier to realize: Self-replicating, autonomous machines. The Problem of Interstellar Arks Interstellar arks are space ships that are of enourmous size. They are big enough to have enough humans on it so that those humans can have childens over an limitles time without getting into trouble because of incest. Traill et al. [2007] suggests that you need about 4000 individuals for a minimal viable population. Those 4000 people would need food, air, personal space. You would need resources to repair the ship and explore planets. Medicine. You would need fuel. That would be a lot of stuff. Bringing stuff from earth to space is expensive. And those people would eventually be trapped on that ship for many, many generations before they might find another habitable planet. You might eventually need to do terraforming . I can't even imagine the number of resources that would be needed for that. The next problem is that you would want the explorers to keep contact with earth. Those signals would either have to be highligh redundant (see error correcting codes ) or they might get received only partially. So eventually you would like to get relay stations that catch up the signal, correct errors (or request a new send of the broken part) and send it again. An ark would have to carry everything for that. That's a problem because sending so much stuff from earth to space is expensive. The alternative: Replicating Machines An alternative might be replicating machines. Machines don't need personal space. They don't need air. They don't need food or medicine. They don't run into psychical problems. But they do need energy. They need resources. And they either need to be really intelligent or they need to have clear instructions. I a working minimal space exploring construction kit (let's call it MISECK, because that's much shorter than 'minimal space exploring construction set') should be able to do the following: Construct other MISECKs from resources that can be found in space (e.g. on asteroids, moons or planets). The plural was intended. Every MISECK would have to be able to produce at least two other MISECKs. Build communication satelites : That communication satelite would act as a relay station. It talks with other satelites, receives messages and sends messages. It is able to check if the received message has errors and request a new message in case of errors. They should also store as much information as possible. This way, one could eventually contact them and get information that might otherwise get lost. Build exploration satelites which can gather information about a planet. This information should be send to the communication satelites and finally back to earth. Build mining and construction robots that are able to mine all resources needed to construct MISECKS. That will include melting ore and constructing fabrics which are able to produce computer chips. Build power plants . Those might be solar cells, fusion/fission reactors or something completely different. But something has to provide the energy to make it possible to run all those machines and to travel enormous distances in space. Explore and coordinate : This is a collaborative planning task. MISECKs have to know where other MISECKs are. If one MISECK gets destroyed by anything, there might still be something that is worth exploring.

This was the title of a question I've recently found on Quora. I think this question is very interesting and I would like to share my thoughts about it. I think the answer is mathematics and computer science. Or lets rather say algorithms. There are multiple problems in mathematics and computer science which could have a severe impact on some areas which are important for the worlds economy. As we live in a globalized world, this will affect most of humanity. As algorithms don't cost anything except for developing cost, it is certainly below 1 million dollars. In principle, everybody could come up with such algorithms. P vs NP The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems . Stated extremely simple, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. If somebody found an algorithm which solves one problem in the class NPC in fast, it will eventually boost many problems or allow us to solve problems which were not solvable before. Especially optimization problems. Optimization problems There could be other algorithms which boost optimization problems, but do not help for the P vs. NP problem. Optimization is about allocating just the right amount of resources for a couple of goals to get the highest outcome. Fully homomorphic encryption Finding efficient solutions for the problem that we don't want cloud computing providers to know our data, but we want them to use their efficient data centers to run calculations on them. This would boost cloud computing and lead to a more efficient use of computational resources. A.I. The development of a strong A.I. could lead to a technological singularity. This would be a boost for technology incomparable to anything before. However, even advancements in A.I. which are not strong A.I.s will help. They can lead to many new products where humans cannot cope with the data volume. One example would be medicine. IBM's Watson is one first step to help doctors skip through the possible thousands of diagnoses and finding the most relevant and recent papers which could fit the problems of a patient. New diagnoses could be developed, the computer could help to create better (more accurate) tests for diseases. It could help to track the spread of diseases, predict it and thus help to contain it. Parallelization and Compilers Developing a tool which automatically parallelizes sequential code could make all applications go faster. The same is true for advances in compiler technology. This could lead to less energy consumption and faster devices. As most people have contact to computers nowadays, this would affect everybody.

That could be anything. Typical examples are route finding algorithms, chess programs, ego shooter computer opponents and classifiers. The last category of AIs (classifiers) is huge and includes programs which try to find out what you were writing (see my bachelor's thesis ), try to figure out who is on an image (face recognition) or what was spoken (automatic speech recognition). Strong and Weak AIs Science fiction literature distinguishes two kinds of AIs: Weak AIs and strong AIs. Currently, we only know weak AIs. They can do incredible things (see A.I. in Computer Games and Awesome Robots ), but that is nothing compared to a stong AI. Strong AIs are capable of adapting to completely new tasks. They can do creative work. In other words, they can do any task any human could do. They can do research and compose the most beautiful art. As they are machines which will be build by somebody (hence the term 'artificial'), they are better understood than our biological brains. Strong AIs will be able to understand how they work themselfes and very likely be able to improve themselfes. This is the point where a technological singularity happens. The machines start developing faster than any human can comprehend how they improve. At some point they will even develop faster than humankind together can understand. Now that you know the context, I would like to share an answer to the following question I've recently seen: What would change with strong AIs? What happens when machines take all of our jobs including creative/research/artistic ones? Something like that would not happen instantly. It is a gradual process. Many answers say something like nothing would be scarce. Well, I think that is wrong for two reasons: Scarcity of resources : Oil, gold and diamonds are expensive. But they are not (only) expensive because it takes a high amount of work to get them, but also because the number of diamonds on earth is limited. More or cheaper \"work hours\" like much better AIs combined with much better robots would not solve that problem. Oh, and please don't forget energy! Distribution : I think we produce enough food so that nobody on earth would have to starve. We certainly have enough clean water for everybody. Why do so many people still starve and don't have access to clean water? Because the distribution is not equal. Europe and the US make use of much more resources per person than Africa does. The richest 1% of the US make use of MUCH more resources than the bottom 30% (I guess the numbers are more extreme). Who do you think would own the robots that take the jobs? Who would profit from this much cheaper work hours? I think AIs that would in principle be able to solve any problem a human could solve (e.g. creating art and conducting research) would cause serious social problems if we don't adapt to the new situation. Such AIs would have the potential for a much worse world than we currently live in. However, with the right politics, it could vastly improve our world. Having the insight how such AIs work, we could make them decide ultimatively unbiased for a greater good. They could be used to arbitrate a dispute as a neutral, intelligent instance. They could accelerate research. They could help us to understand ourselves. Job market What is the effect of technological singularity in job market? In a ideal world, everybody would only do the job he or she wants to do. We would eventually work less, but I think we would still work. Humans are resources and as such they will always be valuable in any economy. Another, darker, scenario is that AIs would gradually remove whole industries, starting with simple ones. Taxi and truck drivers are not necessary. They could step-by-step be replaced by AIs. However, no new jobs would be created for those people. They would have to get aid by the government. But as they would get less money, the economy would focus on the people who have money. That would be the people who own the AIs. At some point people would realize that they will never be able to get a new job. Even worse, their children will never be able to get a job. Extreme poverty would rise as the state gets less taxes (as less goods are consumed, because people have less money). The AIs would predict how every single person would most likely act. How could they do so? Well, you have a smartphone. Your conversations on WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, ... get tracked and automatically analyzed. You can be predicted to a certain degree. You can be influenced by personalized advertising. A really clever AI will make itself able to act in any possible scenario, replicate itself and make itself less dependent. In this dark scenario people would eventually start at some point to try to get more money from the people controlling the AIs, but how do you force them to do so? The police might also be replaced by AIs. My guess is that the reality would be somewhere in between. A couple of super-rich people and the rest giving them massages. A possible solution to those social problems I've just described that AIs might cause serious social problems. However, I think we can solve those problems by making sure that income inequality cannot get too high. This means there should be very high and effective inheritance tax as well as a taxation system that prevents people from getting too rich / people too poor. The most extrem action to prevent too poor people is an unconditional income, the most extrem action to prevent people getting too rich is an upper limit on what somebody could have. I think an unconditional income would be a good thing, but its hard to tell how high that should be. The easiest way to prevent people from getting too rich is adding a tax system that adjusts to income: Your first 0 - 2000 Euro / month don't get taxed at all Your next 2001 - 3000 Euro / month get taxed with 0% + (100%/2) = 50% Your next 3001 - 4000 Euro / month get taxed with 50% + (50%/2) = 75% Your next 4001 - 5000 Euro / month get taxed with 75% + (25%/2) = 87.5% ... You can (and should - I think my numbers are not well-chosen!) argue about the exact numbers, but I guess you get what I mean. The tax should never be 100%, thus leaving the possibility to get more money. But the difficulty to do so should increase. This effectively prevents that some people get too rich and hence resulting in a very instable system. It would be important to do so before anybody develops a strong AI.

Rating systems are relatively straight-forward to build, but they need much data and get better with more data. I think Amazon builds a monopoly that way. However, I also think we could build an Universal Rating System (URS). Just as important as pure rating are reviews. What would an URS need? Directly neccessary are Identification of people : The same person should not be able to write multiple reviews or make multiple ratings for the same product. It is not important to tell which online-identity belongs to which person. In fact, I think it would be good if it was possible to keep users anonym while making sure that everybody has only one online-identity. Identification of products : Users have to be able to find products and they have to find reviews to that product. So some kind of product identification number is necessary. Ratings for reviews Uploading photographs Product description : This should be objective. Indirectly necessary are Recommendations : If users see that they get good recommendations from an independant source they might use the system. If they see that those recommendations imporve with more reviews and more ratings, they add more of them. This way the system gets better. Possibility to compare products : Examples are phonearena.com , ark.intel.com and others. But they are always limited to some products. Search : Users should be able to search for a product by specifying it. This could be a price range, a category, a review average, a minimum number of reviews, ... Easy login : Something like OpenID that makes it easy for users to create an account and sign in. * Right incentives : Having a great community is much about giving the right incentives. Badages and Karma are a great way to do so as shown with StackExchange. Non-software parts Advertisment : People have to get informed about such a system. Organization : The software should be OpenSource, the data should be published (as far as possible without breaking privacy) and the organization which runs the software should be a nonprofit organization. The reason is simply that it prevents abuse. Product registration : Companies should have the possibility to register their products to get an identification number. Project name : A good name is important. Any ideas? Existing Projects Does anybody know if such a project already exists? If there is no such project by now: Is anybody interested in working on it?","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Universal Rating System"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/nyquist-shannon-sampling-theorem/","text":"The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that you have to sample more than twice the highest frequency.

Ich finde daran sieht man schön, wie JML funktioniert: public class PostInc { public PostInc rec ; public int x , y ; /*@ public invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0 && @ rec.x >= 0 && rec.y >= 0; @*/ /*@ public normal_behavior @ requires true; @ ensures rec.x == \\old(rec.y) && @ rec.y == \\old(rec.y) + 1; @*/ public void postinc () { rec . x = rec . y ++; } } Quelle: 28JML.pdf#page=3 Wichtig ist noch: /*@ @ assignable \\nothing; @ ensures (\\forall int j; l <= j && j < \\result; a1[j] != a2[j] ); @*/ Das assignable \\nothing besagt, dass keine Werte (nach außen sichtbar) verändert werden dürfen. Die Schleifen-Syntax ist \\forall int i; B; R , wobei B eine Bereichseinschränkung und R der Schleifenrumpf ist. Es gibt auch noch \\exists int i; B; R . Die Prädikatenlogischen Operatoren sind ! : Negation && : und || : oder ==> : Implikation <==> : Äquivalenz == : Gleichheit public int commonEntry ( int l , int r ) { int k = l ; /*@ loop_invariant @ l <= k && k <= r && @ (\\forall int i; l<=i && i<k; a1[i] != a2[i]); @ assignable \\nothing; @ decreases a1.length - k; @*/ while ( k < r ) { if ( a1 [ k ] == a2 [ k ]){ break ;} k ++; } return k ; } Quelle: 28JML.pdf#page=44 Modallogik Interpretation $\\square A$ bzw. $\\square_p A$ $\\diamond A$ A ist notwendigerweise wahr A ist möglicherweise wahr Zeit A ist zu jedem zukünfigem Zeitpunkt wahr Es gibt einen zukünftigen Zeitpunkt zu dem A wahr ist Glauben Ein Agent p glaubt A A ist konsistent mit den Aussagen, die p für wahr hält Wissen Ein Agent p weiß A p weiß nicht, dass A falsch ist Programmausführung Nach Ausführung des Programs p gilt A Es gibt eine Ausführung des Programs p, nach der A wahr ist Kurz und Gut Die folgenden Stichpunkte sollte man (größtenteils nur sinngemäß) auswendig können und verstehen: Eine Signatur \\(\\Sigma\\) ist eine abzählbare Menge von Symbolen. Die Elemente der Signatur heißen \"Aussagevariablen\". Eine Interpretation ist eine Abbildung \\(I: \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\{W, F\\}\\) Ein Modell einer Formel \\(A \\in For0_\\Sigma\\) ist eine Interpretation \\(I\\) mit \\(val_I(A) = W\\) . Ein Modell einer Formel ist also einfach eine Variablenbelegung, welche die Formel erfüllt. Für \\(M \\subseteq For0_\\Sigma, A \\in For0_\\Sigma\\) gilt: \\(M \\models A\\) (lies: aus M folgt A), falls jede Variablenbelegung, welche \\(M\\) erfüllt, auch \\(A\\) erfüllt. \\(A \\rightarrow B \\equiv \\neg A \\lor B\\) \\(A \\models B\\) gdw. \\(\\models A \\rightarrow B\\) Der shannon-Operator \\(sh(a,b,c)\\) ist if(a) {c} else {b}. Die Craig-Interpolation von \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) ersetzt alle Aussagevariablen \\(\\{\\text{Aussagevariable } a \\in A | a \\notin B\\}\\) mit \\(c_i\\) ( \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\) ). Die Interpolante ist dann \\(C := \\bigvee_{(c_1, \\dots, c_n) \\in \\{0,1\\}&#94;n} A[c_1, \\dots, c_n]\\) . Eine DNF heißt \"vollständig\" bzgl. einer Signatur \\(\\Sigma\\) , wenn falls für jedes \\(P \\in \\Sigma\\) in jeder Klausel entweder \\(P\\) oder \\(\\neg P\\) vorkommt. Eine DNF heißt \"minimal\", wenn jede kürzere Formel nicht äquivalent ist. KKNF-Konstruktion: (1) Shortcuts \\(Q_1, \\dots, Q_n\\) für binäre Operatoren erstellen. Diese Shortcuts dürfen auch andere Shortcuts verwenden (2) Äquivalenzen auflösen (3) In KNF umformen. \\(sh(P_i, A, B)\\) heißt normiert, wenn \\(A\\) und \\(B\\) normiert sind und jede in \\(A \\cup B\\) vorkommende Variable \\(P_j\\) gilt \\(i < j\\) . Ein Shannon-Graph heißt reduziert, wenn es keine zwei Knoten \\(v,w\\) gibt, sodass die beiden in \\(v\\) und \\(w\\) verwurzelten Teilbäume isomorph sind und es auch keinen Knoten gibt, bei dem beide ausgehenden Kanten in den selben Nachfolger führen. Reduzierter Shannon-Graph = OBDD = BDD = ordered binary decisio diagram Bei gegebener Indizierung sind reduzierte Shannon-Graphen bis auf Isomorphie eindeutig. Ist die Indizierung nicht gegeben, macht die Variablenanordnung einen großen Unterschied in der Größe (Knotenmenge) des reduzierten Shannon-Graphen. Multiplikation \\(k\\) -stelliger Binärzahlen: Für jede Ordnung \\(<\\) der Variablen in \\(X=\\{x_0, \\dots, x_{k-1}, y_0, \\dots, y_{k-1}\\}\\) gibt es einen Index \\(0 \\leq i < 2k\\) , sodass der BDD \\(B_{Mult_i,<}\\) mindestens \\(2&#94;{k/8}\\) Knoten besitzt. Horn-Formel: Formel in KNF, wobei jede Klausel höchstens ein positives Literal enthält. Negationsnormalform: Negationen nur vor Atomen. Bereinigte Formel: (1) \\(Frei(A) \\cap Bd(A) = \\emptyset\\) (2) Die hinter Quantoren stehenden Variablen sind paarweise verschieden. Pränexe Normalform: \\(A = Q_1 x_1 Q_2 x_2 Q_3 x_3 \\dots Q_n x_n B\\) , wobei \\(B\\) quantorenfrei sein muss. Dann heißt \\(B\\) die Matrix von \\(A\\) . Die Pränexe Normalform ist nicht eindeutig. Skolem-Normalform: (1) geschlossene Formel (2) \\(\\forall x_1 \\dots \\forall x_n B\\) (3) Matrix \\(B\\) ist in KNF Gödelscher Vollständigkeitssatz : Es gibt einen Kalkül der PL1 derart, dass für jede Formelmenge \\(\\Gamma\\) und für jede Formel \\(\\varphi\\) gilt: \\(\\varphi\\) folgt genau dann aus \\(\\Gamma\\) , wenn \\(\\varphi\\) im Kalkül aus \\(\\Gamma\\) hergeleitet werden kann. In Zeichen: \\(\\Gamma \\models \\varphi \\Leftrightarrow \\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi\\) . Gödelscher Unvollständigkeitssatz : Jedes hinreichend mächtige, rekursiv aufzählbare formale System ist entweder widersprüchlich oder unvollständig. Jedes hinreichend mächtige konsistente formale System kann die eigene Konsistenz nicht beweisen. Kompaktheitssatz: Wenn A aus einer unendlichen Teilmenge der Formelmenge folgt, dann auch aus einer endlichen. Endlichkeitssatz: Eine Menge \\(M \\subseteq For_\\Sigma\\) hat genau dann ein Modell, wenn jede endliche Teilmenge von \\(M\\) ein Modell hat. Der Resolutionskalkül arbeitet nur mit Formeln in Skolemnormalform. Tableau-Kalkül: Typ- \\(\\alpha\\) : Alles, was keine Quantoren hat und eindeutig ist Typ- \\(\\beta\\) : Alles, was keine Quantoren hat, aber nicht eindeutig ist Typ- \\(\\gamma\\) : Unendlich viele Typ- \\(\\delta\\) : min. eines Ob eine prädikatenlogische Formel allgemeingültig ist, ist unentscheidbar. Die Menge der allgemeingültigen prädikatenlogischen Formeln ist rekursiv aufzählbar. Die Menge der erfüllbaren prädikatenlogischen Formeln ist nicht rekursiv aufzählbar. Ein Reduktionssystem ist ein Tupel \\((D, \\succ)\\) , wobei \\(D \\neq \\emptyset\\) eine Menge ist und \\(\\succ\\) eine Relation auf \\(D\\) ist. \\(\\rightarrow\\) bezeichnet die reflexive, transitive Hülle von \\(\\succ\\) . \\(\\stackrel{+}{\\rightarrow}\\) bezeichnet die transitive Hülle von \\(\\succ\\) . \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) bezeichnet die reflexive, transtive und symmetrische Hülle von \\(\\succ\\) . \\((D, \\succ)\\) heißt konfluent \\(:\\Leftrightarrow \\forall s_1, s_2, s_3 \\in D\\) mit \\(s \\rightarrow s_1 \\land s \\rightarrow s_2 \\exists t \\in D: s_1 \\rightarrow t \\land s_2 \\rightarrow t\\) \\((D, \\succ)\\) heißt lokal konfluent \\(:\\Leftrightarrow \\forall s_1, s_2, s_3 \\in D\\) mit \\(s \\succ s_1 \\land s \\succ s_2 \\exists t \\in D: s_1 \\rightarrow t \\land s_2 \\rightarrow t\\) \\((D, \\succ)\\) heißt noethersch, wenn es keine unendlichen Folgen \\(s_0 \\succ s_1 \\dots \\succ s_i \\succ \\dots\\) gibt. Ein konfluentes und noethersches Reduktionssystem heißt kanonisch. Ein Element \\(s \\in D\\) heißt irreduzibel (oder eine Normalform) in \\((D, \\succ)\\) , wenn kein \\(t \\in D\\) existiert mit \\(s \\succ t\\) . Sei \\(s \\in D\\) . Ein Element \\(s_0 \\in D\\) heißt eine Normalform für \\(s\\) in \\((D, \\succ)\\) , wenn \\(s_0\\) irreduzibel ist und \\(s \\rightarrow s_0\\) gilt. In kanonischen Reduktionssystemen hat jedes Element eine eindeutige Normalform. \\((D, \\succ)\\) ist noethersch und lokal konfluent \\(\\Rightarrow (D, \\succ)\\) ist konfluent. Eine Kripke-Struktur ist ein Tupel \\(\\mathscr{K} = (S, R, I)\\) mit \\(S \\neq \\emptyset\\) ist die Menge der Zustände bzw. der möglichen Welten. \\(s \\in S\\) heißt also auch eine \"Welt\". \\(R \\subseteq S \\times S\\) ist die Zugänglichkeitsrelation \\(I: (\\Sigma \\times S) \\rightarrow \\{W, F\\}\\) ist die Interpretation der Aussagenlogischen Variablen \\((S, R)\\) heißt der Kripke-Rahmen von \\(\\mathscr{K}\\) . \\(\\square A \\rightarrow A\\) ist nur in reflexiven Kripke-Strukturen eine Tautologie. Ein endlicher Automat ist ein Tupel \\((S, V, \\delta, s_0, S_1)\\) , wobei \\(S\\) eine endliche Zustandsmenge ist, \\(V\\) ein endliches Alphabet (terminale Zeichen) ist, \\(\\delta: S \\times V \\rightarrow S\\) eine Funktion ist, die besagt bei welchem Eingabezeichen man von welchem Zustand aus in welchen Zustand kommt, \\(s_0 \\in S\\) ein Startzustand und \\(S_1 \\subseteq S\\) die Menge der Endzustände ist \\(V&#94;\\omega\\) ist die Menge der unendlichen Wörter mit Buchstaben aus \\(V\\) . \\(w(n)\\) ist der \\(n\\) -te Buchstabe des Wortes \\(w\\) . \\(w \\downarrow (n)\\) ist das endliche Anfangsstück \\(w(0)\\dots w(n)\\) von \\(w\\) . \\(\\varepsilon \\notin V&#94;\\omega\\) Für \\(K \\in V&#94;*\\) und \\(J \\in V&#94;\\omega\\) ist \\(KJ=\\{w_1 w_2 | w_1 \\in K, w_2 \\in J\\}\\) Für \\(K \\in V&#94;*\\) ist \\(\\overset{\\rightarrow}{K}=\\{w \\in V&#94;\\omega | w \\downarrow (n) \\in K \\text{ für unendlich viele } n\\}\\) Ein Büchi-Automat ist ein nicht deterministischer endlicher Automat, der Wörter akzeptiert, wenn es eine Berechnungsfolge mit unendlich vielen Finalzuständen gibt. (vgl. Beispiel ) A U B: A gilt, bis B gilt (das U steht für \"until\"). Allerdings gilt B auch irgendwann. Es kann also nicht sein, dass A unendlich lange gilt und B nie. \\(A\\;\\textbf{U}_W\\;B\\) bedeutet, dass entweder immer A und gleichzeitig nie B gilt, oder dass irgendwann B gilt und davor gilt immer A. Das 'W' steht für 'weak'. \\(A\\;\\textbf{V}\\;B\\) : B gilt so lange, bis A gilt. Daher wird V auch 'Release-Operator' genannt. \\(\\diamond \\square P\\) : Es gibt einen Zeitpunkt, ab dem immer B gilt. Zu jeder LTL-Formel gibt es einen effektv konstruierbaren Büchi-Automaten. Erfüllbarkeit und Allgmeingültigkeit von LTL-Formeln ist entscheidbar. Ein Kalkül ist korrekt, wenn alles was formal ableitbar auch wahr ist. (vgl. Korrektheit (Logik) ) 08Pk1Semantik-print.pdf, Folie 34/37: QxB steht für \"Quantor x B\", wobei der Quantor entweder \\(\\exists\\) oder \\(\\forall\\) ist, \\(x\\) eine Variable ist und \\(B\\) eine Formel ist. Wissens-Check Folgende Fragen sollte man für die Klausur schnell beantworten können: Nenne 3 Basen für die Aussagenlogik. Eine davon soll höchstens einen Operator haben. In welcher Komplexitätsklasse ist das Erfüllbarkeitsproblem für 3-KNF? In welcher 2-KNF? Wie sieht es mit dem Allgemeingültigkeitsproblemen aus? Was ist der Shannon-Graph von \\(1\\) ? Was ist der Shannon-Graph von \\(0\\) ? Was ist der Shannon-Graph von \\(a \\lor b\\) ? Was ist der Shannon-Graph von \\(a \\land b\\) ? Meine Fragen 02, Folie 19/29 : Warum wird einmal \\(\\models\\) und dann \\(\\models_\\Sigma\\) geschrieben? 07, Folie 19/51 : Warum \"fast alle\" \\(x \\in Var\\) ? Was bedeutet das? Es dürfen nur endlich viele Variablen umbenannt bzw. durch einen Term ersetzt werden. Andernfalls werden die Beweise und Notationen hässlich. Abzählbar unendlich viele Variablen sind praktisch, wenn man sich die Existenz immer weiterer Variablen sichern will, die nicht in einer gegebenen Formel auftauchen. Natürlich ist jede Formel endlich, enthält also nur endlich viele Variablen. Folie 8/30 : Wieso stimmt diese Umformung? Gebundene Variablen dürfen unabhängig von freien umbenannt werden. Die andere Umformung kann nachvollzogen werden, wenn die Implikation \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) zu \\(\\neg A \\vee B\\) umgeformt wird. Man beachte folgende Umformungsregel: \\(\\neg \\forall x F(x) \\equiv \\exists x \\neg F(x)\\) . Folie 23/30 : Was ist eine Grundinstanz? Wo ist der Unterschied zwischen \"Grundinstanz\" und \"Instanz\"? Was sind \"Grundterme\"? Grundterm: Ein Term, der keine Variablen enthält. Instanz: Für quantifizierte Variablen wurden Terme eingesetzt. Grundinstanz: Für alle Variablen wurden Grundterme eingesetzt. Damit enthalten Grundinstanzen überhaupt keine Variablen mehr. Folie 24/30 : Was ist ein Beispiel für \\(D = Term_\\Sigma&#94;0 \\neq\\) Menge der Grundterme? Wo gilt 2. nicht? Ich vermute mal, dass \\(Term_\\Sigma&#94;0 := $ Menge der Grundterme. Bachte (sofern die Definition stimmt): $Term_\\Sigma&#94;0 \\subseteq Term_\\Sigma\\) , da es auch Terme gibt, die Variablen enthalten, falls welche in der Signatur vorhanden sind. Was ist die Bedeutung von Herbrand-Strukturen / dem Satz von Herbrand? Blatt 6, Lösung zu Aufgabe 4 : Den Teil mit der Umwandlung einer Aussagenlogischen Formel verstehe ich nicht. Kann das jemand bitte für \\(a \\land \\neg b \\lor c \\lor d\\) erklären? Blatt 9, Lösung zu Aufgabe 1 : Ist der Baum, also insbesondere die ersten 4 Knoten, richtig? Warum steht in Knoten 1 nicht \\(1\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z (r(x,y) \\land r(y,z) \\rightarrow r(x,z))\\) ? Wie funktioniert der 1. Schritt in Aufgabe 2? Haben reflexive Relationen irreduzible Elemente? Laut unserer Definition nicht. Aber du kannst jede n-stellige Relation mit dem Komplement der n-stelligen Gleichheits-Relation schneiden, dann erhältst du ihr irreflexives Gegenstück. Können reflexive Relationen noethersch sein? Nur, wenn sie leer sind. Ansonsten gibt es immer unendliche Ketten. Folie 27 : Wie muss ich \\(\\square \\diamond P\\) lesen? Von jeder erreichbaren Welt aus gibt es eine erreichbare Welt, in der P gilt. Die Verbalisierung der Relation \"erreichbar\" klappt immer ;) Blatt 12, Aufgabe 1b : Was sagt \\(\\diamond\\square P\\) auf dem Graphen aus? Insbesondere: Warum ist \\(w_5\\) nicht in \\(\\diamond\\square P\\) ? Was wäre \\([[\\square \\diamond P]]\\) ? Blatt 12, Aufgabe 4 : Das muss ich noch mal in Ruhe durchgehen. 21, Folie 8 : Was ist \\(Th(N)\\) und was ist \\(Cn(PA)\\) ? \\(Th(N)\\) : Theoreme über N, also die Menge aller Formeln, für die die natürlichen Zahlen ein Modell sind. Cn(PA): Menge aller Formeln, die aus den Axiomen der Peano-Artihmetik gefolgert werden können. Da die Peano-Arithmetik korrekt ist, ist jede Formel aus Cn(PA) auch in Th(N). 50, Folie 16 : Was bedeutet es, dass \\(Th(N)\\) nicht rekursiv ist? Rekursiv heißt entscheidbar. Da die Peano-Axiome durch die Peano-Artihmetik formalisiert werden können, gibt es eine Formel P(x), die genau dann wahr ist, wenn für x die Kodierung einer solchen Formel eingesetzt wird, die sich nicht aus den Peano-Axiomen herleiten lässt. Nach dem Gödelschen Unvollständigkeitssatz gibt es nun eine Formel P und x derart, dass x mit der Kodierung von P(x) übereinstimmt: Eine Formel also, die über sich selbst behauptet, sie sei nicht herleitbar. Da es nur ein Modell gibt, ist jede Formel entweder unerfüllbar oder allgemeingültig. Wenn \\(Th(N)\\) entscheidbar wäre und P(x) allgemeingültig, dann entsteht Widerspruch zur Wahl von P und x. Wenn P(x) unerfüllbar wäre, ist nach Wahl von P und x P(x) herleitbar, was wieder einen Widerspruch darstellt. Um den Widerspruch aufzulösen, darf \"aus den PA-Axiomen herleitbar\" nicht mit \"im Modell der nat. Zahlen gültig\" übersetzt werden. 23, Folie 5 : Kann mir jemand ein konkretes Beispiel geben? 43, Folie 2 : Was sind omega-Strutkuren und insbesondere was bedeutet \\(2&#94;P\\) ? Eine Omega Struktur Ordnet jedem Zeitpunkt, wenn die natürlichen Zahlen als Zeitstrahl aufgefasst werden, eine Menge von aussagenlogischen Variablen zu, die als \"wahr\" gelten sollen. \\(2&#94;P\\) ist die Potenzmenge von P. Ist \\(A\\;\\textbf{U}_W\\;B\\) äquivalent zu \\(B\\;\\textbf{V}\\;A\\) ? Blatt 14, 2a : Warum ist \\(\\diamond (p\\;\\textbf{U}\\;q)\\) äquivalent zu \\(\\diamond q\\) ? Ich dachte es wäre äquivalent zu \\(p\\;\\textbf{U}\\;q\\) ? Blatt 14, 3 : Wie würde der Automat aussehen, wenn das \\(X\\) weggelassen würde? Blatt 14, 4 : Das würde ich gerne gemeinsam durchgehen. 50, 13 : Was sind die Ziele der Beweistheorie? Was ist die Grundidee des Hilbert-Kalküls? Ziele: Automatisches Beweisen ermöglichen und die Grenzen bestimmen. Grundidee des Hilbert-Kalküls: Aus Axiomen konstruktiv Formeln folgern. Im Gegensatz zu den praxis-orientierten Beweisverfahren kann der Hilbert-Kalkül leichter in theoretischen Beweisen verwendet werden. Der Gödelsche Unvollständigkeitssatz verwendet z.B. den Hilbert-Kalkül. 50, 13 : \"Aussagenlogische Tableauregeln aus Wahrheitstafeln konstruieren.\" - was ist damit gemeint? 50, 15 : Was ist die Grundidee der Peano-Arithmetik? Liegt doch eigentlich auf der Hand: Zahlentheoretische Aussagen automatisch beweisen. 50, 33 : Wie kann man sich in dem Beispiel den Unterschied zwischen Prädikaten und Funktionen erschließen? Funktionen sind immer in Prädikaten enthalten. Ein Prädikat darf kein weiteres Prädikat enthalten. Wie ist Erfüllbarkeit in der Prädikatenlogik definiert? Z.B. erscheint mir \\(\\exists x p(x)\\) erfüllbar, wenn nichts weiter gegeben ist. Wenn man aber \\(p(x)=False\\) für alle \\(x\\) sagt, dann ist es unerfüllbar. F ist erfüllbar gdw. es ein Modell für F gibt, d.h. eine Interpretation I, sodass val_I(F) = W. Müssen die Kanten von Shannon-Graphen mit W und F oder mit 1 und 0 beschriftet werden? Praktisch alle Altklausuren verwenden 1 und 0, aber ich meine er hätte in der Vorlesung gesagt, dass wir W und F verwenden sollen. Ist die Menge der allgemeingültigen / erfüllbaren / unerfüllbaren Formeln der PL1 abzählbar? Jede Teilmenge aus \\(\\Sigma&#94;*\\) ist abzählbar für ein endliches Alphabet \\(\\Sigma\\) . Es gibt aber überabzählbar viele Teilmengen, deren Elemente zwar wieder abzählbar sind, aber sowohl die Teilmengen selbst als auch ihre Elemente nicht aufzählbar sind. Beachte: Aufzählbar \\(\\neq\\) Abzählbar. Wie kann man \\(U\\) durch \\(U_W\\) darstellen? Altklausuren WS2010/2011, 1. Zwischentest, A4: Ist der Markierungsalgorithmus für Hornformeln relevant?

Backpropagation is an efficient implementation of gradient descent, where a rule can be formulated which has some recursively defined parts.

In this article, I would like to point out some very nice applications of 3D printing. Medicine 3D printing has basically two application in medicine: Very customized non-organic parts or organic printing. Printing a human Kidney \"Magic Arms\" prosthetic 3D printing gives man new face Other examples Hearing aids Bones Print on wounds Shoes I am always struggling with finding good shoes. Most shoes I try feel unconfortable, although I have size 42 (which seems to be a very standard size in Germany for males). What if we could go to a store, let them 3D scan our feet and they automatically adjust a 3D model of a shoe to fit to our feet. Then some parts are 3D printed, assembled and a few days later we get a shoe that is customized to our feet and cheap. continuumfashion.com seems to 3D print shoes with Nylon. kobilevidesign.com is another designer who 3D prints shoes. Toys Board game figures (e.g. custom chess sets, Monopoly cars, ...) Model building (e.g. Ship model where people pay A LOT of money for it) Lego Teaching Did you have chemistry in school and learn about atom models / crystaline structures? With 3D printing, it becomes easy to get those models for every student! Or think about architecture and history. You could show models of ancient cities or buildings in 3D. Spare parts Imagine something small breaks. Sometimes very expensive devices that are otherwise fine, become useless or at least ugly. Now think you could go online, download a 3D model of that part and just print it. Design Lamps Cups Weapons Sadly, 3D printing can also be used to produce weapons ( source ). However, a 3D printed pistol has a high chance of not working at all, of hurting the person that created it and of working. So currently, it's quite a lot of gambling. But that might change when the quality of 3D printing improves.

Don't forget a raincoat warm cloths for the flight And, of course, don't forget towels: Just about the most massively useful thing any interstellar Hitchhiker can carry. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course you can dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have \"lost.\" What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with. Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in \"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.\" more passport document for your health insurance in the US smartphone camera - I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ41 for 260 Euro and 64 GB Flash storage for 32 Euro for this trip. It is worth the money! It is an exceptional camera! laptop chargers power adapters (at least 2!). I can recommend this big adapter . Don't take the small ones! They are very loose. hygiene products (toothbrush, dental floss, dental floss, razor, shaving foam) Overview by time On 10.01.2014 I decided that I would like to go to the US. At 26.04.2014 I got my passport with the visa back. So it took more than 4 months until I could finally be sure that I can go to the US. Keep that in mind! I have written down when I did what (that sounds soo wrong - please correct me if you know how to express that in English). It should help you to plan your trip. Application A first step is the application as described here . A general contact person is Margit Rödder . Get all required documents to OIE After you've got accepted by the interACT advisory board (whoever that is), you have to get a 'bank statement'. These are some lines where your bank confirms that you have enough money to live from when you're in the US. It is very important that this statement is in English. So you should have about 1775 US-Dollar per month on your bank account. This means, if you want to be in the US for 4 months, make sure that you have at least 7100 US-Dollar on your account For customers of 'Sparkasse' this costs 25 Euro and you have to make sure that what you get is in English. For customers of 'comdirect' this costs 10 Euro For customers of 'Volksbank / Raiffeisenbank' this seems to be free. So I gave the bank statement and a copy of my passport to Margit Rödder. Some days later I've received an invitation from my advisor at CMU and some legal stuff I had to sign. I did this and send a copy to Faith Bold. 26.03.2014 All documents are signed and I sent them to Faith. 26.03.2014 Faith submitted the documents to the OIE. Receive documents from OIE 03.04.2014 : Got e-mail from UPS that they got my forms. Nice to know. 07.04.2014 : I've got my forms now (especially DS-2019). It seems as if I have to pay a fee of 180 US-Dollar for SEVIS. There is no refunding possible when I don't get the visa ( source ). And that's not the same as the visa application fee (which is additional 160.00 US-Dollar). So I've paid the SEVIS fee on www.FMJfee.com . You need one of the following credit cards for that step: American Express Diners Club Discover MasterCard Visa DS-160 14.04.2014 : I've filled this form. Address: You can fill in the address of your department (see admission document header) Know your rights video and information Visa and Visiting the U.S. embassy You have to pay here for your visa. Some hints: Your exchange number usually starts with a P SEVIS number is on top of DS-2019 (N....) Some first information: link There is quite a lot of stuff you may not bring to the embassy ( list ) You can see visa wait times online. I had to go to Frankfurt and that were about 2 days. You do not need a DS-7002, because that's only for interns. You're a short-term scholar. See also: Visa interview information Check this checklist: USembassy.gov nonimmigrant documents 23.04.2014 08:20: Although my appointment was scheduled for 9 o'clock, I've been there much earlier. There was a ~20m queue with ~80 people waiting. 08:59: I arrived at the first counter window. This one is outside of the embassy. I had to show my documents, tell the officer which visa I'm going to apply for. He gave me a \"service ticket\". With that ticket I could queue into the \"security check\" queue. That one is also outside of the embassy. I had to remove my belt and my wallet, put it into a plastic bag that I was given. After that, I could enter. Then I put my jacket and the plastic bag into a box that got through a scanner. 09:05: Next I got to a \"welcome desk\". A lady gave me a sheet of paper and told me to arrange the documents listed (and only those documents) there in the right order. It was something like: passport, SEVIS confirmation, photo, DS-160, DS-2019. 09:07: Line up in the next queue *sigh*. 09:30: I gave the officer my documents, she returned the photograph to me (seems as if this is not necessary if you've already uploaded it) and scanned my fingers. 09:35: Line up in the next queue... 09:40: Scan my fingers ... again. 09:45: Line up in the final queue past the \"T\" sign. 09:55: This is the first officer that asked my some questions. The questions were: * Officer: Where do you want to go and what do you want to do there? * Me: I want to go to CMU, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to write my bachelors thesis in computer science. * Officer: Who will pay for your expenses? * Me: I have a scholarship called \"interACT\" and I pay the rest by myself. * Officer: Your visa has been approved. You will receive your passport within one week. That was it. After-VISA-Stuff 26.04.2014 My passport arrived with the visa in it. Now I've contacted about 20 people I found on craigslist asking for a room in Pittsburgh. 27.04.2014 Finding a room to live fro 3 months in Pittsburgh is more difficult than I thought. And finding a room to store my stuff for those 3 months in Karlsruhe is also not so easy. All self-storage services like lager7 , lagerbox.com and deinlagerplatz.de are not in Karlsruhe. But I thought finding a cellar / garage near Karlsruhe for 50 Euro / month or less would be easy ... edit: I finally decided to store most of my stuff at my fathers and sublease the room. That was a good decision. Here are some documents for subleasing. But before you start ask your landlord if you're allowed to sublease! Zwischenmietvertrag Bestätigung Schlüsselübergabe Bestätigung Schlüsselübergabe (zurück) 07.05.2014 An e-mail arrived from \"Baden-Württemberg-Stipendium\" telling me that I now have full access to their material and that I have to sign something and sent it back to them. They also told me that my scholarship is 900 Euro / month for 4 months. Finally some good news! Eventually it will not get as expensive as I thought! Getting the flight tickets I have heard that fluege.de has a very bad service. They seem not to send you the tickets in time (I've heard something about two weeks later!) and they don't show the correct price. There is more information on Wikipedia.de . OneTwoTrip on the other hand had some good reviews 1 2 . Here is a (German) explanation of the booking process: Other online portals are: skyscanner.de has only one rating on ciao.de swoodoo.com is a meta search engine that uses fluege.de billigflieger.de has only 3 ratings on ciao.de and 60 on trustpilot.de expedia.de has 3/5 stars on ciao.de and 1/5 stars on trustpilot.de fluege.de has 2.5/5 stars on ciao.de and 3/5 stars on trustpilot.de cheaptickets.de has very bad critics on Wikipedia (see ciao.de ) but 4/5 stars on trustpilot.de Baggage: united.com IMPORTANT If possible, try not to fly over Chicago! That Airport is HUGE. I had 1.5 hours to get my next flight and I did not manage it. It took me quite a while to realize that you have to get into a train to get to the other terminal. And you have to re-checkin your luggage. That's annoying! (I did not have to do that when I left the US) Preparing and flight 28.05.2014 : I've transferred the money for the flat. All of it. 30.05.2014 : I've went to the German airport in Munich about 2 hours earlier to make sure that I don't miss my flight. We arrived at the correct terminal. First of all, I had to \"give up\" (is it called \"check-in\"?) my luggage. After that, I spend some time with my father. Then, 10 minutes before the \"Board time\" began, I went through the security checkpoint. I had to put my backpack into a plastic box, my large electronic devices into separate ones (because the metal / electronic blocks the rays) and my belt in another one. Make sure you don't have anything in your pockets. After that, you can go through a metal detector. You get checked with a hand held device after that. Next, you have to find your \"gate\". This is the place where you go onto the plane. As soon as I arrived at the correct airport I had to find my luggage. You have to know that there are signs e.g. \"Luggage A-M\". Those letters \"A-M\" refer to the airline (in my case United), not to your name! The next step was to get from airport to the house. As I arrived after 12p.m. I had to go by taxi which cost. Remember: You should give a tip of at least 10%, but rather 15%. Getting into the house was the next step to take. I was really lucky that a neighbor was on the terrace and gave me her phone to call my friend who lives in that house. First impressions 01.06.2014 : We visited a some stores and Dave and Buster's which is a video arcade. 02.06.2014 : I've got to know Jae Cho who now has the job that Faith had before. She introduced me to everybody. After that, I was sent to Jill Lentz. She is in GHC which is short for \"Gates Hillman Center\". \"Gates\" and \"Hillman\" are two buildings that are connected. Jill gave me a form from \"TheHUB\" which is a student service center. I've just ordered a sim card at ultra.me Trip to New York 11.06.2014 : 50.15 Euro for the bus tickets and 94.42 Euro for the hotel. We (Emanuel, David, Damir and me) went to New York by bus. That took quite a while, but it was quite cheap and the bus was comfortable. Not like some of the remote buses in Germany where you don't have any place for yourself. The Royal Park Hotel is very central and very cheap, but I would not recommend it. The smell was disgusting (probably from bug spray?), we had a power blackout once (eventually because 4 people wanted to charge their phones, a laptop, two tables and a camera simultaneously in one room?) and the shower was shared with other rooms. I recommend to visit the central park. It is great! The American Museum of Natural History is ok. You can see something about science and astronomy in the basement and around the Hayden Sphere, but not much. The rest is about stones, people, plants and animals in America. I don't think that mammals are very interesting, so that was pretty boring for me. It has some \"Special Exhibitions\" for which you have to pay in advance if you want to be able to see them. The \"Dark Universe\" special exhibition is probably not worth the money if you have been to a planetarium before. I have seen very similar shows in Augsburg and the movie did not contain information that was new to me. Smoky Quartz Wulfenite Hayden sphere Labradorite Muscovite crystal structure showing cleavage Rosenhof: Green frog dissection There are more images from my trip to New York City on Wikipedia Commons . Brooklyn Bridge is also interesting. You can take some nice pictures there at night: Ground Zero is also a must-see. It is very impressive. It is the biggest human build waterfall: Ground Zero And - of course - liberty island and the statue of liberty. You will also get to Ellis island and the immigrant museum. That was interesting! Money - How much does it cost? You have to pay quite a lot in advance. I'm my case, it were 3218.06 Euro: bank statement : 25 Euro SEVIS fee : 180 US-Dollar = 131.45 Euro + 1.97 Euro \"ENTGELD AUSLAND\" VISA application fee : 160.00 US-Dollar = 116.70 Euro 2 photos for J1 visa : 15.00 Euro traveling to Frankfurt for Visa application : 2.30 Euro + 6.00 Euro + 8.00 Euro = 16.30 Euro Stay one day in Frankfurt : 59.00 Euro passport : 37.50 Euro health insurance : 102.72 Euro casualty insurance : 13.44 Euro Flight tickets : 961.62 Euro luggage scale \"Soehnle 66172\" : 16.99 Euro power adapter USA2Schuko : 4.49 Euro rent for 3 months : 1715.88 Euro I arrived in the US with 2000 US-Dollar in traveler checks and 200 US-Dollar in cash. I payed 1451.68 Euro for the traveler checks and 151.63 Euro for the cash. My VISA-card expenses were 338.31 Euro. I had to transfer 144.57 Euro to friends who payed the trip to New York in advance.

I'm not sure if that is actually the case, but that doesn't matter for the idea I want to explain. That means one tutor helps one student only. That must be incredibly effective for learning. From my experience as a tutor and as a \"coach\" (Nachhilfelehrer) I know that there is a huge difference in One-on-One tutoring compared to One-on-Many tutoring, where one tutor teaches about 30 students. If you only have one student, you can focus on the needs of this single student. And I guess that the student will also be encouraged a bit more to participate. If you only have one student, the student will not sleep while you teach him. He has to stay focused, because you will notice when he doesn't. So One-on-One tutoring is something we want to get. The problem of One-on-One tutoring It is expensive, if it would be done like tutoring is currently done. In fact I think it would be impossible, because you would not find that many tutors. However, I think there are other ways to motivate students that have already passed the exam to be a tutor for another student. How to get One-on-One tutoring Give One-on-One tutors the possibility to write the exam again and improve their grade. I could imagine it to work like this: A student passes the exam, but he does not have the grade he wants. As he has already passed the exam, he will not be allowed to simply write it again. So he has to search a student who hasn't already passed the exam and help this student to prepare for the exam. Now we have to check if the One-on-One tutor really helped the new student. I could imagine two ways that could also be combined. One-on-One tutoring: Way 1 The One-on-One tutor has to help the new student with the exercises. So the One-on-Many tutor gets the information which exercises were done by the One-on-One tutor and the new student. In contrast to now, not only one student would exercise, but two. In order to make sure that there is an improvement, one could increase the necessary number of points for the One-on-One tutor to a threshold of \\(\\theta_1\\) . \\(\\theta_1\\) should denote how much more points the student needs (in percent of the points the students need) to get the possibility to re-do the exam. \\(\\theta_1 = 0\\) would mean that the tutor does only need a student who gets the minimum number of points to pass the exam. \\(\\theta_1 = 1\\) would mean that the tutor needs his students to get double the number of points in the exercises than what he would need to be allowed to participate in the exam. This means \\(\\theta_1 \\in [0, 1]\\) . \\(\\theta_1\\) should not be zero, because that would mean that 1-on-1 tutors could choose their students right before the exam. But I want them to choose the student at the beginning of the semester. And \\(\\theta_1\\) may not be too high. The higher it gets, the more difficult and time intensive it gets for the student and the tutor. I think the time right before an exam is the time where students learn most. If a student doesn't achieve the \\(\\theta_1\\) threshold, then the tutor will not have any incentive to help the student to prepare for the exam except for money or friendship. This is a good incentive for the student to keep working on excercises, even if he already got enough points to be allowed to write the exam. One-on-One tutoring: Way 2 The other possibility would be to enforce a minimum grade for the tutored student. So the One-on-One tutor cannot participate in the same exam as his student, but in the exam after that. And the tutor can only participate in that exam if his student got a minimum grade \\(\\theta_2\\) , e.g. 2.3 or better. \\(\\theta_2 = 5\\) would mean that the student only has to participate in the exam (at KIT every student gets at least a grade of 5. The best grade is 1.0.). \\(\\theta_2 = 1\\) would mean that the student has to pass with the best grade so that the tutor is allowed to participate in the exam. Alternatively one could make that dependent on the number of students who got the grade. So \\(\\theta_2 = 10\\%\\) would mean that you choose the grade threshold in a way that makes sure that at least 10% of all students pass that requirement. This means \\(\\theta_2 \\in [1, 5]\\) or \\(\\theta_2 \\in (0\\%, 100\\%]\\) . \\(\\theta_2\\) should not be too bad (near 5), because then it will be too easy for many students to get another try for the exam. That would also not help the students, because the tutor would not have an incentive that is strong enough to increase the abilities of his student. However, if \\(\\theta_2\\) gets too low (near 1.0) then most students will not try to be a tutor because it is too difficult to get a student to achieve that good results. How to speak about it I would like to call this model MOOT (Martins One-on-One Tutoring model ☺ ). It is parameterized with two variables, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) . I think \\(MOOT(\\theta_1=0.2, \\theta_2=25\\%)\\) would be a good possibility to encourage students to help other students effectively. \\(\\theta_1\\) is low enough to make it fairly easy for somebody who already passed the exam to \"lift\" a student to pass the requirement. So I guess \\(MOOT(0.2, 25\\%)\\) would be a good choice. You could still argue that the tutor could simply write the excercises himself. But I don't think that would be a problem, because then the tutor would do the excercises. He would still practice. We only get a problem if larger groups of students copy excercises. I don't think that is the case, but I judge from the students I know. I might have a biased view on the problem. Conclusion The two ways I proposed would in general lead to better students, remove stress from students because a single bad exam would not be that bad any more and very likely lead to better students. Students would be better on the paper (because the tutor should only be able to improve himself by the new exam and also his student should be able to achieve better results in the exam) and in the real world. Students would get an incentive to repeat what they did not understand before. They would get an incentive to help other students. For free. And it would not be that much more work for the university. I think it is easier to correct exams of good students and only a few would really take this possibility as it is really time intensive for the One-on-One tutor. But for some exams and some students that might be worth the effort. What do you think about it? Do you think we could introduce that model at KIT? Who could propose it? To whom should it be proposed? Other incentives If writing the exam again is not an option, we could try to find other incentives for tutors: Getting \"exclusive\" rights: Visiting CERN or something similar Getting access to equipment of the university (executing your personal projects on KIT clusters, getting access to microscopes, being allowed to use lecture halls) \"Proud\" of the unversity: If we could make KIT students being proud of being a student at KIT the students themselves could want to support fellow students. I am not sure if there is any incentive which is strong enough to support another student for one semester. Do you have an idea?

The video is about the automatic creation of hyperlapse videos: We present a method for converting first-person videos, for example, captured with a helmet camera during activities such as rock climbing or bicycling, into hyperlapse videos: time-lapse videos with a smoothly moving camera. So we are now only speaking about first-person videos. As videos created by a helmet camera might be very long and (as he accurately described it) \"dead boring\", you want to speed that up. A timelaps would be a subsampling to every n-th frame. Those might be very shaky and hard to watch. That means you would at least want some image stabilization. Microsoft Hyperlapse But the software they created does more. Much more. Reconstruction First, it reconstructs the geometry of the captured environment. That alone is absolutely awesome. They apply a group of techniques called structure from motion . Path planning Then they plan the path of the camera. This is a 6-dimensional problem for every point in time where you want to get an image. The 6 dimensions are: (x, y, z): Position of the camera roll: horizontal, vertical angle pitch: up, down view angle yaw: left, right view angle In case you have a problem with imagining roll, pitch and yaw you should take a look at the following image: Roll, pitch and yaw By [ZeroOne](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_dynamics_with_text.png) The chosen path should meet several criteria: It should be smooth in space Every path position should be close to input positions The path should be short Rotation should be smooth (that is what makes videos \"shaky\") The rendering quality should be as high as possible The first 3 steps were achived by spline fitting.

This article should give a very short summary how it came to this discussion. Timeline 25. July 2014 : Straw poll in the German Wiki began ( link ) 08.

August 2014 : The Admins DaB. , Raymond and JEissfeldt (WMF) repeatedly change MediaWiki:Common.js to activate / deactivate the MediaViewer for the German wiki 10. August 2014 : Superprotect got introduced and Erik Möller ( User:Eloquence ) protected MediaWiki:Common.js. The MediaViewer You can try the MediaViewer to get a feeling what this is all about. You can view some images of the MediaViewer here: Article First click on image with MediaViewer First click on image without MediaViewer notes to the MediaViewer interface MediaViewer Bottom 'Tab' MediaViewer 'Use this file' There has been a survey that suggests that 60% of all users like the MediaViewer ( source ). However, there are concerns that the survey was biased ( source ). You should know that you can easily disable the MediaViewer if you have an account: Preferences → Appearance → Files = uncheck 'Enable Media Viewer' The question is: Should the MediaViewer be activated per default? Pro Average users want to see the image in a higher resolution. The MediaViewer looks more professional than the old view. Wrong arguments The copyright notice doesn't get in my way. It is a legal obligation to show the copyright notice. Contra The MediaViewer doesn't give new functionality: One could see high-resolution images before by simply clicking a second time on the image. The MediaViewer makes it more difficult for new users to edit file descriptions. The MediaViewer hides information like the copyright status. Charts and maps that are color-coded and change/are edited over time and have a legend/key in multiple languages simply do not work with this interface. See this example . The MediaViewer makes browsing difficult on touch-screen devices that use pinch-to-zoom. It becomes almost unusably slow on slower machines or machines on a slow connection. MediaViewer makes it more difficult to find the image in the highest resolution. Wrong arguments It's in the way of long-term wikipedia editors. This argument is wrong, because long-term wikipedia editors can simply disable it. They should know how to do it. Logged in in users don't need this feature. Again, they can disable it. Good comments The default setting for logged-in users should be the same as for unregistered users, so that new users have fewer surprises to deal with. Alternatives to default-enable MediaViewer Change from opt-out to opt-in Disabled for current users and enabled for newly registered users Superprotect The German Wikipedia community decided to disable MediaViewer per default. As the MediaViewer got rolled out, some admins in the German Wikipedia enabled / disabled it (see version history of Common.js ). This was the reason to create superprotect: Add a new protection level called \"superprotect\" Assigned to nobody by default. Requested by Erik Möller for the purposes of protecting pages such that sysop permissions are not sufficient to edit them. Change-Id: Idfa211257dbacc7623d42393257de1525ff01e9e Source: gerrit.wikimedia.org That started another community poll in the German wiki: Wikipedia:Umfragen/Superschutz and Wikipedia:Meinungsbilder/Gruppenrecht Superschutz Now the question is: Should the new group right 'super protect' be kept? Pro Super protect is a necessary tool to temporarily prevent abuse of admin powers in heated discussions. The WMF has the legal right to do what they want on wikipedia.org. The WMF controls the technical details of the Wikipedia platform, whereas the community only controls the content. Wrong arguments The super protect right was necessary as one admin was abusing his power. If the problem is only one admin, there already is the possibility to remove the admin status of this user. The WMF has the legal right to do what they want and they need superprotect to have legal security. That is simply wrong. There is (currently) no case where an admin tried to put something illegal on Wikipedia.org and abused his admin rights to keep it there. Contra There is no need for such a tool, as the community is able to solve 'wheel wars'. In case of the abuse of powers by admins, these powers can be removed (see Review and removal of adminship ) The community wants to organize Wikipedia by themselves without intervention from the WMF. The problem for many users seems to be that the WMF is not elected, whereas admins are (see Wikipedia:Administrators#Becoming_an_administrator - there seem to be differences in the English / German Wiki). The new concept of 'super protection' was introduced too fast without a concept which was discussed within the community. The risk of misuse of power is too high as there is no mutual control. Comments I think super protect might be a good solution to temporarily freeze pages when more than two admins have a wheel war. In that case it could be implemented so that it can only freeze a page for 7 days and after those 7 days the page cannot be frozen for at least 14 days (one would have to discuss the numbers). This way, it can be a tool for de-escalation and the abuse can be limited. Also, sites that get frozen must have at least two back-and-forth edits by two admins and the community must have voted for freezing.

But this is a bad idea when you upload the code to GitHub. I will explain some alternatives I got to know for Python. Python Configuration File The simplest way to write configuration files is to simply write a separate file that contains Python code. You might want to call it something like databaseconfig.py . Then you could add the line *config.py to your .gitignore file to avoid uploading it accidentally. A configuration file could look like this: #!/usr/bin/env python import preprocessing mysql = { 'host' : 'localhost' , 'user' : 'root' , 'passwd' : 'my secret password' , 'db' : 'write-math' } preprocessing_queue = [ preprocessing . scale_and_center , preprocessing . dot_reduction , preprocessing . connect_lines ] use_anonymous = True Within the actual code, you can use it like this: #!/usr/bin/env python import databaseconfig as cfg connect ( cfg . mysql [ 'host' ], cfg . mysql [ 'user' ], cfg . mysql [ 'password' ]) The way you include the configuration might feel very convenient at a first glance, but imagine what happens when you get more configuration variables. You definitely need to provide an example configuration file. And it is hard to resist the temptation to include code within the configuration file. JSON JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. It is widespread and thus has good support for many programming languages. The configuration might look like this: { \"mysql\" :{ \"host\" : \"localhost\" , \"user\" : \"root\" , \"passwd\" : \"my secret password\" , \"db\" : \"write-math\" }, \"other\" :{ \"preprocessing_queue\" :[ \"preprocessing.scale_and_center\" , \"preprocessing.dot_reduction\" , \"preprocessing.connect_lines\" ], \"use_anonymous\" : true } } You can read it like this: import json with open ( 'config.json' ) as json_data_file : data = json . load ( json_data_file ) print ( data ) which outputs { u 'mysql' : { u 'db' : u 'write-math' , u 'host' : u 'localhost' , u 'passwd' : u 'my secret password' , u 'user' : u 'root' }, u 'other' : { u 'preprocessing_queue' : [ u 'preprocessing.scale_and_center' , u 'preprocessing.dot_reduction' , u 'preprocessing.connect_lines' ], u 'use_anonymous' : True }} Writing JSON files is also easy. Just build up the dictionary and use import json with open ( 'config.json' , 'w' ) as outfile : json . dump ( data , outfile ) YAML YAML is a configuration file format. Wikipedia says: YAML (rhymes with camel) is a human-readable data serialization format that takes concepts from programming languages such as C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from XML and the data format of electronic mail (RFC 2822). YAML was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, who designed it together with Ingy döt Net and Oren Ben-Kiki. It is available for several programming languages. The file itself might look like this: mysql : host : localhost user : root passwd : my secret password db : write-math other : preprocessing_queue : - preprocessing.scale_and_center - preprocessing.dot_reduction - preprocessing.connect_lines use_anonymous : yes You can read it like this: import yaml with open ( \"config.yml\" , 'r' ) as ymlfile : cfg = yaml . load ( ymlfile ) for section in cfg : print ( section ) print ( cfg [ 'mysql' ]) print ( cfg [ 'other' ]) It outputs: other mysql { 'passwd' : 'my secret password' , 'host' : 'localhost' , 'db' : 'write-math' , 'user' : 'root' } { 'preprocessing_queue' : [ 'preprocessing.scale_and_center' , 'preprocessing.dot_reduction' , 'preprocessing.connect_lines' ], 'use_anonymous' : True } There is a yaml.dump method, so you can write the configuration the same way. Just build up a dictionary. YAML is used by the Blender project.

However, parsing / writing XML is easy and there are plenty of possibilities to do so with Python. One is BeautifulSoup: from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup with open ( \"config.xml\" ) as f : content = f . read () y = BeautifulSoup ( content ) print ( y . mysql . host . contents [ 0 ]) for tag in y . other . preprocessing_queue : print ( tag ) where the config.xml might look like this: <config> <mysql> <host> localhost </host> <user> root </user> <passwd> my secret password </passwd> <db> write-math </db> </mysql> <other> <preprocessing_queue> <li> preprocessing.scale_and_center </li> <li> preprocessing.dot_reduction </li> <li> preprocessing.connect_lines </li> </preprocessing_queue> <use_anonymous value= \"true\" /> </other> </config> File Endings File Endings give the user and the system an indicator about the content of a file. Reasonable file endings for configuration files are *config.py for Python files *.yaml or *.yml if the configuration is done in YAML format *.json for configuration files written in JSON format *.cfg or *.conf to indicate that it is a configuration file *.ini for \"initialization\" are quite widespread (see Wiki ) ~/.[my_app_name]rc is a VERY common naming scheme for configuration files on Linux systems. RC is a reference to an old computer system and means \"run common\". That said, I think I prefer *.conf . I think it is a choice that users understand. But you might also consider that *.ini might get opened by standard in a text editor. For the other options, users might get asked which program they want to use.

It is dynamically typed. Installation Octave is in the package repositories, so it can be installed by $ sudo apt-get install octave gnuplot-x11 octave-epstk and started with $ octave Configuration Create a file ~/.octaverc in your home folder. Write PS1('>>'); setenv(\"GNUTERM\",\"x11\"); in it to get a nicer prompt and make sure that plots will work. The Language Vectors and Matrices Octave has a lot of neat matrix manipulation features. You can create a matrix \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2\\\\ 3 & 4\\end{pmatrix} \\) with >> A = [ 1 2 ; 3 4 ]; When you want to transpose a vector / a matrix, you simply add an apostrophe: >> A = [ 1 2 ; 3 4 ]; >> A ' ans = 1 3 2 4 You can multiply two matrices with A*B or use the dot product with A .* B . The identity matrix \\(I \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) can be created with >> I = eye ( n ); You can get a part of the matrix by slicing: >> I = eye ( n ); >> I (:, 1 : 2 ); But be careful: Vectors and matrices are 1-indexed, not 0-indexed as you might expect! You can get the size of a matrix with the function size which returns a matrix: >> a = [ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6 ]; >> size ( a ) ans = 2 3 If you simple want the \"length\" you can directly access the first element: >> size ( a )( 1 ) ans = 2 Sequences The sequence 0 1 2 3 4 5 can be created with [0:5] . The sequence 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 can be created with [0.2:0.1:0.5] . In general: [<start>:<step>:<end>] where <start> and <end> are included. You can also very simple apply functions to each element: >> t = [ 0.2 : 0.1 : 0.5 ]; >> sin ( t ) ans = 0.19867 0.29552 0.38942 0.47943 The output can be suppressed with ; . Plotting I have never seen a language where plotting is so easy: >> x = [ 0 : 0.01 : pi ]; >> y = sin ( x ); >> plot ( x , y ); You can add labels and a legend to it, too: >> xlabel = \"x\" ; >> ylabel = \"value\" ; >> legend ( 'sin' , 'cos' ) >> title ( \"sin and cos\" ) And finally, you can store the image: print - dpng 'my_plot.png' Control statements for for i = 1 : 10 ; printf ( \"%i: %i\\n\" , i , i &#94; 2 ) end while i = 1 ; while i < = 10 , printf ( \"%i: %i\\n\" , i , i &#94; 2 ) end ; if if 2 == 1 + 1 , printf ( \"True\\n\" ); elseif 3 == 2 + 1 , printf ( \"Else true\" ); else printf ( \"else\" ); end ; Functions Functions have to be saved in a file called [filename].m . One other special thing about functions is that you define the variable with the output at the beginning: function y = fibonacci ( n ) if n < 2 , y = 1 ; else y = fibonacci ( n - 1 ) + fibonacci ( n - 2 ); end ; You can also group values you want to give back like this: function [succ, pred] = succ_and_pred ( n ) succ = n + 1 ; pred = n - 1 ; Resources GNU Octave stackoverflow.com Documentation","tags":"Code","title":"Introduction to Octave"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/fix-zypper-readline-error/","text":"In case you work on a openSUSE system and you get the following error $ zypper zypper: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libreadline.so.6: undefined symbol: PC you can probably \"fix\" it by setting the 64 Bit LD_LIBRARY like this: $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /lib64: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH It worked for me on openSUSE 12.1 \"Asparagus\".

This file format is sometimes also called ICSI feature file archive format. But this file format cannot be used for ASR only, but also for many other ML tasks. The file consists of a fixed length ascii header followed by zero or more variable length binary sections. Each parameter in the header has a name and a list of zero or more value strings. The programmer's interface to pfiles (see param.h and pfile.h) allows each parameter value to be interpreted as integer, float, string, arrays, distributed vector, matrix, mapping tables, etc. Some special parameter names are associated with a section in the binary part of the pfile. The value strings for these parameters give the size and offset (from the end of the header) of the binary section. A binary section can be used as a one dimensional sequence of values, or as a sequence of fixed length rows in a two dimensional matrix. Some parameters are automatically added by the pfile command. For example, pfile_header is a parameter that contains the length and version number of the header.

Some of them act unexpectedly intelligent due to recent improvements in processing speed (hardware) and neural nets (computer science) as well as good application of differential equations (mathematics). Differential equations are mathematical equations with a function and its derivative. So a simple differential equation is \\(f(x) = f'(x)\\) . They are commonly used in physics, because you often have functions that have time as their argument. A simple example would be the growth of a population in biology (see Differential Equations: some simple examples from Physclips ). Cubli The Cubli is a 15 × 15 × 15 cm cube that can jump up and balance on its corner. Reaction wheels mounted on three faces of the cube rotate at high angular velocities and then brake suddenly, causing the Cubli to jump up. Once the Cubli has almost reached the corner stand up position, controlled motor torques are applied to make it balance on its corner. In addition to balancing, the motor torques can also be used to achieve a controlled fall such that the Cubli can be commanded to fall in any arbitrary direction. Combining these three abilities -- jumping up, balancing, and controlled falling -- the Cubli is able to 'walk'. Quadcopters by Raffaello D'Andrea In a robot lab at TEDGlobal, Raffaello D'Andrea demos his flying quadcopters: robots that think like athletes, solving physical problems with algorithms that help them learn.

The MNIST format MNIST comes in 4 files ( download here ): train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: training set images (9.45 MB, 60000 instances) train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: training set labels (28.2 kB, 60000 labels) t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz: test set images (1.57 MB, 10000 instances) t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz: test set labels (4.43 kB, 10000 labels) Both label files are like this: [offset] [type] [value] [description] 0000 32 bit integer 0x00000801(2049) magic number (MSB first) 0004 32 bit integer 60000 number of items 0008 unsigned byte ?? label 0009 unsigned byte ?? label ........ xxxx unsigned byte ?? label The labels values are 0 to 9. and both image containers are like that: [offset] [type] [value] [description] 0000 32 bit integer 0x00000803(2051) magic number 0004 32 bit integer 60000 number of images 0008 32 bit integer 28 number of rows 0012 32 bit integer 28 number of columns 0016 unsigned byte ?? pixel 0017 unsigned byte ?? pixel ........ xxxx unsigned byte ?? pixel And they are, of course, compressed. Reading the dataset Python brings all necessary tools to make it easy to read the dataset: gzip : A library for reading gzipped files unpack to read the packed binary data As the training and the testing dataset is structured the same way, we can create a method thad retrives the data for both files. from struct import unpack import gzip from numpy import zeros , uint8 , float32 def get_labeled_data ( imagefile , labelfile ): \"\"\"Read input-vector (image) and target class (label, 0-9) and return it as list of tuples. \"\"\" # Open the images with gzip in read binary mode images = gzip . open ( imagefile , 'rb' ) labels = gzip . open ( labelfile , 'rb' ) # Read the binary data # We have to get big endian unsigned int.

One way to store information is via BibTeX files. BibTeX is a reference management software that is used together with LaTeX. If you're new to BibTeX or references in LaTeX in general you could read the followin articles: bibtex vs. biber and biblatex vs. natbib What is the difference between bibtex and biblatex? - I keep forgetting that all the time. I've tried to create a MWE for biblatex , but as I don't really know much about BibTeX it's probably not the best resource to start with. A longer working example of BibTeX is my bachelors thesis (work is still in (slow) progress). What is JabRef? JabRef is a reference management software that uses BibTeX as its native format. It looks like this: JabRef How can I get it? JabRef 2.10 beta is part of the Debian sources. Thus it can be installed by sudo apt-get install jabref The official development page is jabref.sourceforge.net . As it is written in Java it can be installed on all (or at least most) systems where you have a JVM (thus: good news Windows / Mac users!). What's good about JabRef? You can easily add the information where the PDF is located on your system and open the PDF directly via JabRef: Adding PDF with JabRef This is especially powerfull with the search. As you can add quite a lot of information to the entries (such as the abstract and comments) and searching that is faster / easier than searching folders of PDFs, it's very convenient to use JabRef for opening your PDFs: Searching with JabRef The preview also helps you to see how it might appear in your document: JabRef preview Another nice feature is the autocompletion of authors names and titles. What could be better? It would be neat if you could automatically upload your BibTeX file and use other peoples BibTeX files to complete the information or to get informed of possible errors in your database. Additionally, a good PDF reader that is fast and allows annotations of which JabRef would be aware would be awesome. Speed is quite often an issue with Java applications in my experience. It takes about 5 seconds to open my BibTeX file of about 37 references. After starting that it's ok. Shortcuts are important for tools that get used often, too. Although JabRef has some reasonable shortcuts like Ctr + i for importing a BibTeX file and Ctr + s for saving the current BibTeX file, I miss Ctrl + f for searching the database. Importing other BibTeX files into the current BibTeX file is possible. But I would also like to \"import\" BibTeX data by copy and pasting a single dataset. Alternatives Mendeley is a closed-source alternative with a built-in PDF reader. It seems to be fast and can complete information when the title is given.","tags":"Science","title":"Reference Management with JabRef"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/discussions-with-friends/","text":"I've recently had a very interesting discussion with some friends. We talked about a lot of stuff and I don't want to go into detail about the topics we've discussed, but rather some thoughts about discussions. Types of discussions There are many ways people talk to each other: Small Talk is about being together and feeling fine. We do it when we are together waiting for something or just because it feels good. It's not so much about content which show discussions about weather, fashion or sitcoms, although the amount of information you exchange varies quite a lot. Feelings and talking about feelings is difficult, but important. Although I tend to say it's like small talk, but I don't want to go into detail here. Teaching is a situation where one person knows more than another person in some topic he (or she) teaches the other. Learning is either the other side in the teaching situation or learning together. I think it is fundamentally different and deserves an own bullet point because in the teaching situation, the teacher leads the conversation. In the learning situation you don't have somebody who leads the conversation. It's a free flow of (hopefully) constructive thoughts with the aim to get a new ability as a group. Moral or Political Discussions are some sort of learning, but in contrast to learning in the sense that you get another ability or get to know some more facts, the aim is on evaluating how to weight those facts. Discussions involve a learning part, but the core is about putting things together. So it is not mainly about what could be done but what should be done and for what reasons. What's special about discussions? Discussions involve some aim. That aim might be What is the best way to explain XYZ? What does best mean in this context? What should we do in situation ABC? What is to consider for what reasons? But very much of the conversations that are labeled as \"discussions\" feel rather like small talk for the following reasons: I think to have a meaningful discussion you need to have a partner who is not of your opinion. For political discussions this means the following are NOT meaningful statements: I want everybody to be able to find a job (or shorter: Fight unemployment) I want to make less dept I want everybody to be able to live a healthy live I want to help families I want everybody to be happy All these three statements are statements that everybody could agree with. But you get reasonable statements when you tell how to do so. You can also talk about the \"order\": I want to make less dept, but when young families have to pay more than 20 Euro per year more it is not acceptable. Of course, that's still much to vague, but I think you get the point. Telling what you value might help people to intuitively decide with which person they could rather identify, but it is not enough to name reasons. Another important part of a meaningful discussion is that it should in theory be possible to change the mind of the other person. This is the reason why I've called it \"discussions with friends\". In contrast to the truth-finding \"discussions\" you have in science, you don't need to be able to say what observations could falsify your theory. But if you go into a discussion and you know that it is impossible that the other - no matter how good he makes his point - convinces you of his opinion, you're actually not having a discussion. You try to teach them. (And it's a bad type of teaching.) Techniques to take most out of discussions It is difficult to be open minded in a good discussion. You might need to end a discussion and think through it some time after you had it. Because we tend to defend a point of view when we begin to defend it, no matter how good the other makes his point. It is very difficult to honestly say: Yes, you're correct. That changes the case and probably my opinion. And you should not say so too fast. Some people are charismatic, some can speak or write very good. When you hear a new argument the first time, you might have difficulties to find a correct counter argument. But when you're with friends you should be able to say: That's the first time I've heard that. I have to think about it. or something like I've never seen it from that perspective. People like to teach and this makes them feel more comfortable discussing with you. You don't give up your opinion with statements like these, but it's simply being honest. Speaking of honesty, there is a similar DON'T: Don't say something like Yes, I agree with you, but [Whatever he just said negated] I hear this so often in political debates by amateurs who have read something about discussions. By agreeing you make it easier for your discussion partner to agree with you (he can't disagree when you agree with him, can he?), but it should be a honest way to agree. It's a very bad step to fake agreement. Group dynamics Always - and that's not only related to discussions - try to think what and how the other thinks. Sometimes when a group discusses, a single person get's isolated and has to defend his point of view alone. That's ok. But don't make it worse for him: Give him enough time to think and to talk. Only one person and argument at a time. It's difficult to switch and to concentrate on two (or even more) separate discussions. Try to support him when he has trouble with finding the correct words or the best way to express himself. It is difficult to tell when you simply have to wait and give him some time to think and when you should try to support him. Know when you're wrong Changing opinions is difficult. Especially if you have them for a long time or when you've already defended them. It's a little bit like an investment. When you've already spend 6,000 Euro for an investment and there is a tiny chance that you will get what you want but a growing chance that the investment was just a bad idea and probability suggest to change the investment and rescue what's left, most people will not do so. Somehow we quite often tend to a all-or-nothing thinking which is suboptimal in many cases. So, what can we do so to figure that out for ourselves? Sometimes it is impossible to do so while discussing, but after the discussion you can think about it: What arguments did I tell the others? How did I tell them? What were counter arguments? Are they valid? If so / not: Why? Are there arguments I've missed? Do I feel comfortable with my arguments? Why do I think they could be weak? What do I think are strong arguments? Do others also think that those arguments are strong? If you're not sure about it, you can continue it. It should not be a simple repetition of arguments, but a new discussion with a new structure of arguments. If you're still not sure after many arguments, you can make a pro / contra list. Please note: It's not important what the majority thinks. However, it might be an indicator. Some arguments might simply be wrong. But don't make this choice too easily. Some arguments might be irrelevant. I tend to think \"How does this impact my life?\". If an argument has no impact or simply assumes an unrealistic situation, it might be irrelevant. You don't have to agree at the end. A honest disagreement where both sides understand the arguments of the other side is much better than a comprise that no side really thinks is good. And I want to note that discussions might have many equally valid answers, whereas science has only one correct answer (which might be difficult to find / almost impossible to decide which thesis is correct, but there is only one).","tags":"My bits and bytes","title":"Discussions with friends"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/html5-template/","text":"Once in a while I need to create simple HTML pages.

Dabei war ich mir relativ sicher, mich sogar am ersten Tag angemeldet zu haben, als die Anmeldung freigeschaltet wurde. Meiner Meinung nach sind wir Studenten hier in einer ungerechtfertigt schlechten Position: Sollte tatsächlich ein Fehler passiert sein und meine Anmeldung nicht funktioniert haben bzw. die Anmeldung (wie oder warum auch immer) rückgängig gemacht worden sein, habe ich keinerlei Möglichkeit zu beweisen, dass ich angemeldet war und nicht etwa es einfach vergessen habe. Was ich in meinem konkreten Fall nicht ausschließen will, schließlich ist das schon zwei Monate her und ich habe mich für einige Prüfungen angemeldet und keine automatische Bestätigung der Anmeldung erhalten. Verbesserungsvorschlag Kurz und gut: Ich will, dass die Uni ein digitales Signaturverfahren einsetzt und die technischen Möglichkeiten nutzt, um den Studenten zu helfen ihre Rechte durchzusetzen. Wie das genau funktionieren soll, wird im Folgenden erklärt. Ausführlich Zur Verbesserung dieser Situation schlage ich folgendes vor: Studenten sollen die Möglichkeit bekommen, einen öffentlichen Schlüssel hochzuladen: Einen Schlüssel hinzufügen Einen Schlüssel hinzufügen Mit diesem signieren sie Prüfungsanmeldungen: Prüfungsanmeldung signieren Bei jeder Prüfungsanmeldung soll innerhalb von 24h eine E-Mail in Textform (keine PDF) an u****@student.kit.edu, also die KIT E-Mail-Adresse des Studenten, geschickt werden, der sich angemeldet hat. Diese E-Mail soll folgendes beinhalten: Alle Prüfungen (mit Name, Termin der Prüfung, letzter An- und Abmeldetermin), zu den der Student angemeldet ist. Der volle Name und die Matrikelnummer des Studenten. Das Datum der E-Mail. Diese E-Mail soll mit einem offiziellen KIT Schlüssel signiert werden. Dies könnte z.B. mit PGP gemacht werden und würde dann etwa so aussehen: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Student: Martin Thoma (Matrikelnummer: 1612345) Zeitpunkt: 08.04.2014, 12:34:56 Uhr Angemeldete Prüfungen: Programmierparadigmen (Prüfungstermin: 10.04.2014; letzter Termin der Anmeldung: 31.03.2014; letzer Termin der Abmeldung: 08.04.2014) Kognitive Systeme (Prüfungstermin: 11.04.2014; letzter Termin der Anmeldung: 15.03.2014; letzer Termin der Abmeldung: 10.04.2014) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.14 (GNU/Linux) iEYEARECAAYFAlNDzBoACgkQO3Q6GUuCW82z+ACfamkVC/S8HIpASH8F0ZGVbVW1 rgwAn2cRvNeDN3pZVTpvNWV1vYK9f1fI =3DvZU7 -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- Der Student sollte jederzeit die Möglichkeit haben, eine wie oben beschriebene signierte E-Mail mit der Liste der Prüfungen und einem Datum zu erhalten. Nun sollen Studenten in der Klausur die Möglichkeit haben, diese E-Mail auf einem USB-Stick mitzubringen. Die Aufsicht müsste also einen Computer haben, mit dem sie die E-Mail anschauen und insbesondere die Signatur überprüfen können. So könnte ein Student, der einmal zu einer Klausur angemeldet das auch belegen. Abmeldungen Die auf den ersten Blick sehr schöne Lösung hat einen wichtigen Schönheitsfehler: Studenten können sich von Prüfungen abmelden. Daher ist es möglich, dass ein Student eine signierte E-Mail hat, die ihm die Anmeldung zur Prüfung bestätigt, er aber dennoch nicht zur Prüfung angemeldet ist, da er sich abgemeldet hat. Deshalb wäre es nötig, dass jeder Student ein eigenes Schlüsselpaar aus einem öffentlichen und einem privaten Schlüssel erstellt. Wenn sich ein Student von der Prüfung abmeldet, bekommt er einen Text, z. B. etwas in dieser Richtung: Ich, Martin Thoma (Matrikelnummer: 1612345), melde mich hiermit am 08.04.2014 um 12:34:56 Uhr von der Prüfung \"Programmierparadigmen\" (Prüfungsdatum: 10.04.2014) ab. Diese muss er mit seinem privaten Schlüssel signieren. Die Uni muss daher den öffentlichen Schlüssel des Studenten kennen und diesem zugeordnet haben. Sobald die Abmeldung eingegangen ist, wird innerhalb von 24h eine Bestätigung an den Studenten verschickt, die von der oben beschriebenen Form ist. oder auch eine Fehlermitteilung: Sehr geehrter Herr Thoma, die Signatur ihrer Nachricht war ungültig. Bitte überprüfen Sie, ob Sie den korrekten privaten Schlüssel verwendet haben. Nun hätte auch die Klausuraufsicht die Möglichkeit zu belegen, dass ein Student sich von der Prüfung abgemeldet hat. Technik-Afinität Was ist mit Studenten, die es nicht schaffen ein Schlüsselpaar zu erzeugen bzw. eine Nachricht zu signieren? Nun, das ist einfach: Wer keinen öffentlichen Schlüssel hinterlegt, bekommt auch keine signierten Nachrichten. Dennoch sollten diese Studenten die E-Mails, wie sie oben beschrieben wurden, bekommen. Dann weiß man als Student, dass vermutlich alles mit der Anmeldung geklappt hat bzw. wenn die E-Mail nicht kommt, dass etwas nicht geklappt hat. Bevor also die erste signierte E-Mail der Uni an den Studenten geschrieben wird, muss der Student seinen öffentlichen Schlüssel der Uni mitgeteilt haben und eine Nachricht mit dem privaten Schlüssel signiert haben. Damit wird sichergestellt, dass der Student prinzipiell in der Lage ist sich von Prüfungen abzumelden. Student verliert Schlüssel Was macht man, wenn ein Student einmal einen Schlüssel eingericht hat, diesen aber verliert? Was passiert, wenn man seinen Studentenausweis verliert? Ich denke die Vorgehensweise wäre dann ähnlich. Vorstellbar wäre etwas in der Art: Der Student muss zum Studienbüro und Schriftlich bestätigen, dass der öffentliche Schlüssel aus dem KIT-System entfernt wird und damit ungültig wird. Der Student muss sich bei allen Professoren persönlich melden und unterschreiben, wenn er sich von der Klausur abmelden will. PGP - Was ist das? Siehe Wikpedia . Es ist für folgende Systeme verfügbar: Linux, siehe z.B. Ubuntu mit GnuPG Windows, siehe z.B. GPG4Win Mac, siehe z.B. Mac GNU Privacy Guard Eine weitere Erklärung ist im Piratenwiki . Einfügen ins System Die Website wechall.net bietet die Möglichkeit, einen PGP-Schlüssel hochzuladen. Sobald man das gemacht hat, werden dort alle Nachrichten mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel verschlüsselt. Der Quellcode der Seite ist hier verfügbar. Mit PHP scheint das ganze sehr einfach zu sein ( Quelle ). Auch mit Python sieht die Sache sehr leicht aus ( Quelle ). Da ich keine Ahnung habe was für campus.kit.edu verwendet wird, kann ich hier leider nicht mehr dazu sagen. Dann würde man noch eine Tabelle in der Datenbank benötigen. Die würde etwa so aussehen: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"openpgp_keys\" ( \"id\" int ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , \"student_id\" int ( 11 ) NOT NULL , \"public_pgp_key\" text NOT NULL , \"upload_date\" datetime NOT NULL , \"confirmation_date\" datetime DEFAULT NULL , \"is_activated\" tinyint ( 1 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' , PRIMARY KEY ( \"id\" ) ) AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 ; oder graphisch: openpgp_keys Tabelle Ressourcen Sollte jemand den Vorschlag modifizieren wollen, hier ist das HTML dazu: < div class = \"content_full_portal\" > < h1 > PGP/GPG </ h1 > < h2 > Neuen Schlüssel hinzufügen </ h2 > < div style = \"width: 100%;\" > < div class = \"gwf3_formY\" > < form action = \"/account\" method = \"post\" enctype = \"multipart/form-data\" > < table > < tbody > < tr >< td > Öffentlichen Schlüssel als Datei hochladen </ td >< td > </ td >< td >< input type = \"file\" name = \"gpg_file\" ></ td ></ tr > < tr >< td colspan = \"3\" > oder hier einfügen </ td ></ tr > < tr >< td colspan = \"3\" >< textarea id = \"gpg_paste\" name = \"gpg_paste\" cols = \"80\" rows = \"8\" ></ textarea ></ td ></ tr > < tr >< td ></ td >< td ></ td >< td >< input type = \"submit\" name = \"setup_gpg\" value = \"Schlüssel hochladen\" ></ td ></ tr > < tr >< td colspan = \"3\" >< input type = \"hidden\" name = \"gwf3_csrf\" value = \"gp1yqWh4\" ></ td ></ tr > </ tbody > </ table > </ form > </ div > </ div > < h2 > Liste bekannter Schlüssel </ h2 > < table style = \"width:100%\" > < tbody >< tr > < th > Name des Schlüssels </ th > < th > Datum des Uploads </ th > < th > Bestätigt </ th > < th > Aktiviert </ th > </ tr > < tr > < td > sdfasdf asdfasd asdf </ td > < td > 12.10.2013, 14:45 Uhr </ td > < td > am 12.10.2014, 16:00 Uhr </ td > < td > Ja ( < a href = \"\" > Deaktivieren </ a > ) </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > asdfasdf asdf asdfa sdf &nbsp; </ td > < td > 02.04.2014, 06:01 Uhr </ td > < td >< a href = \"\" > noch nicht </ a ></ td > < td > Nein ( < a href = \"\" > Aktivieren </ a > ) </ td > </ tr > </ tbody ></ table > </ div > und < div class = \"content_full_portal\" > < h1 > Prüfungsanmeldung </ h1 > Signieren Sie folgende Nachricht mit ihrem Schlüssel: < br > < a href = \"\" > Nachricht als Textdatei herunterladen </ a >< br > oder < br > Nachricht zum kopieren: < br > < textarea style = \"width: 800px;height: 60px;\" > Hiermit melde ich, Martin Thoma (Matrikelnummer: 1612345), mich heute (28.03.2014, 12:34:56 Uhr) zur Prüfung 'Programmierparadigmen', die am 10.04.2014 statt findet, an.

Dennoch sollte darauf hingewiesen werden, dass Weiteres nicht gerade optimal gelöst ist: Informationspolitik : Bereits zu Semesterbegin sollte folgendes bekannt sein: Zeitpunkt der Prüfung Letztmöglicher Zeitpunkt der Anmeldung Letztmöglicher Zeitpunkt der Abmeldung Die Anmeldungsfreischaltung der Prüfungen finden zu sehr unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten statt. Die Anmeldung sollte breits zu Semesterbegin für alle Klausuren möglich sein. Die Einsicht ist immer schlecht organisiert. Da sich die Prüfungstermine größtenteils in der vorlesungsfreien Zeit befinden und darin aber stark gestreut sind (manche sind zu Beginn, manche in der Mitte, manche am Ende) sind die Zeitpunkte, zu denen man als Student Ferien hat sehr stark eingeschränkt. Wenn man dann erst nach der Klausur erfährt, wann die Einsicht sein wird, kann man Ferien komplett vergessen, weil man in Karlsruhe bleiben muss um auf den Termin der Einsicht zu warten. Bei den Physikern ist wenigstens die Korrektur immer sehr schnell, sodass man davon ausgehen kann, dass die Einsicht wenige Tage nach der Prüfung statt findet. Bei den Informatikern ... naja, da hat man ja noch Glück wenn sie im selben Monat ist. Und man es dann rechtzeitig erfährt. Lösungen und Notengrenzen sind nicht in jeder einsicht vorhanden bzw. klar. Gerade wenn nicht klar ist, mit welcher Punktzahl man welche Note bekommt könnte ein Fehler passieren, den man nicht überprüfen kann. Nach diesen Informationen sollte man nicht in der Einsicht fragen müssen. Sie sollten in der Einsicht direkt verfügbar sein. Schlusswort Welche Vorteile hat das beschriebene Verfahren gegenüber der momentanen Situation? Studenten können beweisen, dass sie zur Prüfung angemeldet sind / nicht sind Prüfer können beweise, dass Studenten angemeldet sind / nicht sind Selbst wenn man den Teil mit der asymmetrischen Verschlüsselung nicht macht, hätte man als Student zumindest ein bisschen was in der Hand und einen Mechanismus, der automatisch Feedback gibt, ob alles geklappt hat. Im Gegensatz zu der momentanen Situation, wo wir absolut nichts belegen können und man sehr leicht übersehen kann, wenn etwas bei der Anmeldung schief gegangen ist. Was haltet ihr davon? Hattet ihr auch schon solche Probleme mit der Prüfungsanmeldung?","tags":"German posts","title":"Prüfungsverwaltung am KIT"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/prolog/","text":"Prolog is a logic programming language. Any prolog program consists of declaration of facts (also called objects) rules about objects and their relationship asking \"questions\" about objects and their relationship First steps At first you have to install swi-prolog . After installing it, you can call it with swipl . When you've started swipl you can import your myscript.pl files by consult(myscript). . Don't forget the point at the end. It is important and somehow like the ; in C. Defining facts The definition of facts can look like this: loves ( john , X ). Note that names of all relationships and all objects have to begin with a lower case letter. Variables begin with a capital letter. The relationship is written first ( john ). The objects are separated by , and everything is finished with . . The example from above means: john loves everything. You can have any number of arguments. The ordering of arguments is important ( loves(john,X) is not the same as loves(X,john) ). Symbols Boolean Prolog and , or ; if :- not not An underscore _ is an anonymous variable. Rules Rules consist of a head and a body. They are separated by :- . Questions ? own ( mary , book ) This will invoke the prolog unifier. So Prolog will check if the fact own(mary,book) can be derived from the known facts. Important is that it starts with ? . Everything else in questions is just like it was for facts. Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle This puzzle helped me a lot to understand how Prolog works. It goes as follows: Once upon a time a farmer went to market and purchased a fox, a goose, and a bag of beans. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But in crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases - the fox, the goose, or the bag of the beans. If left together, the fox would eat the goose, or the goose would eat the beans. The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it? Source: Wikpedia Let's call the side of the river where the farmer currently is 'left' and the other side 'right' to make things easier. When you solve this by hand, you should note the following: The only two things that the farmer can leave alone is the fox and the bag of beans. As the farmer is always in the boat when anything else is in the boat, you can ignore that step. Just think of the farmer and possibly one other thing teleporting from one side to the other. You only have to look at what's left and what's right. If nothing gets eaten on the left side and nothing gets eaten on the right side, you've got a valid situation. Whenever a situation occurs twice, you did some redundant steps. In other words: At least one solution exists, where no repetitions take place. The shortest solution is one of them. To solve this task, you split the problem into parts: Define a rule valid that takes a 4-tuple, where the first element is the position of the man, the second of the goose, then the fox and then the beans. Positions can either be left or right . Define a rule step(S1, Description, S2) that makes one step from situation S1 to situation S2 where Description contains the information what was brought to the other side. The situations are, as above, 4-tuples. Define a rule reachable(S1, SituationList, Steps, S2) that is true if S2 can be reached by any number of steps from S1 . The list of steps done to get from S1 to S2 is stored in Steps . The SituationList is used to prevent doing unnecessary redundant steps. So lets get through this. There are essentially three situations that can occur: The man is on the same side as the goose, the man is on the same side as the beans or the man is on the same side as the fox. If the man is on the same side as the goose, everything is fine. Nobody gets eaten / eats when the man is there. If the man is where the beans are, then the goose should not be where the fox is. The case that the goose is where the man is was done before. And the last case, the man is where the fox is. Now we have to make sure that the beans are not where the goose is: p ( left ). p ( right ). valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Goose . valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Beans , Goose \\= Fox . valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Fox , Goose \\= Beans . The step is also quite simple. There are four possible actions you could take at each situation: Only the man goes to the other side, the man and the beans / goose / fox go the the other side. So here is the code: step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox , Beans ), 'Man' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- Man1 \\= Man2 . step (( Man1 , Goose1 , Fox , Beans ), 'Goose' , ( Man2 , Goose2 , Fox , Beans )) :- Man1 \\= Man2 , Goose1 \\= Goose2 . step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox1 , Beans ), 'Fox' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox2 , Beans )) :- Man1 \\= Man2 , Fox1 \\= Fox2 . step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox , Beans1 ), 'Beans' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans2 )) :- Man1 \\= Man2 , Beans1 \\= Beans2 . And finally the reachable part. Either, you're already at the situation where you want to get to. So you don't have to do any step and it doesn't matter which situations you have seen so far. Or you want to get from S to G . That is only possible, when you can get from S to an intermediate situation with one step less: reachable ( S , _ , [], S ). reachable ( S , Visited , [ Step | Steps ], G ) :- step ( S , Step , Tmp ), valid ( Tmp ), not ( member ( Tmp , Visited )), reachable ( Tmp , [ Tmp | Visited ], Steps , G ). Putting it together: p ( left ). p ( right ). valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Goose . valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Beans , Goose \\= Fox . valid (( Man , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- p ( Man ), p ( Goose ), p ( Fox ), p ( Beans ), Man == Fox , Goose \\= Beans . step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox , Beans ), 'Man' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans )) :- valid (( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans )), Man1 \\= Man2 . step (( Man1 , Goose1 , Fox , Beans ), 'Goose' , ( Man2 , Goose2 , Fox , Beans )) :- valid (( Man2 , Goose2 , Fox , Beans )), Man1 \\= Man2 , Goose1 \\= Goose2 . step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox1 , Beans ), 'Fox' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox2 , Beans )) :- valid (( Man2 , Goose , Fox2 , Beans )), Man1 \\= Man2 , Fox1 \\= Fox2 . step (( Man1 , Goose , Fox , Beans1 ), 'Beans' , ( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans2 )) :- valid (( Man2 , Goose , Fox , Beans2 )), Man1 \\= Man2 , Beans1 \\= Beans2 . reachable ( S , _ ,[], S ). reachable ( S , Visited , [ Step | Steps ], G ) :- step ( S , Step , Tmp ), not ( member ( Tmp , Visited )), reachable ( Tmp , [ Tmp | Visited ], Steps , G ). start (( left , left , left , left )). goal (( right , right , right , right )). solve ( Steps ) :- start ( S ), goal ( G ), reachable ( S , [], Steps , G ). You can load this with swipl -s puzzle.pl and get all solutions with bagof(X, solve(T), L) . When you press ; after the first solution, you get the second solution. (Yes, this riddle has only two solutions that avoid redundant steps.) Material Introduction to PROLOG : One hour of introduction to prolog by Shashi Bhushan.

One argument for vim and against SSH could be that you can't simply use Sublime Text when you're accessing a computer via SSH. But there is a way! In the following, I will expain the simplest way how to remote edit files with Sublime Text. Preparation on your computer Install and start Sublime Text. Install the rsub package via Package Controll. Open ~/.ssh/config . Create it if id does not exist yet. Add the code from below. Start SSH with ssh myname . This is how the config file should look like: Host myname Hostname pc123.your.network.com RemoteForward 52698 127.0.0.1:52698 You can add more information like User yourusername to this file. Server-Side steps Download the rmate script: curl https://raw.github.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate > rmate Execute ./rmate yourfile . It will open in your local Sublime Text! Improvements These steps have to be done server-side. With Root access It's not so nice to open files with ~/rmate filename all the time. You can use rmate filename after executing this command: # This creates a symlink sudo ln -s ~/rmate /usr/local/bin/ You can use other paths than /usr/local/bin/ . Look at your PATH for candidates: echo $PATH Without Root access When you don't have root access, you can't create a symlink for most (eventually even all) folders in your PATH . But you can expand your PATH : mkdir -p ~/bin # create folder if it doesn't exist ln -s ~/rmate ~/bin/ # create symlink Now expand your PATH so that it includes ~/bin . There are at least two ways to do so: You can directly edit your shells .rc file (e. g. .bashrc , .zshrc , .cshrc , ...) or you can edit your .profile As many shells source .profile I'll explain this way. First, open ~/.profile . Then add # First check if that folder exists if [ -d \" $HOME /bin\" ] ; then # Add your home folder to the end of the current path PATH = \" $PATH : $HOME /bin\" fi","tags":"Code","title":"How to use Sublime Text via SSH"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/reviews/arena-villa-am-wasserpark/","text":"Ich hatte einen Termin in der Frankfurter US-Botschaft.

Take it as a quality guide. They are ordered by level of importance. The first thing is the most basic one that has to work, the last one is less necessary, but much cooler if you support it. In the following, I'll only talk about shells. But most of it will also apply to interpreters. Level 0: Robustness A shell has to be robust. Users rely on it when GUI doesn't work. This means it should definitely not fail. Never. And just to make sure that you get me correct. Commands get \"Entered\". So the user pushes \"enter\" when he wants something to happen. Everything the shell does meanwhile should not change the system (except for shell-related stuff) and not be able to slow down / crash the system. Level 1: Speed I expect a shell to start without recognizable delay. I'm not too sure how fast 'without recognizable delay' means. In the most extreme case it would be about 1/100 of a second, because when monitors have 100Hz they are said to be flicker free. You could not even see that. But I think it is not necessary. Another measure would be reaction time. I've just did an online test and saw that my reaction time is about 0.2 seconds. So a shell should be ready for user input after this time. Level 2: Left / Right arrow keys When I enter a command, it happens that I forget something. In this case I want to be able to navigate with left / right arrow keys through the console. Level 3: History with up / down arrow keys When you use the up-array, you should get the last command you've entered. When you press it twice, you get the second last command... So the shell should save your last commands in a so called \"history\". This history should be at least Level 4: Customization Promt History length Level 5: Path autocompletion The path should autocomplete when you hit Tab . The autocomplete should work as follows: The autocomplete should never get farer than one folder. If there are multiple possibilities to autocomplete, then it should only autocomplete what is in common. After a second Tab it should display the possibilities and after a third Tab the shell should go to the first possibility so that you can hit enter to use this possibility. Level 6: Command autocompletion The autocomplete function should also complete commands. Level 7: Fuzzy autocompletion When you make a typo in a path and hit Tab the shell should correct the typo if possible. Additional stuff Some stuff is nice to have, but not really essential: Some default commands like help , time , pwd , cd and echo . Ctrl + D as a shortcut for exiting. Ctrl + C should stop the current command. The configuration file should be stored in the home folder of the user and it should be called .[name]rc . The dot makes the file invisible by convention and 'rc' means 'resource configuration'. The prompt configuration should be easy. Some patterns that are used quite often are \\w for the working directory, where $HOME gets abbreviated with ~ \\u the username \\h the hostname Using colors for different parts Navigation with Pos 1 and End should work. Ranking Here is how some shells rank. Please note, that it's very difficult to check if a shell is robust. : Level 0 : Windows XP / Windows 7 default shell; Windows Power shell The shell is too slow. I don't know if this is still a problem in Windows 8, but I guess so. The scala interactive interpreter is slow. Level 1 : csh prints \"&#94;[[D\" when I press the left arrow and \"&#94;[[C\" when I press the right arrow. When I press Tab it only prints tab. What a crap. Level 3 : python seems to have possibilities to execute arbitrary python code at startup by specifying the environment variable PYTHONSTARTUP , but somehow this does not work on my system. However, customizing the prompt is fairly easy: import sys sys . ps1 = \"-->\" Level 4 : GHCi , a Haskell compiler, has mastered level 4. The prompt can be configured via ~/.ghci by adding :set prompt \"ghci> \" . If you want to show the current path, you can do it like this ( source ): let cur fill = do { cwd <- System . Directory . getCurrentDirectory ; return ( \":set prompt \\\" \" ++ cwd ++ fill ++ \" \\\" \" ); } : def doprompt ( \\ _ -> cur \">\" ) : def mycd ( \\ dir -> System . Directory . setCurrentDirectory dir >> cur \">\" ) : doprompt Level 4.5 : bash is robust, takes about 0.11 seconds to start, has a history of 500 lines as you can verify with echo $HISTSIZE , is customizable with .bashrc . tcsh takes about 0.02 seconds to start, has a default history size of 100 lines as you can verify with echo $history , is customizable with .tcshrc and .cshrc . Rubys interactive interpreter irb seems to be fast enough, has a history, the prompt can be configured in ~/.riplrc ( source ). I don't know if the history length is limited and can be adjusted. All shells in this level have path autocompletion as described in 5.1, but do not have autocompletion as described in 5.2. Level 7 : ZSH is the best shell I have ever used. Especially with oh-my-zsh .

It has a lot of features, is blazingly fast as I expect it from every editor and has a convenient configuration. It is available for Linux, Windows and Mac. You can use it for free without any restrictions as long as you want. But keep in mind that somebody had to develop this nice software. Installation You can get a free version from sublimetext.com or you could install it on Linux Mint via sudo apt-get install sublime-text I've added a symlink to make it easier to call it from command line: sudo ln -s /opt/sublime_text/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/sublime The editor is usable right after the installation, but you might want to make some fine-tuning. Package Control The Package Control plugin should definitely be installed. It makes installation of other packages so much easier. After you have installed it, you can press Ctrl + Shift + P to get this dialog: Sublime Tabs Configuration Sublime Text offers plenty of configuration options. You can apply them to projects, users or system wide. Most of the time, I change my preferences for me via Preferences > Settings - User: Preferences > Settings - User Here is what I have changed: { \"WrapPlus.break_on_hyphens\": false, \"color_scheme\": \"Packages/Colorsublime - Themes/textmate.tmTheme\", \"detect_indentation\": false, \"draw_white_space\": \"all\", \"fold_buttons\": true, \"font_face\": \"Ubuntu Mono\", \"font_size\": 15, \"highlight_line\": true, \"rulers\": [ 79, 120 ], \"scroll_speed\": 0, \"search_threshold\": 1000000, \"tab_size\": 4, \"translate_tabs_to_spaces\": true, \"use_tab_stops\": false } Note that you have to install the color scheme and the font ( source ) to use it. Command Palette You can get to the command palette by Ctrl + Shift + P . This opens such a dialog: automatical alignment This will do a fuzzy search through all elements in the menu. So you don't need to use Alt + arrow keys no longer. I love it ☺ Plugins LaTeXTools The LaTeXTools package adds support for LaTeX. It adds shortcuts, a pull-down menu when you enter \\cref{ and much more. BracketHighlighter BracketHighlighter adds brackets on the left side. It looks like this: Highlight braces Alignment Sublime Alignment gives you the possibility to mark text, press Ctrl + Alt + a to align: automatical alignment Colorsublime Colorsublime is a plugin for theming Sublime Text&nbps;3 within seconds. Take a look at colorsublime.com for some examples. TrailingSpaces Tools for easy removing trailing spaces with Ctrl + Shift + T . See GitHub repository . Wrap Plus Tools for easy wrapping lines with Alt + Q . See GitHub repository . Python Flake8 Lint Highlight potential problems with Python code. See GitHub repository . Themes First of all, make sure you have installed the Colorsublime package. After you have it, you can press Ctrl + Shift + P and enter \"Install Theme\". Then it contacts the server and provides you a list of many good themes. You can go through them with the arrow keys and they will instantly be applied! I really like the \"Textmate\" theme, but the \"Chrome_DevTools\" theme is also good. Custom Keybindings You can create custom keybindings via Preferences Key Bindings (User) I have these: [ { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+r\"], \"command\": \"reindent\", \"args\": { \"single_line\": false } }, { \"keys\": [\"shift+tab\"], \"command\": \"unindent\", \"args\": {\"single_line\":true} }, { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+7\"], \"command\": \"toggle_comment\", \"args\": { \"block\": false } }, { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+7\"], \"command\": \"toggle_comment\", \"args\": { \"block\": true } }, { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+t\"], \"command\": \"delete_trailing_spaces\" } ] Custom snippets Snippets are a very cool feature of ST . They allow you to enter some text, press Tab and get whatever you wanted. So you could create a new .tex document, enter article , press Tab and get a template for a LaTeX document of the article document class. A tutorial how to create a snippet for the article document class was written Jonathan Page: Creating Snippets in Sublime Text 2 for LaTeX Buildin Keybindings Ctrl + p : Goto file Ctrl + Shift + P : Goto anything Ctrl + r : Goto section Ctrl+R in Sublime Text (LaTeX) Ctrl+R in Sublime Text (Markdown) Ctrl + Shift + Up / Down : Move the current line one line up / down Shift + F11 : Distraction free mode Distraction free mode Ctrl + D : Multi-Select What could be better Chrome-like Tabs Look at this: Sublime Tabs Now compare it to this: Chrome Tabs Chrome tabs look much cleaner, don't they? Many others seem to think that, too ( source ). Line Wrapping Sublime Text 3 does wrap points and commas to the next line: line wrapping This behaviour is bad and not liked by the community ( source ). Support for Tooltips It would be absolutely great for many plugins like linters if they could make use of tooltips. Any news on tooltip and sidebar API?

As I use my notebook quite often and as this is the third notebook within three years that is not usable any longer (the screen of the first is defect and the graphic card / WLAN of the second does not work propperly with the new Linux kernel), I'm would like to have a high end notebook this time. I hope that I not have to think about notebooks for at least 5 years after that. Requirements I work quite a lot with the computer, so the keyboard and the display have to be good. What does good mean? Well, the display has to be at least 15\" and as I don't want to see my pixels any longer it has to have a higher resolution than 1366×768 . But it has to be smaller than 30cm × 38cm to fit into my knapsack. A reason why I do not always have my current notebook with me is that it is too heavy with about 2.5kg and does only run for about 3.5h. The new one should be lighter than 2.5kg and run at least 4h . Ubuntu has to be supported completely, especially WLAN, sound and Bluetooth. Speaking of Bluetooth, I want Bluetooth 4.0 , because it introduced a low energy protocol that might be usefull for notebooks. As I live in a city and as I access the internet via my neighbors WLAN (thank you!), I need a good connection: Dual band and 802.11a/b/g/n need to be supported by the notebook. (Dual band is sometimes also called 2x2). I use it mainly for writing blog articles, LaTeX stuff and some Python programming and watching movies. I download movies via Online TV Recorder which sums up quite soon. Transfering this to my external HDD always takes a lot of time. The new notebook should support USB 3.0 to speed this up. As I don't have to store anything large, 80 GB SSD is enough. It should be a SSD, because they consume less power, are more durable and are more silent. I need at least 4GB RAM because ... well, did you ever try to use Eclipse for Java+JBoss programming with less than 4GB? I don't want to have that again. It would be nice if I could use the notebook outside in the summer which means it has to have a bright matte display . I want a silent notebook, because I'm very sensitive to noise. My current notebook has less than 30 dB in normal mode (no heavy load). That should set the mark. A SD-Card Reader would be nice, but it is not required. Just like a RJ-45 for network cables and a DVD drive you can get it via USB. I robust case is also important. I had troubles working in the train, because the screen was whipping as hell. But this is not a hard requirement for me as I don't work in trains that often. Current Favorites I've looked at a lot of notebooks and I did mainly focus on the technical specification and not at the price (I guess I might work about 10h every day in front of this machine. A good, working notebook is very important to me). However, when I see some notebooks that are ok according to the specs from above, I will take the cheaper one. By the way, while searching for notebooks I discovered that much of the data on Amazon is wrong. See for example the dimensions of the HP EliteBook 8570p-B6Q03EA-ABD (51.6 x 34.2 x 7.8 cm according to Amazon).

Asus Zenbook seems also to work almost out of the box.[&#94;6] I've just learned that you can use sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name to determine your exact laptop product name.

This page should include at least: Weight in kg and dimensions in mm Battery life in mAh Display (size, glare or matte display, supported resolutions) Exact CPU name (not only Intel i5 - if it varies, list all possible CPUs) Disk (size, SSD or not) Wireless support (IEEE 802.11 supported standards? Dual band? Bluetooth? Bluetooth version?) Keyboard: Does it have a numblock? Backlit? Does it have a DVD-Player / Burner? Blue-Ray? Webcam (resolution) Microphone Sensors (GPS) Image of the notebook A good specification page would include: Noise in dB Information about Linux support (especially Debian) Explain your version names!

It helps you to make use of a cluster by giving you a command line interface to add jobs to a queue. That means, you and other users can specify program calls that get executed as soon als all conditions are met. I currently need to work with this, because I have some pretty heavy tasks that occur periodically, but don't need to be executed immediately. More concrete, I am working in the field of ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition. In ASR you have models that include probabilities for ... well, let's don't get into detail for that. The important part is that those models need to be trained. And they can get adapted to speakers. As soon as you have more recordings, you can try to improve the model. And this training involves a lot of computation and data processing. As the training job is executed periodically, but not always when a new recording is present, you might also have recordings for many different speakers. So you can improve many models when this script is started. So this can be done on different computers in parallel. SLURM basic usage A simple call could look like this: srun python test.py -aflag -param value Other notable commands are: squeue : Gives a list of all running / pending jobs sbatch : Run a batch script in background scancel : Stop a job Important parameters for srun are: --mem=[X in MB] --job-name=[Name of your SLURM job] --dependency : Start this job when all dependencies are met. This could be time or other jobs Another important command is squeue . It allows you to list all jobs in command line (if you have a GUI: sview ). You can get your jobs only with squeue -u mthoma , where mthoma should be replaced by your user name.

At the moment, I can't really say if I like Ruby. Just like PHP and Python, Ruby is implicitly typed. This means you can do the following: # A list a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] # An integer b = 42 # A floating point number c = 3 . 141 Ruby is also dynamically typed: a = 42 a = \"now a is a string!\" One thing that is pretty annoying is the usage of begin ... end . I thought LaTeX was the only \"language\" in use that had this syntax. Syntax examples If, else if, else a = 1 if a == 1 || a % 2 == 0 puts \"a equals 1 or is even\" elsif a == 3 puts \"a equals 3\" else puts \"a does not equal 1 or 3 and is not even\" end String manipulation String manipulation is weird in Ruby. Take a look at the last example. What would you expect? s = \"0123456789\" puts s [ 2 .. 4 ] puts s [ 2 .. s . length () ] puts s [ 2 ..- 2 ] Output is: 234 23456789 2345678 Now what would you expect to happen with \"0123456789\"[2..4] ? I would expect Ruby to give \"234\" . But this one actually fails. Dictionaries Dictionaries, which are sometimes also called 'maps' or 'associative arrays' are a neat data structure. Ruby uses this syntax: dictionary = { \"a\" => 7 , \"b\" => \"x\" } if dictionary . has_key? ( \"a\" ) puts \"key 'a' is in dictionary! It is \" + dictionary [ \"a\" ]. to_s dictionary [ \"a\" ] = 42 puts \"Now it is \" + dictionary [ \"a\" ]. to_s puts dictionary . size () puts dictionary . length () puts dictionary . count () end map myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] x = myList . map { | element | [ element , element + 1 ] } x . each do | a , b | puts \"a: \" + a . to_s + \", b: \" + b . to_s end will print a: 1 , b: 2 a: 2 , b: 3 a: 3 , b: 4 a: 4 , b: 5 a: 5 , b: 6 .count(), .length(), .size() At a first glance, those three seem to be aliases. But .count() is not quite the same as .length() and .size() ( source ). Blocks A very interesting idea in Ruby is that of blocks. It seems to be similar to Pythons decorators: def time_method ( method = nil , * args ) beginning_time = Time . now if block_given? yield else self . send ( method , args ) end end_time = Time . now puts \"Time elapsed #{ ( end_time - beginning_time ) * 1000 } milliseconds\" end time_method do ( 1 .. 10000 ) . each { | i | i } end Logging Logging in Ruby is very convenient.

The reason is that I've migrated my WordPress Blog to Jekyll. This means it takes some source files and generates purely static pages from that. The generation process is independant of user requests. Jekyll is a static blog generator, just like Pelican , Hyde , nanoc and Octopress . I've spend about 40-80 hours to migrate from WordPress to Jekyll. And I'm not done jet. Jekyll compared with WordPress Jekyll is a static site generator. This means you have the source files on your computer. Then you generate the website with Jekyll and upload only the generated files. So you only push content to the server, but you don't have to download anything from the server. Reasons for Jekyll: Security : With Jekyll, you only upload static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, ...). There is nothing where the user can pass some data. This also means there is one thing less to update. Assuming your provider updates your server software (e.g. Apache) you don't have to update anything. In contrast, when you don't regularly install updates on your WordPress blog (and hope that those updates don't break anything), your blog is quite likely to be hacked. Speed : The webserver needs only to serve the sites. Nothing else. Of course, when you use caching with PHP you might get into a similar situation with WordPress. But it will never be faster. Hosting : You only need webspace. This reduces hosting cost significantly. Additionally, you can use Amazon S3 for hosting! Backups : Creating security backups is VERY easy with Jekyll. Every tool that can make bakups of files can backup your Jekyll blog. No need to worry about databases. If a file is corrupt, only that file is affected. No worries about maximum execution time for importing / exporting backups. No need to get SSH access. Simple FTP access does the job. Reasons for WordPress: Comments : There is no way to get comments only with static pages. So you need something else, e.g. disqus . Search : Could probably be done with JavaScript, but I guess it is difficult. Editor : WordPress gives you a WYSIWYG editor. I don't know if there is something similar for Jekyll. Compile time : Compilation time is very long for Jekyll. For my blog, it needs over 6 minutes. As I test the result quite often before I publish posts, this is very annoying. Tagging, Category pages, Author pages : Currently, Jekyll lacks basic support for blogging. You don't have tag pages per default, the plugins that provide tags don't have paginated tag index pages. The same problem occurs when it comes to categories or authors. Timed posts : I did not use timed posts very often, but it is very easy to create them with WordPress. With Jekyll, on the other hand, you have to know how to create cronjobs. And your computer has to be running. Install Jekyll On an Ubunty system I need for this blog: $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev imagemagick ruby-rmagick libmagickwand-dev ruby-execjs ruby-nokogiri $ sudo gem install jekyll $ sudo gem install dimensions $ sudo gem install fileutils $ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/blog GitHub Create your repository Go to github.com , sign in and create a new repo: Call it [Username].github.io . Branches The way to use Jekyll with GitHub is by using branches. Go to your Git repository that cointains your blog: moose@pc08 ~/Downloads/MartinThoma.github.io $ ls _config.yml favicon.ico index.html Makefile Readme.md css images js _plugins _site _drafts _includes _layouts _posts thumbs Now you should create a new branch that will contain your source files. The following command creates a branch sources that starts where the branch master currently is: git checkout -b source master Now update this branch to the server: git push -u origin source When you enter git checkout . master you will switch to the master brach. The same way you can switch to the source branch. After you've entered the command, you can look at the folder in your file system. There will only be the data of the current branch. Custom Domain If you want to host your content at GitHub, but have a custom Domain like martin-thoma.com instead of martinthoma.github.io , you have to: Ask your provider (in my case \"Knallhart\") to add an A-record to Github. Add a file called CNAME with content martin-thoma.com (yes, without http:// ) to the root of your directory GitHub also offers some help on setting up a custom domain with Pages . FTP Server If you have your own FTP server, you probably want to use it. One tool that might now come to your mind is rsync . But rsync needs SSH ( source ). If you have SSH, then you can do something like this: rsync -avz --delete _site/ user@host:/path/to/web/root The --delete options \"delete[s] extraneous files from dest dirs\", -a means archive which preserves the owner, group, change date and some more of files, -v is verbose as always and -z is for compression while the file transfer happens. --progress might also be interesting, especially for the first upload. Otherwise, you might want to try curlftpfs . This program lets you mount a FTP folder: curlftpfs ftp.example.com/backups /mnt/ftpserver and you can also umount it: rsync --delete /var/backups /mnt/ftpserver Markdown I've switched between rdiscount and redcarpet . The former is faster, the latter supports fenced code blocks. I finally stuck with redcarped, because Liquid has problems when it comes to C++ for loops after curly braces. Other Markdown parsers are maruku (which has a Multiple lines for HTML <li>-tag issue) and kramdown (which is slow and does not handle fenced code blocks and LaTeX correctly). Similar to Matthias I would like to share a feature matrix of Markdown parsers included into Jekyll. I have used jekyll 1.4.3 to create the following table. I've used this page to see if fenced code blocks and pygments is working and that page for LaTeX. Everything was tested with this site . redcarpet rdiscount kramdown maruku LaTeX ✓ ✓ ✓ ? Fenced code blocks ✓ ✓ ~ ? Pygments ✓ ✓ ✓ ? Site generation 176.90s 165.41s 293.26s ? Kramdown destroyed some fenced code blocks (but not all) and maruku did not even compile my site at all. Linebreaks and newline Linebreaks are an issue. Sometimes I want to get a <br/> , sometimes I make linebreaks to make reading of the text files easier. It's basically this discussion . Currently, I'm not satisfied with the situation. I never had that problem with WordPress. WordPress simply created paragraphs just at the right location. Customization You can create custom Liquid filters , plugins and templates. Everything is quite easy. The Liquid templating language seems to be very similar to Django Templates (Python). Make the Website super-fast CSS Minification sudo gem install juicer juicer install jslint juicer install yui_compressor Images I've included small images as base64 (used this online tool ). According to caniuse it's quite save to use. Site Search Site search is a real problem. I've seen three solutions so far: Dynamic Search : You can add a dynamic part to your statically generated website. For example, I create a search/index.php and a SQLite database like it was described here . Static JavaScript : Create a JSON file or something similar and search dynamically with JavaScript in it. External Search Engines : You could use a search engine for searching your site, of course. Hosted by you: Commercial * Google Custom Search * Index Den : Has no direct support to parse your website PHP+SQLite JavaScript solutions One JavaScript solution I've found is lunr . This one is really bad as it copies the whole body to a json file. This json file has to be loaded before it works. But my posts total at the moment to 2MB. I'm pretty sure my readers don't want to wait until 2MB are downloaded. So this one does only work for smaller websites. Christan Fei's solution does only search in the title and category. Templates Jekyll uses Liquid as a templating language. It is similar to Django templates. Here is a short introduction to Liquid. A Sublime Text template is the following: <snippet> <content><![CDATA[ --- layout: post title: ${1:} author: Martin Thoma date: 2014-11-22 17:19 categories: - ${2:Cyberculture} tags: - ${3:Rating} featured_image: logos/${4:star.png} --- ${5:} ]]></content> <!-- Optional: Set a tabTrigger to define how to trigger the snippet --> <tabTrigger>---</tabTrigger> <!-- Optional: Set a scope to limit where the snippet will trigger --> <!-- <scope>source.python</scope> --> </snippet> Some tests Validation validator.w3.org : My site is HTML-valid.

This is called a \\(n\\) -glon. Basics about polygones A \\(n\\) -glon can be defined by a list of \\(n\\) points. Note that the order is important: [A, B, C, D, E, F, G] != [A, B, C, D, F, E, G] I will not consider self-intersecting polygones for the following statements. I'm aware of them, but whenever you have a self-intersecting polygon you can create multiple polygones that cover the same area and don't intersect each other (some pairs might have a finite number of points in common, but not an infinite number). Is a point in a triangle / a rectangle It is quite easy to check weather a point is inside of a triangle or inside of a rectangle. I have already written an article about how to check if a point is inside of a rectangle . Is a point inside of a n-glon? Let \\(P\\) be a point and \\(N = [P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_n]\\) be a \\(n\\) -glon. It is now much more difficult to check if \\(P\\) is inside of \\(N\\) . The area-approach works for convex \\(n\\) -glons, but that's it. Count Crossing Line Segments However, you can try another approach which I have visualized in the following image: Check if P is inside of N When \\(P\\) is inside of \\(N\\) , every line \\(P_{1}P, P_{2}P, \\dots, P_{n}P\\) will cross the polygon lines \\(P_{1}P_2,P_{2}P_3, \\dots, P_{n}P_1\\) an even number of times. If P is outside, at least one of the lines \\(P_{i}P\\) will cross a polygon line \\(P_{j}P_{j+1}\\) once. This means, for every check you have to check \\(n&#94;2\\) pairs of line segments for crossings. How you can do that is explained in my article How to check if two line segments intersect . This algorithm is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) time complexity (it does need a constant amount of additional space). Triangularization When you have a lot of querys, you might want to divide your polygon into convex polygones. The easiest way to do this might be dividing \\(N\\) into triangles. That way, you can check for every triangle if \\(P\\) is inside of it. I assume that the number of triangles is not bigger than \\(n\\) . As the check is in constant time for one triangle, you would have an algorithm that needs \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) time and space for its checks (+ some preprocessing which is done only once).","tags":"Code","title":"How to check if a point is inside of a polygon?"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/word-error-rate-calculation/","text":"The Word Error Rate (short: WER) is a way to measure performance of an ASR . It compares a reference to an hypothesis and is defined like this: $$\\mathit{WER} = \\frac{S+D+I}{N}$$ where S is the number of substitutions, D is the number of deletions, I is the number of insertions and N is the number of words in the reference Examples REF: What a bright day HYP: What a day In this case, a deletion happened. \"Bright\" was deleted by the ASR. REF: What a day HYP: What a bright day In this case, an insertion happened. \"Bright\" was inserted by the ASR. REF: What a bright day HYP: What a light day In this case, an substitution happened. \"Bright\" was substituted by \"light\" by the ASR. Range of values As only addition and division with non-negative numbers happen, WER cannot get negativ. It is 0 exactly when the hypothesis is the same as the reference. WER can get arbitrary large, because the ASR can insert an arbitrary amount of words. Calculation Interestingly, the WER is just the Levenshtein distance for words. I've understood it after I saw this on the German Wikipedia: \\begin{align} m &= |r|\\\\ n &= |h|\\\\ \\end{align} \\begin{align} D_{0, 0} &= 0\\\\ D_{i, 0} &= i, 1 \\leq i \\leq m\\\\ D_{0, j} &= j, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\end{align} $$ \\text{For } 1 \\leq i\\leq m, 1\\leq j \\leq n\\\\ D_{i, j} = \\min \\begin{cases} D_{i - 1, j - 1}&+ 0 \\ {\\rm if}\\ u_i = v_j\\\\ D_{i - 1, j - 1}&+ 1 \\ {\\rm(Replacement)} \\\\ D_{i, j - 1}&+ 1 \\ {\\rm(Insertion)} \\\\ D_{i - 1, j}&+ 1 \\ {\\rm(Deletion)} \\end{cases} $$ But I have written a piece of pseudocode to make it even easier to code this algorithm: WER calculation Python #!/usr/bin/env python def wer ( r , h ): \"\"\" Calculation of WER with Levenshtein distance.

The error will be the same as it was for r[:i-1] and h[:j-1] If its a substitution, you have the same number of errors as you had before when comparing the r[:i-1] and h[:j-1] If it was an insertion, then the hypothesis will be longer than the reference. So you can delete one from the hypothesis and compare the rest. As this is the other way around for deletion, you don't have to worry when you have to delete something.","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Word Error Rate Calculation"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/formatting-strings-python/","text":"In Python, you can use the following ways to format Strings: Print directly Printing them directly (just like printf in C ): birthday = 28 month = \"April\" year = 1990 print ( \"My birthday is the %i -th %s %i .\" % ( birthday , month , year )) The first string contains the rules how to format. %i means that the first argument in the following tuple should be interpreted as a integer. The second one %s should be interpreted as a string and the third one again as a integer. Save as string >>> a = \"Why is %i the answer?\" % 42 >>> a 'Why is 42 the answer?' Named formatting You might prefer named formatting: >>> \"{guy} loves {girl}.\" . format ( girl = \"Marie\" , guy = \"Martin\" ) 'Martin loves Marie.' You can also store this first in a dictionary an unpack it: >>> myDictionary = { \"girl\" : \"Marie\" , \"guy\" : \"Martin\" , \"other\" : \"Internet\" } >>> \"{guy} loves {girl}.\" . format ( girl = \"Marie\" , guy = \"Martin\" ) 'Martin loves Marie.' Date and Time You can format time any way you like, just look at this reference . Lists Question: I would like to print a list! How do I do that? Answer: Convert your list to a string >>> myList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> print ( \"Your list: %s \" % ( str ( myList ))) Your list : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] str and repr When you build your own objects, you should add an implementation for the method str and repr . The first one should return a string representation that is human readable of the object, the second one should return a string that identifies the object.

Here is a table of the number of function calls n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 calls 1 1 3 5 9 15 25 41 67 109 177 21891 To be exact, the number of calls of the fib-function is: $$ f(n) := \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } n \\leq 1\\\\ f(n-1) + f(n-2) + 1 &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$ This means the dumb function is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(2&#94;n)\\) ! (I'm not quite sure, but this I think this is not only time complexity, but also space complexity. I think it is not tail recursive , so the complete stackframe has to be saved.) Memorization with decorators One way to solve the problem much faster (in fact in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) time and space complexity) by storing values we already calculated. A very neat way to achieve this are decorators. It might be a common problem that you have a recursive, mathematical function with no side effects. So you can write a wrapper that checks if the value has already been calculated. If not, the function proceeds as usual. It it has already been calculated, you can simply look it up: def memoize ( obj ): cache = {} def memoizer ( * args , ** kwargs ): if args not in cache : cache [ args ] = obj ( * args , ** kwargs ) return cache [ args ] return memoizer @memoize def fib ( n ): if n < 2 : return n else : return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) Notice that I've only added @memoize over the function definiton of fib ! I love Python ☺ By the way, this formula has also some limitations. Python has a fixed maximum recursion depth. So fib(332) worked fine, but fib(333) gave: RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison You can get around this limitation by successive calls of fib: # Call to fill array fib ( 332 ) # The number of recursive steps is now much smaller: print ( fib ( 500 )) That gave 139423224561697880139724382870407283950070256587697307264108962948325571622863290691557658876222521294125. A pretty big number. Formula of Moivre-Binet The formula of Moivre-Binet gives a closed form for calculating fibonacci numbers: \\(\\varphi = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}\\) \\(\\psi = 1 - \\varphi\\) \\(f(n) = \\frac{\\varphi&#94;n - \\psi&#94;n}{\\phi - \\psi}\\) Although this is mathematically exact, it will not work on computers due to a fixed floating point precision. Lets check how long it works: #!/usr/bin/env python import functools def memoize ( obj ): cache = {} @functools.wraps ( obj ) def memoizer ( * args , ** kwargs ): if args not in cache : cache [ args ] = obj ( * args , ** kwargs ) return cache [ args ] return memoizer @memoize def fib ( n ): if n < 2 : return n else : return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) def moivreBinet ( n ): phi = ( 5 ** 0.5 + 1 ) / 2 psi = 1 - phi return int (( phi ** n - psi ** n ) / ( phi - psi )) from itertools import count for i in count ( 0 ): exact = fib ( i ) constTime = moivreBinet ( i ) if exact != constTime : print (( \"The %i -th fibonacci number is %i . Moivre-Binet \" + \"gives due to precicion error %i (delta= %i ).\" ) % ( i , exact , constTime , abs ( exact - constTime ))) break So the answer is: The 72-th fibonacci number is 498454011879264. Moivre-Binet gives due to precicion error 498454011879265 (delta=1). This is a reason to prefer the \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) solution over the \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) solution. If you're only exact for 72 numbers, you could also simply store them. Looking number up form an array is always faster than any calculation. Very high numbers The following solution is fast and works 0.075 seconds for the 20000 Fibonacci number (which has 4180 digits). def fib ( n ): def accFib ( n , Nm2 = 0 , Nm1 = 1 ): for i in range ( n ): Nm2 , Nm1 = Nm1 , Nm1 + Nm2 return Nm2 return accFib ( n ) Additional ressources The article on literate programs is worth reading. They show some very different programs that calculate Fibonacci numbers.","tags":"Code","title":"Fibonacci, recursion and decorators"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/programmierparadigmen-klausur/","text":"Dieser Artikel beschäftigt sich mit der Vorlesung „Programmierparadigmen\" am KIT.

I think this is just the right time to explain the words Shell, command line, Terminal, Bash and ZSH. Terminal is an terminal emulator, sometimes also called a \"terminal window\". I work in a window environment (MATE) and I want to use command line tools within that environment. So I need a \"terminal window\": Terminal Window with ZSH and Bash ZSH and Bash are both Unix shells. A shell is a command line interpreter that provides a text-based user interface. Command line describes the textual way you interact with the computer. When you're in a graphical user interface situation you interact by manipulating windows with your keyboard/mouse. When you're in a text-based user interface situation, you interact by entering commands in a line (hence command line). Solarized Dark Theme The Solarized Dark Theme is very good for command line. It can be installed like this as explained here : $ git clone https://github.com/oz123/solarized-mate-terminal.git $ cd solarized-mate-terminal $ ./solarized-mate.sh dark restart the terminal. Oh-my-ZSH Installation Oh-my-ZSH is a plugin for ZSH. I think this plugin is very good and makes a big difference to Bash. So when you look at the screenshots below, keep in mind that this is not a \"plain vanilla\" zsh. Install \" Oh-my-ZSH \" Install \" powerline fonts \" and change your Terminal font to one of them Change your Terminal theme to \"agnoster\" by setting ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\" in ~/.zshrc Set your terminal theme to \"Solarized Dark\" ( description ) Make ZSH your default Shell in MATE Terminal ( description ) and eventually sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh username ZSH and Bash Here are some differences. On the left side is zsh, on the right is bash: Bash vs zsh: cd command completion Bash vs zsh: Git prompt indicator Bash vs zsh: Spelling correction Bash vs zsh: time command I like the time command of bash more, but that's it. All other interactions are either almost the same or better in zsh. I especially like that zsh doesn't print everything again when you autocomplete with tab. And it also autocompletes when you make an capitalization error. I also begin to like the Git-specific prompt indicators: ZSH 'git add' indicator Some usefull tools ack You might already know grep . And if you've worked with it, you might already have typed something like the following: grep --exclude-dir = \".svn\" \"searchterm\" * grep -rI \"onlytextSearchterm\" . An alternative to grep is ack (for Ubuntu users: ack-grep ). See beyondgrep.com . Windows It seems to be possible to get something similar (the same?) for Windows.

Part I was about simple matrix multiplication algorithms and Part II was about the Strassen algorithm. Part III is about parallel matrix multiplication. We got some pretty interesting results for matrix multiplication so far. Now, I would like to get to know in how far performance increases (or decreases) if I make use of multiple cores. I only have two cores, so I hope somebody with a better computer will also run the ikj single core algorithm form part I and the parallel version from this article and post the results as a comment. The implementations As last time, I've added the scripts to a GIT repository . So you can test it on your machine. Before we start implementing code for multiple processors, we have to get an algorithm that is actually parallelisable. You could use Cannon's algorithm , a algorithm that makes use of systolic arrays or try to find a solution by your own. The Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm (short: SUMMA) could also work. The paper that I've linked is well-written and easy to understand. You should definitively read it, if you're interested in matrix multiplication. I will not use any advanced algorithm in this article. I will make the outer most for loop of the ikj-algorithm (see part I) execute in parallel. More about parallel matrix multiplication: Case Study: Matrix Multiplication berrendorf Algorithms for efficient matrix multiplication Coppersmith-Winograd algorith Python Because of global interpreter lock (GIL), you need to start new processes in Python ( source ).

Part I was about simple implementations and libraries: Performance of Matrix multiplication in Python, Java and C++ , Part II was about multiplication with the Strassen algorithm and Part III will be about parallel matrix multiplication (I didn't write it yet). You can always multiply a matrix \\(J \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times m}\\) with its transpose \\(J&#94;T\\) , because \\(J&#94;T \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{m \\times n}\\) . You will get a matrix \\(C \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) . Standard matrix multiplication of square matrices \\(\\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) is in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;3)\\) . With the Strassen algorithm you can multiply in \\(\\approx \\cal O(n&#94;{2.807})\\) . But this is for general matrix multiplication. When we do \\(J \\cdot J&#94;T\\) we have more structure, so it might be possible to do this multiplication faster. One important property of the result matrix \\(R = J \\cdot J&#94;T\\) is symmetry. So \\(R_{i,j} = R_{j,i}\\) . If we used the ikj-algorithm for this multiplication, we needed \\(n&#94;2 \\cdot m\\) operations. This way, we only need \\(\\frac{n&#94;2 +n}{2} \\cdot m\\) operations. Yes, I know, asymptotically it is irrelevant. But skipping almost half of the operations is still quite good.

I would really love to do them, but they seem to be a little bit too time consuming to do them in my free time. Please send me an E-Mail if you would like to realize them! Book portal I really miss a book recommendation portal. It should allow you to mark books you've read or started to read, let you rate and tag books. The tags should be created by users, similar to the system StackExchange uses. Tags might be funny\", \"zombie\", \"magic\", \"romance\", \"love\", ... and users should rate for tags for books. In some general settings you define language(s) you know. Every book, which should be administrated by ISBN number if possible, should have information about the language. The portal should also see when books are only released with a new cover / collectors edition and notice that its the same story. With this information, it should recommend books and allow you to search books. Eventually you could connect to friends and let their ratings influence what you get. And, very important, it should let you follow series and/or authors. So you should be able to say \"When there is a new book of the 'Harry Potter' series, send me an e-mail!\" or \"When there is a new book of the 'Harry Potter' series translated to 'German', send me an e-mail!\". Science and Education Platform Sometimes, scientists get new insights that are able to influence millions. But until such a great invention or discovery is made, hundreds or thousands of people might have thought about the same problem. Today, with MOOCs education in some fields is quite open to a lot of people. Khan academy offers many very basic courses, Coursea and Udacity a few advanced ones. But the process of creating new content seems to be quite closed. Wikiversity is more open, but very limited. For example, I think it is not possible to include my graphic filter examples . And it is not possible to track progress of students. I think it is necessary to gamify this. Both, students and educators, should get rewards. They might be only digital, but a student who can see the progress he makes might be much more interested in continuing a course. A teacher who can see the influence he has, who can see how students learn and where problems are might be much better able to improve his content and be motivated to do so. Also, scientists should not have to worry about presenting their studies. A lot of people know how to create graphics, some people know better about (the English) language and others are experts in LaTeX. If people were able to create requests online, get rewards for helping others and provide rewards to show that they really need help, I guess much better research could be made. Of course, this should be open. For every unit / paper, there should be definitions what is necessary to know. The topics should automatically be linked to content that provides the knowledge. It is very complex to plan such a system, because education in different languages / nations might be very different and ideas how to educate vary a lot. Even subtasks (creating a LaTeX editor, a graph that shows influence of papers / books by citation, creating an image editor, creating a reward system) are very difficult. And everything has to scale for millions of users. This means you would have to plan quite a lot before you could even think about implementation. For this project, you would need: Somebody, who has experience with online courses. A teacher for children. A teacher for teenagers. A teacher for students. Somebody, who has experience with gamification. Somebody, who has contacts to politics and knows how to advertise. Advertisement Site I actually want advertisement. But I want also to easily keep track of it. I don't want to look at stuff just to see that the advertisment was old. And I don't want advertisment when I have lots to do and no time to buy things anyway. So giving people the possibility to go to a website and look at advertisment the way they want might be very interesting. Site for Documents Who wants to read all of the legal stuff we have to sign all the times? I would really like to have a website where standard contracts are. Some people read them and highlight the important stuff / the implications. A bit like tldrlegal.com , but not only for licenses. Wikipedia AI Try to categorize images in Category:Uncategorized images or find images that have the wrong category / missing categories. Translations I did some translation work some years ago for LordsAWar . From a software point of view, this was a pain in the ass. Rosetta (part of Launchpad, for Ubuntu) is much better. Another idea that is much better is Duolingo . getlocalization.com might also be worth a try. Wiki-like Dictionary Wikipedia is great, but the Wiktionaries suck. I would like to have a dictionary service. It should be working for all language combinations (English ↔ German; English ↔ French; German ↔ French; ...). The data should initially be filled by computers, but then be improved / corrected by humans. Database It is basically a database with a nice interface. The database should have the following tables: Languages: LangID, Name in the language itself, icon Literature: LiteratureID, LangID, ISBN Words: WordID, Word, Normalized Occurences in Standard Literature WordPronounciation: WordPronounciationID, Pronounciation in phonetics, Pronounciation by a human Pronounciation by a human should be stored on Wikipedia Commons WordTags: WordTagID, Tag, Description in Markdown Examples: Adjective, Substantive, male, genitiv, past, medicine ...

There might be more than one correct translation for a word (e.g. \"Bank\") Note that some translations might be more appropriate, depending on the context. Users: UserID, DisplayName, E-mail, HashedPassword Initial Data Wiktionaries For nouns: Lemmas of articles Features Downloadable minimal dataset for language combinations (e.g. on your smartphone in case you don't have internet access). The most important words (2000 or so) should come with the audio data. Web search like dict.leo.org (e.g. example search ) Forum to ask for translations, given context. Discussion pages for entries Moderators to \"protect\" entries. Ranking to find most important words which need some human work Distributed, Universal Tagging System Tagging Most information can be displayed rather simple. A string that describes the kind of information and a bool / int / float / string / BLOB for the information itself and an identifier. For example, you can describe a product with the following labels: Identifier: \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\" \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"ISBN-10\": \"0141439513\" (string) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"ISBN-13\": \"978-0141439518\" (string) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"Pages\": 480 (int) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"Publisher\": \"Penguin Classics\" (string) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"Category\": \"Book\" (string) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"Category\": \"Literature\" (string) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"Category\": ed054753e4b240a8aa1322ad348bf728 (identifier) \"898a4c822ffc456fa7a417e500b2c05a\", \"VIEW\": 0839c5beac414fb19c400b6ca0372388 (identifier) Identifier: \"ed054753e4b240a8aa1322ad348bf728\" \"ed054753e4b240a8aa1322ad348bf728\", \"Name\": \"Literature\" \"ed054753e4b240a8aa1322ad348bf728\", \"Category\": \"Books\" As you can see, it is possible to create nested categories with this structure. You an also create lists this way. Now clients should store information like this and share it. Views When information is presented like this, it is quite useless. But what about this kind of presentation: Pride and prejudice infobox (defined here ) Or, for example ark.intel.com : Intel Arc compare processors So another required feature of such a client are \"views\". A view is defined by an identifier (so that you can tag views just like any other object) and an HTML template. Objects could have labels called \"VIEW\" with type identifier that tell the client which view should be added. Distribution There are plenty of cool tools out there (Amazon recommendations, ark.intel.com to compare Intel processors, blackberry allows you to compare their phones, Wikipedia info boxes, ...). But most of them are very ristricted. For example, the way I compare smartphones is not fundamentally different from the way I compare processors. Yes, the attributes differ. But basically it is creating a table with all the information. Also, Intel does not provide information about AMD processors. So we need a way to get and share information. XML is the way-to-go for centralized computer systems. Maybe they can also be used to realize what I'm thinking about. But I think a problem that has to be solved is that we don't have a single source for all information that we trust in. We have networks of trust. When Intel says A and a friend says B about an Intel processor, I guess I will rather believe A. But when Intel does not provide some information about a processor and a friend says B, but a person I don't know says C, I'll believe B. But when thousands of people say C and my friend says B, I might rather believe C. It's getting complicated, right? Maybe the processor example is not good, as there is much information and information is either right or wrong. But lets say we talk about genre of movies. This might be much more difficult as there is no \"definitely right\" or \"definitely wrong\". Multiple answers might be right. So every information has also have to carry information about who thinks it is right. And you have to be able to define networks you trust in. Perhaps you could create \"people objects\" that can also be labeled. \"Your\" object had to be protected so that only you could add \"friend of\" labels or \"I trust\" labels or something like this. Python Code Search Do you know Debian Code Search ? Michael Stapelberg, the creator of it, described how he did it in his bachelor's thesis . I would like to have the same for Python code. This could be done by downloading all Python packages. I already did this part, see Analyzing PyPI Metadata and the follow-up post which is still on my TODO-list to be published (see draft ). It would also be possible to add GitHub repositories. Comment.it Sometimes, I just want to add my 2ct to something. I would like to have a central website / service - preferable as a browser plugin - with which I can add comments to other websites on an URL basis (including anchors for maximum exactness). Then I could read what other people think of something, even if there is no comments section. The comment should contain a very specific link. For some websites - like wikipedia - a permalink can be created. Others might change the content after a comment was made. For this reason a screenshot should be taken. Deep links help to make a comment to exactly what you mean. Help the user to use deep links. Identifiers besides URLs: Books have ISBN numbers. There are ISSN numbers. Other products have bar codes. People have lots of identifiers (names, ORCiD, e-mail). However, the possibility to add comments to a person should be examined carefully. They might not like it. They might not get useful comments / to much \"shitstorm\". They might also use legal means to prevent comments. To make comments more useful, gamification can be used: People have \"karma\". It represents the value they've added to the community. They start with 0 karma. At X karma, they get the \"trusted user\" rights. Everybody can add comments by default Moderators might restrict this to \"trusted users\" Only trusted users can add URLs within the comment. Upvotes for good comments Upvotes give karma to the creator of the comment You are only allowed to upvote when you are a trusted user Downvotes for bad comments Downvotes remove karma from the creator of the comment The downvoter gets also karma removed (to prevent bashing people) Users with more than 10 comments with less than -5 rating get soft deleted. Moderators can delete users if they are purely spam It is a \"soft delete\" Users can veto soft deletes. In this case they have to speak with a moderator, after they passed some Captchas. For reviews there are microformats which should be used. Charity Search & Find \"Vermittlung\" ( recruiting? ) of people who have the ability needed for charity organizations. People: profile / abilities Text, grade / level? tags? location Karma? Filtering Projects: Profile page for each project photos members / oranization / roles / karma / contributers domain Other elements: Forum: phpBB? Disqus? File uploads: Imgur? Calendar E-Mail list: GNU Mailman? Surveys: Limemonkey? Online CV A service to create an online CV. Manage your CV only in one place instead of many (LinkedIn, StackExchange, ORCiD, ResearchGate, ...). Sadly, many nice URLs are already gone: cv.me, its.me, about.me note.me, write.me, ping.me, help.me lookat.me Things to link: arXiv profile page http://dblp.uni-trier.de/ - http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/t/Thoma_0001:Martin Job Portal for cheap jobs It seems to me that LinkedIn is mainly for high-paid jobs. However, \"cheap\" jobs like cleaning people or handymen are also looking for jobs Social Network like Facebook (Groups, pages, sharing, upvoting), but with Markdown.

One could also make it a web service (dbadmin.io or something similar). Chrome I had some ideas how to improve Chrome . MATE After the changes in desktop environments, MATE got my favorite desktop environment. Although I was more happy with GNOME 2.6. Adding the drag-and-drop effect that creates a new window from an tab, known from Chrome, to Terminal and Pluma (gEdit). Creating a LaTeX plugin for Pluma that auto-completes the environments. LaTeX Tools I would like to create online tools (pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that make the following tasks simpler. A table editor. I know Trubens table tool , but this tool does not allow to combine cells. Also, the site is down quite often. A Ti k Z editor. An editor for bibliography. A LaTeX source code beautifier. A LaTeX-aware spell checker. This spell checker could probably use aspell, but it would have to filter LaTeX code. Also, I would like to create an app that helps users to create formulas. This app should run on smartphones and on tablets. I don't think that this can be done with pure JavaScript. Jabber Messaging App There are some commercial messangers which are wide-spread (WhatsApp, Facebook Messanger, Skype), some known secure messangers (Threema, Signal) and lots of other messangers (see Comparison of instant messaging clients , 2 ). However, there seems not to be a single client which has the following: Security Free Software Encryption of text messages Support of Android and iOS as well as a web interface Support of open protocolls (XMPP - see Comparison of instant messaging protocols ) Support of sharing pictures Support of sharing short audio messages Efficient voice calls Efficient video calls Text messaging features Emoticons UTF-8 Typing indicator Status: Message on server / Message on target client / Message read Open Hardware I'm fascinated by the idea of open hardware. That means that you publish plans of something and maybe also how to create it. Although I don't have any experience in this field, I can think of some interesting projects. One way to support open hardware would be to create an education and science platform, like the one I've described above. Open Internet I guess most smartphone users know this situation: You go to a friend / on vacation and you don't have WLAN. This means you have to use mobile internet, which is expensive. If you're in an area where not many people live, it is ok. If you're in a big city, it is not. There are so many people who have an internet connection and a router which already establishes a WLAN. You can see them, but not use the connection! What a shame! What we would need is a device with the following attributes: Simplicity It has to be a DSL modem and a router combined, eventually also a DSL filter . Everything has to be configurable via web interface. This interface has to be VERY GOOD. You should be able to get a backup file via web interface that contains every single configuration. This file should be an good documented XML file. The documentation should contain example data. Every setting should have its own url, just like in Google Chrome. As many self-tests that give meaningful messages as possible: A LED that indicates if the device has power. Ethernet jack should glow if a device is connected and blink if data is send. A software test via web interface that checks if internet connection is available. Direct feedback when you enter wrong / malformed credentials. A reset button that restores the software completely from non-erasable memory. Small memory and rechargeable battery that allows you to download router software updates when the battery is full. A user manual with pictures that explains what to do to get internet. Functionality and requirements It has to be able to create a WLAN. It has to be fast. I think currently 802.11n is with 450 Mbit/s the best you can get for WLAN and 1000 Mbit/s for Ethernet At least one Ethernet jack. It should be secure (WPA2, eventually don't support WEP and WPA). Reasonable energy consumption and no active fans. A standardized power supply unit that can be bought without buying a new device. Box - how it looks The case should be robust. You should be able to mount it to a wall or to lay it on the floor. I don't think it is necessary to support VoIP, ISDN and Surf Sticks. Now the special part: It should allow you to create a WLAN that others can use by registering in a service. The device should guarantee that you get the bandwidth, in case you need it. But if you have free bandwidth, others should be able to use it. Of course, this function should also protect you from legal trouble. An essential problem is keeping you from legal trouble while making sure that nobody uses the system to betray external users. But when you solve this problem, I guess it would be quite easy to establish free WLAN in all bigger cities. A great chance for tourism and a backup-option for you when your internet connection breaks. The service should also allow the user to register the free WLAN online. An app should download these locations and be able to navigate a user to the next free WLAN. Ah and of course everything in there should be free. This piece of hardware is critical for your internet access. If you want to be sure that you don't get under surveillance by an attack on this piece of hardware, it would be good to know that some smart people had the possibility to check if everything is fine with this hardware. Work computers Today, we have a lot of computers that are used for very, very simple work. The most computing intensive part might be large Excel sheets. So basically, they don't need any improvements in hardware for years. But the few things they do, need to be done well. Security is important. It is also important that things are stable and don't change a lot. And what they do should be fast. Loading times are almost not acceptable. I guess many tasks could be done within a browser. So work that needs heavy computation can be done on a stronger machine (the cloud - not necessarily outside of the company). Why hasn't any big company like General Motors , General Electric , Wallmart or even countries that have thousands of schools and government employees tried to create such a computer that is really reliable, robust and cheap (energy and because it can be produced it can be produced in very big numbers)? Here is what I think should be ok: processor with low power consumption (700 MHz or more) 2 GB of RAM (I guess you might now think of this missatributed Bill Gates quote ... but with cat /proc/meminfo you can see how much you currently use). 30 GB SSD: Important information should be stored on a computer that is protected very well against data loss. A SSD is silent and can read content very fast. Ideally, only the OS is stored on the employees computer. VERY silent fan, if possible non at all. Big monitor with high resolution, because those people have to work all day with the computer and low quality speakers. Good and silent keyboards (like the CODE keyboard ). Network card. Graphic card that allows the high resolution display. This is just a quick thought. I think such a system should contain some reference software that has to run fluidly. The software should also be open, of course. I think the following should be enough: Linux based OS (e.g. Debian ) Basic command line tools (bash, grep, find, cat, vim) Desktop manager with classic desktop metaphor (e.g. MATE ) File manager with access to a network drive (e.g. Caja or Nautilus) Modern Browser (Firefox or Chrome) Tasks that can (and should) be done via browser are: E-mails: e.g. Roundcube Excel: Hmmm ... I know that Google Docs offers some similar stuff. Bug I guess it can't replace Microsoft Excel by now. I don't know if there are any self-hosted services Word: e.g. Etherpad Outlook: e.g. OwnCloud LaTeX: e.g. FlyLaTeX Geographic information systems: I don't know if there is software online. But I guess with OpenStreetMaps it should not be too difficult to create it. ArcGis seems to be one solution. Basically, you can do almost everything with a web application. So the client can get quite slim. But although you could probably do everything with a self hosted client/server solution, those solutions don't always exist yet. Tasks that should not be done via browser might be: Professional video/audio editing: I guess you need more than one monitor to display all relevant information. Programming: Although I have seen Cloud9 , I doubt that programming in the cloud can be convenient in the next years. How does bug fixing work? How about manual testing? Whats with parallel execution? Messaging: If you want to use encrypted communication (e.g. E-mail with PGP) you should probably do the encryption on your machine. Hmmm ... astonishingly, I can currently not think of more tasks. Not so smart phone Do you remember the good old days when your cell phone wasn't essentially a small PC? I've bought a smartphone a while ago ( article ), but I still see reasons to have a cell phone: Battery life: My Motorola W156 had a battery with only 940 mAh, but 465 hours stand-by time. If it had 3100 mAh as the Samsung Galaxy Note II , it would have a standby time of 1534 hours! That are about 64 days! Security: Have you ever heard of somebody hacking a device that can only phone and send SMS? Cost: The Motorola W156 costs 25 Euro on Amazon. Robustness: A friend of mine put her Nokia 3310 accidentally in the washing machine. After that, she removed the battery, let it dry for a week, put the battery back. It worked. What the hell!?! (See also: Nokia is forever and Indestructible Nokia 3310 meme ) Size: Modern smartphones are a little bit uncomfortable to phone with. They are too big, although they are very thin. A size of 114 x 43 x 14 mm is fine, maybe a little bigger is also ok. The needed functionality is: Phone with good quality Send SMS (and repetedly try to do so if no net is available) Store about 100 contacts Save about 100 SMS Load battery via micro USB ( Common External Power Supply ) If not too complicated: Let me back up all data on the phone via this micro-USB slot and let me also restore such a backup 3.5mm phone jack for using a headset What is not needed: Camera, Flashlight Internet access, Bluethooth, NFC, ... Multi-colored display: B/W screen is just ok Fingerprint scanner Light Alarm Clock An alarm clock which wakes you up with light. Features: Set multiple alarms (Non-lit) display which shows the time time to the next alarm in X d - Y h - Z m format Batteries Be able to set multiple alarms: Choose days for which the alarm rings Choose dimming profile for the alarm (smooth - aprubt) Be able to change the (dimming) light which is inside Machine Learning Face recognition package I am not aware of any Python face recognition package, although I think face recognition is a very well-studied problem. There are a couple of web services (e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 ), but sometimes you don't want to send a company your photos. Or your application just needs to process too many pictures. There is also this repository , but even if you only put a hand in front of your eyes or tilt your head, it stops recognizing your head. So the aim of this project would be to build a Python package which allows recognition of faces in images, gives a good representation of those faces and allows to tell if two faces are the same or different (face verification). The api could be something like: import faces face_list = faces . get_face_locations ( 'some_photo.jpg' ) if len ( face_list ) >= 2 : if faces . is_same_person ( face_list [ 0 ][ 'representation' ], face_list [ 1 ][ 'representation' ]): print (( \"The person found at %s and the person found \" \"at %s are the same\" ) % ( face_list [ 0 ][ 'location' ], face_list [ 1 ][ 'location' ])) faces . save_overlay ( input = 'some_photo.jpg' , output = 'some_photo-overlay.jpg' , face_list ) Jarvis Basically a smart room Hardware: In the corners of the room: Microphones Cameras Speakers Lights Connected by WLAN Display (Beamer?)

Bitcoins can be transferred through a computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution. The concept was introduced in a 2008 paper by a pseudonymous developer known only as \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", who called it a peer-to-peer, electronic cash system . The processing of Bitcoin transactions is secured by servers called bitcoin miners. These servers communicate over an internet-based network and confirm transactions by adding them to a ledger which is updated and archived periodically using peer-to-peer filesharing technology. In addition to archiving transactions, each new ledger update creates some newly minted bitcoins. The number of new bitcoins created in each update is halved every 4 years until the year 2140 when this number will round down to zero. At that time no more bitcoins will be added into circulation and the total number of bitcoins will have reached a maximum of 21 million bitcoins . To accommodate this limit, each bitcoin is subdivided down to eight decimal places; forming 100 million smaller units called satoshis. In August 2013 Germany's Finance Ministry subsumed Bitcoins under the term \"unit of account\"—a financial instrument—though not as e-money or a functional currency. Although bitcoin is promoted as a digital currency, many commentators have criticized bitcoin's volatile exchange rate, relatively inflexible supply, high risk of loss, and minimal use in trade. Source: Wikipedia Sounds interesting, doesn't it? I'd like to share my thoughts about some aspects of Bitcoin. Please note that I'm neither an economics student, nor did I read the specifications of Bitcoin. Security of Bitcoin Data loss Once in a while, hard discs crash. If you're unlucky, you will lose all your data. This could mean you lose your Bitcoin wallet, so you lose your money. There is absolutely no way to get the money back. It's lost. Just like if you've lost bank notes in a big city. You will never get it back ( source ). BUT, unlike with bank notes, nobody else will get it. These Bitcoins are lost and nobody can do anything against that. I think that means after 2140 the number of active Bitcons will drop ! This is called a deflation with normal money. But as you can subdivide every bitcoin in as small pieces as you like, I'm not sure what this means for economy. Attacks When money is involved, there will always be people who try to profit from that. So you have to think about security of Bitcoins. System attacks For me, a system attack is an attack where somebody tries to break the system. He does NOT want to profit from the system, but he wants to harm all people who use it. The only attack I've found is a 51%-attack ( source ). This means, in long term you have to have more than 50% of the computing power of the total bitcoin network. So if there is a dramatic change in computing power, this might make Bitcoin as a system insecure. Also, in short term with much luck you might also take down the network with less computing power ( source ). But the more people participate, the more unlikely it gets. And this problem might our current system also have. If somebody manages to get MUCH more computing power, he could break encryption. This means, all bank transactions could at least be read by this attacker, if not manipulated. Theft Theft is possible by stealing your credentials. This can be done by infecting your computer with a virus, just like it can be done today with your bank account if you use online banking (or with the computers of banks, though that should be much more difficult). Also, the software you use for Bitcoin transactions might have errors. Money laundering It seems to be a big problem of Bitcoin that money laundering might be easy. You can't close a criminals account, you cannot stop criminals using Bitcoin for illegal operations. But what can you do with the current currency against that? Not much, when the money gets abroad. Credits You can't give credits as banks do it today with Bitcoin. If I understand it correctly, the \"Common Equity Capital Ratio\" has to be at least 3.5% in 2013 ( source ). In other words: banks are allowed to give more than 27x the amount of money they actually have! Now I'm very uncertain if I'm here correct, but I think this was an important reason why the financial crisis happened. This would not have been possible with Bitcoin! With Bitcoin, you can only give credit for money you currently have. No cent ... uhmm ... Sotisho more than that. BUT: I really don't know if this would be better. I guess it would be extremely difficult for states to get money. There would be the need of heavy restructuring in how we finance our countries. Interest A problem with credits in the Bitcoin-system would be that it is very difficult to estimate what the result of the interest would be. As there are \"only\" 21 million Bitcoins, it would bet possible that the sum of all dept is more than available Bitcoins. Can it be legal to force people to pay when you know that at least one technically can't pay at the end? This problem seems not to exist in the current system, as they always print new money. Wages At the moment, employed people have to fight in unions for more money. They really need it, because inflation happens all the time. So just to keep the current situation, employees have to do something. With Bitcoin, the situation might change. As we produce more and more every year, a deflation would be likely. This means, bosses would have to cut loans to keep the situation the same. But it is much more difficult to change the bills you pay. People will not blindly accept less money on their accounts per month. Unlike today, when people are basically ok when they get a compensation for inflation.

So the Viterbi path is xyzz. Please note that there might be multiple paths with the highest possibility. As every state depends only on the state before, you can get the most likely path step by step. In every step, you calculate how likely it is that you end up in state x, state y, state z. After that, it doesn't matter how you got there. So you always have to expand those three nodes. You will get 9 following states, but only three of them matter (for each resulting state, the paths that had the highest probability leading there).

A quaterion \\(h\\) can be written as a vector or in the form of \\(h = h_0 + ih_1 + j h_2 + kh_3\\) , where \\(i, j\\) and \\(k\\) are related to the \\(i\\) in complex numbers. Accordingly \\(h_0\\) is often called real part and h_1, h_2, h_3 are called imaginary part of a quaternion. For \\(i, j\\) and \\(k\\) the following rules are applied: \\(i&#94;2 = j&#94;2 = k&#94;2 = -1\\) and \\(ijk=-1\\) Basic rules From these rules follows: \\begin{align} ij &= k\\\\ ji &= -k\\\\ jk &= i\\\\ kj &= -i\\\\ ki &= j\\\\ ik &= -j \\end{align} ( proof ) Multiplication Now, obviously quaternions multiplication is not commutative: \\(ij = k \\neq -k = ji\\) But for numbers in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) , it is commutative ( proof ). The multiplication is: \\begin{align} x y &=( x_0 y_0 - x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2 - x_3 y_3)\\\\ &+( x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0 + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2) \\mathrm i\\\\ &+( x_0 y_2 - x_1 y_3 + x_2 y_0 + x_3 y_1) \\mathrm j\\\\ &+( x_0 y_3 + x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 + x_3 y_0) \\mathrm k \\end{align} Calculating multiplicative inverse This means, when you're given an element \\(x = x_0 + x_1 \\mathrm i + x_2 \\mathrm j + x_3 \\mathrm k\\) its inverse \\(y\\) can be calculated by solving the following linear system of equations: \\begin{align} x_0 y_0 - x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2 - x_3 y_3 &= 1\\\\ x_0 y_1 + x_1 y_0 + x_2 y_3 - x_3 y_2 &= 0\\\\ x_0 y_2 - x_1 y_3 + x_2 y_0 + x_3 y_1 &= 0\\\\ x_0 y_3 + x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1 + x_3 y_0 &= 0\\\\ \\end{align} which can be written as: $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc|c} x_0 & -x_1 & -x_2 & -x_3 & 1\\\\ x_1 & x_0 & -x_3 & x_2 & 0\\\\ x_2 & x_3 & x_0 & -x_1 & 0\\\\ x_3 & -x_2 & x_1 & x_0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right).$$ According to mathworks it is \\(y = \\frac{x_0 - \\mathrm i x_1 - \\mathrm j x_2 - \\mathrm k x_3}{x_0&#94;2 + x_1&#94;2 + x_2&#94;2 + x_3&#94;2}\\) More Conjugate Just like the complex conjugate is defined as \\(\\overline{z} = a - ib\\) with \\(z=a+ib\\) the conjugate of quaternions is defined as \\(\\bar x := x_0-x_1\\mathrm i-x_2\\mathrm j-x_3\\mathrm k\\) with \\(x=x_0+x_1\\mathrm i+x_2\\mathrm j+x_3\\mathrm k\\) Rotating points Quaternions can be used to rotate points.

For example, if you had the point (2,0,0) and you wanted to rotated it by \\(q = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0)\\) you would transform (2,0,0) to (2i+0k+0j) and calculate \\begin{align} x' &= q x \\overline{q}\\\\ &= (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\mathrm j) \\cdot 2 \\mathrm i \\cdot (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\mathrm j)\\\\ &= (\\sqrt{2} \\mathrm i + \\sqrt{2} \\mathrm{ji}) \\cdot (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\mathrm j)\\\\ &= (\\sqrt{2} \\mathrm i - \\sqrt{2} \\mathrm k) \\cdot (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\mathrm j)\\\\ &= \\mathrm i - \\mathrm{ij} - \\mathrm k + \\mathrm{kj}\\\\ &= \\mathrm{i - k -k - i}\\\\ &= -2 \\mathrm k\\\\ &\\Rightarrow x' = (0,0,-2) \\end{align} Rotation matrix to quaternion Let \\(M\\) be a rotation matrix and \\(m_{ij}\\) be an entry of this matrix.

Was kann ich über Karlsruhe erzählen? Wieviel Praxis bekommt man in einem Informatik-Studium am KIT? Leider denke ich nicht, das ich wirklich gut darüber schreiben dann, da ich nur „Informatik I\" an der Uni Augsburg gehört habe. Sonst war ich nur am KIT. Auch über Karlsruhe kann ich nicht so viel erzählen, wie man sich vielleicht denkt. Ich bin meistens am studieren. Daher habe ich von Karlsruhe außerhalb der Innenstadt bisher wenig gesehen. Ein paar Anhaltspunkte könnte die Wikipediaseite des KIT sowie die einstieg-informatik.de-Seite geben. Genug allgemeines bla-bla. Nun lasse ich die Disclaimer-Sätze (meinem Eindruck nach, ich kenne eigentlich nur das KIT und habe keine aussagekräftigen Vergleiche, ...) weg und erzähle etwas über Karlsruhe und das KIT. Das Studium Allgemeines Die Regelstudienzeit des Bachelor-Informatik-Studium beträgt 6 Semester und 180 ECTS . Davon sind 15 ECTS für die Bachelor-Arbeit, 6 ECTS für Softskills (z.B. Sprachkurse und verpflichtent 2 ECTS für Teamarbeit in der Softwareentwicklung) und folgende Plicht-Kurse vorgesehen: Lehrveranstaltung ECTS Weitere Links 1.

Semester Datenbanksysteme 4 Rechnernetze 4 Numerik 4.5 5. Semester Algorithmen II 6 Programmierparadigmen 6 6. Semester Bachelorarbeit 15 $\\sum$ 124 Ich habe „ Analysis I+II \" anstelle von „Höhere Mathematik I+II\" und „ Lineare Algebra und analytische Geometrie I+II \" anstelle von „Lineare Algebra I+II\" gehört. Das sind die Mathematiker-Kurse. Wie ihr nun erkannt haben werdet, bleiben \\(180 - 124 - 6 = 50\\) übrig. Da ich die Mathematiker-Kurse gemacht habe (die jeweils 9 ECTS anstelle von 5 und 4 geben), bei mir sogar nur 41 ECTS. Davon muss man zwei Stammmodule für jeweils 6 ECTS machen. Dann sind es nur noch \\(50-2 \\cdot 6 = 38\\) ECTS. Die Praxis der Softwareentwicklung (PSE) ist übrigens eine tolle Sache am KIT-Informatik-Studium. Dort sucht man sich aus einer vorgegebenen Auswahl an Projekten eines aus. Dieses bearbeitet man in einer Gruppe von 5 Studenten für ein halbes Jahr. Ich habe an einem Projekt des Frauenhofer Instituts gearbeitet, das sich UpToDatE (Upload automation and data entry) nannte. Mal schauen, vielleicht schreibe ich mal etwas darüber. Stammmodule Computergraphik Echtzeitsysteme Formale Systeme Kognitive Systeme Rechnerstrukturen Sicherheit Softwaretechnik II Telematik Proseminare Die Informatik-Proseminare sind leider sehr schlecht organisiert. Ich habe auf GitHub ein öffentliches Repository, wo ihr hoffentlich aktuelle Informationen über Info-Proseminare finden (bzw. auch eintragen) könnt. Softstkills Von den 6 ECTS für Softskills sind ja schon 2 verpflichtend in Teamarbeit für die Softwareentwicklung (TSE - gehört zu PSE). Das ist nur ein Kniff mit dem Modulhandbuch, weil man wohl kein Stammmodul mit 8 ECTS machen konnte / wollte, also hat man PSE mit 6 ECTS und 2 ECTS für TSE. Praktisch bedeutet PSE auch so viel Arbeit, dass 8 ECTS angebracht sind (eher sogar mehr) und man muss im Team arbeiten. Man bekommt die Punkte also nicht geschenkt, aber man muss auch nichts außerhalb von PSE dafür machen. Von den 4 übrigen Punkten kann man sich aus vielen interessanten Kursen des HOC etwas aussuchen, z.B. Kurse des Sprachenzentrums . Diese sind deutlich besser als die Sprachkurse in der Schule. Ich habe mich für English C1: Advanced entschieden. Da ich aber auch ein Tutorium gehalten habe (was 4 ECTS und 8,67 Euro/Stunde gibt), hätte ich das nicht machen müssen. Der Kurs war aber so toll, dass ich es nicht bereue. Weitere Kurse Ich habe folgendes belegt: Web-Engineering 4 Algorithmen für planare Graphen 5 SEHR viele weitere Kurse sind im Modulhandbuch zu finden. Hier ist übrigens mal ein Abhängigkeitsgraph zum KIT-Bachelor-Informatik: Abhängigkeiten im Bachelor-Informatik Studium am KIT Es ist am KIT als Informatiker übrigens sehr leicht eine HiWi-Stelle zu finden. Ergänzungsfächer Man kann am KIT aus einer Fülle von Nebenfächern Ergänzungsfächern wählen: Elektro- und Informtionstechnik Maschinenbau Mathematik Physik Grundlagen des Rechts Volkswirtschaftslehre Betriebswirtschaftslehre Operation Research Auf Anfrage kann man aber wohl noch weitere machen. So studiert ein Bekannter in Richtung Medizinische Bildgebungsverfahren einiges. Mathematik Proseminar 3 Mein Vortrag zum Proseminar Diskrete Mathematik Einführung in die Algebra und Zahlentheorie 9 Topologie und Geometrie 9 Man kann noch Analysis III und Funktionalanalysis / Hilberträume machen und vermutlich geht noch viel mehr, wenn man nachfragt. Sonstiges Das KIT hat eine 24h-Bibliothek (ja, die ist wirklich 24h offen, auch Sonntags. Meines Wissens macht die nur an Weihnachten zu), die ATIS (tolle Lernräume, viele Computer, Drucker, ein Scanner), ein Rechenzentrum . Der Campus ist zusammenhängend. Das, was als „Campus Nord\" bezeichnet wird ist ein Forschungsbereich. Dort werden keine Vorlesungen gehalten. Für Bachelor-Studenten ist der Campus Nord also irrelevant, außer ihr wollt da einen Job. Tipps zum Studium Ganz unbescheiden: Mein Blog ist toll ☺ Nein, im ernst, wenn du etwas vom Mathe-Stoff nicht verstehst, kann ich dir nur empfehlen mal rein zu schauen und vielleicht die Tags „ linear algebra \" oder „ analysis \" zu durchstöbern. Ich blogge zu relativ vielen Themen, mal auf Deutsch und manchmal auf Englisch, die meistens für einen KIT-Informatik-Studenten von Interesse sind. Eventuell ist auch meine kleine Linkliste interessant. Mathe ist interessant , aber wohl nicht jedermanns Sache. Ich denke ein guter Informatiker sollte auch gute Mathe-Kenntnisse haben. Noch kann ich nicht beurteilen, ob sich für mich das Besuchen der Mathe-Kurse (+Klausuren) gelohnt hat. Es war auf jeden Fall deutlich schwerer. Aber ich bin davon überzeugt, dass es sich lohnen wird. Bleib am Ball : Gerade in Mathe - egal ob Analysis oder HM - muss man immer versuchen am Ball zu bleiben. Vorbereitung (das Kapitel im Skript lesen) und Nachbereitung (am Abend kurz aufschreiben: Was wurde gemacht? Und dann kontrollieren: Kann ich das auch?) lohnen sich. Bzw., ich habe das im 2. Semester nicht gemacht und es hat sich bei der Klausurvorbereitung gerächt. Die ersten Vorlesungen sind besonders wichtig. In fast allen gibt es ein gutes Skript, das auch online ist. Fast überall wird genau das Skript gemacht, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Aber manchmal werden Dinge im Skript eher betont oder vielleicht etwas genauer erklärt/ein Beispiel mehr gemacht. Also: Skript direkt am Anfang ausdrucken und immer mitnehmen. Drucken : Bis auf die Skripte würde ich alles in der ATIS (und nicht im SCC) drucken. Du solltest nach der O-Phase beide Accounts haben. Übungsblätter : Es lohnt sich, die Übungsblätter ordentlich zu machen. Sie sind, neben Altklausuren, die beste Klausurvorbereitung. Also: Mache deine Lösungen kleinschrittig, eventuell mit Erklärungen die du in einem Semester nutzen kannst, schreibe sie sauber auf und mach alle. Egal wie schwer sie sind oder wie wenig Zeit du hast. Das wird - im 2. Semester - anstrengend, aber es lohnt sich. Also nicht nur auf die Punkte schauen, die du für den Übungsschein brauchst, sondern auch an die bevorstehende Klausur denken. FAQ Frage : Ich kann nich programmieren. Ist das schlimm? Antwort : Nein! Am KIT lernt man alles von Grund auf. In „Programmieren\" lernt man Java, in „Betriebssysteme\" grundlegendes C, in „PSE\" - je nach dem was man macht - C++, Java, C#, in „SWT I\" grundlagen über paralleles Programmieren mit Java. Frage : Wie Praxisnah ist das Studium? Antwort : Kommt darauf an, was man später machen will und was man als Vergleich nimmt. Vermutlich sind die Fachhochschulen näher an der Praxis, wenn man auf reines Programmieren hinaus will. Aber wenn ihr einfach nur im Beruf programmieren wollt, müsst ihr nicht studieren. Vielleicht macht dann eine Ausbildung mehr Sinn. Frage : Was lernt man in der Informatik, wenn nicht Programmieren? Antwort : Vieles. Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen, wie genau ein Rechner von einzelnen Transistoren, über Schaltungen, Schaltwerke, Maschinencode und Assembler funktioniert, was theoretische Berechnungsmodelle sind, was überhaupt berechenbar ist, wie Computer lernen können, wie man mit Ungenauigkeit in Berechnungen umgeht, wie man Programme/Probleme sinnvoll strukturiert, was Sicherheit in der Informatik ist und wie man verschiedene Sicherheitsbegriffe zeigen kann... Frage : Was ist charakteristisch für die Informatik am KIT? Antwort : Das KIT hat eine große Informatik-Fakultät. Wenn man hier Informatik zu studieren beginnt, kann man sich in alle (oder zumindest viele) Richtungen weiterentwickeln. Außerdem ist das Informatik-Studium am KIT sehr Mathematik-lastig. Frage : Ich würde gerne XYZ lernen, aber das steht nicht im Modulhandbuch. Kann ich das trotzdem am KIT lernen? Antwort : Es gibt einen E-Mail-Verteiler für Studenten. Dort kann man einfach mal fragen, ob andere auch interesse daran haben. Außerdem gibt es Hochschulgruppen . Bei über 3000 Studenten wird sich schon jemand finden, der auch XYZ machen will / es kann. Karlsruhe Am KIT werden immer wieder interessante Vorträge gehalten, z.B. Google Tech Talk: JavaScript and V8 - A functional-ish language and implementation in the mainstream TalKIT Weitere Es gibt den Science Slam Karlsruhe , Physik am Samstag und sehr viele weitere Veranstaltungen . Falls man mehr über Karlsruhe wissen will: Auch dazu gibt es einen Wikipedia-Artikel . Wohnungen Tja, eine Wohnung zu finden ist in Karlsruhe schwer. Mit der Wohnungssuche sollte man sehr früh beginnen. Es gibt zwar einige Wohnheime , aber auch die sind voll. Und die Qualität der Wohnheime ist sehr unterschiedlich. Ich habe gehört, dass das HaDiKo und die Insterburg nicht so toll sind, aber das an der Waldhornstraße soll sehr gut sein. Es gibt neben den Wohnheimen in dieser Liste noch mindestens eine weiteres (das evangelische Studentinnen-Wohnheim in Rüpurr). Die zentralen Wohnungen sind meistens Altbauwohnungen. Ich habe meine über studenten-wg.de gefunden. Allgemein gilt jedoch: Umso früher man sucht, umso besser. Für einen Eindruck von Karlsruhe kann man sich meine Photo-Spheres anschauen.","tags":"German posts","title":"Informatik am KIT"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/gedanken-zur-bundestagswahl-2013/","text":"Am 22. September 2013 findet die Bundestagswahl 2013 statt. Worum geht es? Parteien Ich werde jeweils zwei Videos verlinken. Eines von „MrWissen2go\" und einen Wahlwerbespot der Parteien selbst.

( Quelle ) Die FDP will nur mit der Union eine Koalition. ( Quelle ) Rot-Rot-Grün wird es nicht geben. ( Quelle , siehe auch im Wahlprogramm der Grünen: „Die Linke steht abseits des grünen Wandels.\") Die SPD will eigentlich nur mit den Grünen. ( Quelle ) Nun kann man Umfrageergebnisse betrachten: Umfrageergebnisse zur Bundestagswahl 2013 Quelle: wahlrecht.de Damit steht fest: CDU / CSU bleibt in der Regierung. Wenn die FDP die 5%-Hürde schafft, gibt es wieder Schwarz-Gelb. Sonst wirds vielleicht interessant, aber vermutlich Schwarz-Rot Themen Ich finde es interessant, welche Themen für die Parteien wichtig sind und welche in der Öffentlichkeit häufig diskutiert werden. Im folgenden mal einige Themen, die meiner Meinung nach wichtig sind. Sozialer Ausgleich Ich denke, dass in Deutschland die viel zitierte „Schere zwischen Arm und Reich\" zu groß wird. Zu dem Thema gibt es in den Wiki-Artikeln Einkommensverteilung in Deutschland und Vermögensverteilung in Deutschland viele Informationen, z.B.: 2008 betrug nach Zahlen des DIW das mittlere verfügbare Einkommen 1.252 Euro die ärmsten 50% haben 1,4% des Vermögens in Deutschland die Top 0,1 % haben 22,5% des Vermögens in Deutschland die Top 10% haben 66,6% des Vermögens in Deutschland 5 Mio. verdienen weniger als 8,50 Euro pro Stunde ( Quelle ) Im Jahr 2011 sind an mehr als 1,21 Millionen Bedarfsgemeinschaften mit Aufstockern durchschnittlich 737 Euro je Monat gezahlt worden. ( Quelle ) Es ist sehr einfach, was dagegen hilft: Höhere Steuern auf höhere Einkommen Mindestlohn Höhere Sozialleistungen für Arme Höhe Erbschaftsvermögen (um eine konkrete Zahl zu nennen: > 10,000,000 Euro) müssen stark mit Erbschaftssteuer eingeschränkt werden. Davor darf es keine „Steuerflucht\" geben. (Existiert dieses Problem?) Ich bin außerdem davon überzeugt, dass viele Menschen, die eigentlich Anspruch auf Sozialleistungen hätten, diesen nicht in Anspruch nehmen. Zum einen, weil sie es nicht wollen ( Quelle ), zum anderen aber vermutlich auch, weil sie nicht wissen, dass sie Anspruch haben. Hier mal ein paar Leistungen, die es gibt: Arbeitslosengeld Arbeitslosengeld II BAföG Hartz IV Kinderzulage Kindergeld Kinderkrankengeld Elterngeld Übergangsgeld Wohngeld Wohnungshilfe In der Kategorie:Sozialleistung (Deutschland) findet man noch viel mehr. Eurokrise Die Eurokrise muss beendet werden. Wichtige Zahlen dazu sind: Die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in Spanien betrug 2012 ca. 24,9%. Griechenland: Arbeitslosigkeit bei Menschen mit Hochschulbildung unter 24 Jahren: 28,8% - in Deutschland 12,8% In Griechenland betrug die Arbeitslosigkeit 2011 ca. 17,6% Die Staatverschuldung ist katastrophal - egal ob man Deutschland, Frankreich, Spanien, Griechenland oder Italien anschaut. Hier kann man nicht davon ausgehen, dass irgendeine Partei eine belegbar gute Lösung vorbringt. Wie auch? Das Problem gab es noch nie. Aber die Frage nach dem, was man zu tun gedenkt ist doch interessant: CDU / CSU: Für: Sparmaßnahmen, Schuldenbremse, Stabilitätspakt , Europäische Bankenunion Gegen: Eurobonds SPD: Für: Finanztransaktionssteuer DIE LINKE.: Für: Einmalige Abgabe von 10% auf Vermögen zur Schuldentilgung bei einem Freibetrag von 1.000.000 Euro auf Privatvermögen und 2.000.000 Euro auf Betriebsvermögen; Finanztransaktionssteuer Piraten: Für: Finanztransaktionssteuer; Schuldenschnitte Grüne: Für: Vermögensabgabe (vergleichbar mit LINKE) Das ist selbstverständlich keine vollständige Liste. Wenn es einen wirklich interessiert, sollte man das Wahlprogramm der Parteien danach durchsuchen. Korruption und Transparenz Korruption kann dazu führen, dass Entscheidungen getroffen werden, die für den Staat nicht optimal sind. Dazu sollte Abgeordnetenbestechung zuerst einmal illegal sein, also ein „Anti-Korruptionsgesetz\" eingeführt werden. Dagegen wehren sich aber CDU/CSU und FDP sehr. Es gab auch schon eine Abstimmung Schärfere Regeln gegen Abgeordnetenbestechung - kontrolliert doch selbst, wie eure Abgeordneten abgestimmt haben. Außerdem führt der Verdacht auf bestechliche Politiker zu weiterer Politikverdrossenheit. Siehe zu Abgeordnetenbestechung: Blockade bei Abgeordnetenbestechung Abgeordnetenbestechung: Mit wem will Seehofer eigentlich eine Gesetzesverschärfung durchsetzen? Überraschung: Bundestag soll doch noch über Abgeordnetenbestechung abstimmen Energiewende Die Versorgung mit Energie ist ein essentieller bestandteil der öffentlichen Infrastruktur. Sei es in Form von elektrischer Energie für Haushalte und Firmen, in Form von Wärme oder in Form von Mobilität. Dabei wäre es schön, das Problem nachhaltig zu lösen. Momentan geschieht dies in Form von On - und Offshore Windkraftparks sowie im Netzausbau . Das Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) soll dabei helfen und regelt die sog. Einspeisevergütung . Steuern Im Bezug auf Steuern sehe ich zwei große Probleme: Konzerne spielen Länder gegeneinander aus Steuern sind in Deutschland kompliziert Das Konzerne Länder gegeneinander ausspielen, sieht man an Google ( Quelle ). Versteht mich jetzt nicht falsch, ich finde Google super. Aber jedes Unternehmen wird, wenn es ihm auf legale Art möglich ist, versuchen Kosten (also auch Steuern) so niedrig wie möglich zu halten. Also sollte man sich doch innerhalb der Euro-Zone auf ein gemeinsames Steuersystem einigen können, oder? Außerdem scheint es mir in Deutschland zu viele Steuern/Abgaben zu geben und diese auch zu kompliziert zu sein Sinnvoll finde ich Erbschaftssteuer: Sie sorgt dafür, dass sich Reichtum weniger stark anhäuft. Umsatzsteuer : Sie stellt einen einfachen Weg dar, wie der Staat an Geld kommt. Sie betrifft alle gleichmäßig. Ich finde es nicht sinnvoll, hier zwischen verschiedenen Klassen (Lebensmittel, Luxusgüter) zu unterscheiden. Wenn Lebensmittel mehr kosten würden, würde man ihren Wert vielleicht mehr schätzen. Einkommensteuer: Auch mit der Lohnsteuer bekommt der Staat viel Geld. Aber im Gegensatz zur Umsatzsteuer kann man hier Leute, die viel Verdienen stärker belasten. Energiesteuern: Durch Energiesteuern kann man Anreize schaffen, sparsame Geräte / Infrastruktur zu entwickeln. Dies sollte für die Bürger auf lange Sicht von Vorteil sein. Rauschmittelsteuern : Eigentlich sollten Menschen nicht rauchen und saufen. Also sollten diese Produkte - obwohl sie eventuell billig in der Herstellung sind - teuer verkauft werden. Die Steuer sollte süchtigen dazu dienen, von ihrer Sucht frei zu kommen bzw. in die Suchtprävention gesteckt werden. Grundsteuer: Durch eine hohe Grundsteuer nutzt vermutlich derjenige, der am meisten damit verdienen kann, das Grundstück. Sie kann also eine gute Verteilung dieser knappen Ressource ermöglichen. Steuern/Abgaben die ich nicht verstehe, sind: Solidaritätszuschlag Kirchensteuer : Das sollte die Kirche selbst machen! Arbeitslosenversicherung: Sollte durch Umsatz- und Einkommenssteuer gedeckt werden. Grundstätzlich denke ich sollte hier jeder gleich versichert sein. Wenn jemand mehr als grundlegende Leistungen will, soll er das Privat machen. Aber eine gewisse Grundsicherung soll jeder bekommen. Krankenversicherung: Siehe Arbeitslosenversicherung Pflegeversicherung: Siehe Arbeitslosenversicherung Tabak, Alkopop, Schaumwein: Sollte eine „Rauschmittelsteuer\" sein Grunderwerbssteuer : Warum wird Grunderwerb extra gezählt? Warum nicht einfach nur Umsatzsteuer? Kapitalertragsteuer : Warum ist das nicht einfach Einkommenssteuer? Versicherungsteuer, Kraftfahrzeugsteuer : Siehe Grunderwerbsteuer Stromsteuer: Inwiefern unterscheided sie sich von der Energiesteuer? Ganz allgemein sollte es wenig S1teuern geben. Die Steuer die es gibt, sollten einfach zu verstehen und zu berechnen sein. Außerdem sollte es eine vollständige, aktuelle, frei verfügbare Liste der Steuern sowie der Berechnung selbiger geben. Ich weiß nicht, wie die Lohnsteuer berechnet wird. Sinnvoll würde ich folgende Berechnung finden: Am Ende eines Jahres wird das Einkommen (Lohn, Kapitalerträge) berechnet. Sei dieses Gesamteinkommen \\(x\\) (in Euro): \\(x \\leq 12.000\\) : Keine Steuer \\(x \\leq 24.000\\) : 15% Steuer. Die zu bezahlende Steuer ist also \\((x - 12.000) \\cdot \\frac{15}{100}\\) \\(x \\leq 36.000\\) : 20% Steuer. Die zu bezahlende Steuer ist also \\((36.000 - 12.000) \\cdot \\frac{15}{100} + (x-24.000) \\cdot \\frac{20}{100}\\) ... \\(x > 120.000\\) : 50% Steuer. Die zu bezahlende Steuer ist also \\((36.000 - 12.000) \\cdot \\frac{15}{100} + (36.000-24.000) \\cdot \\frac{20}{100} + \\dots + (x-120.000) \\cdot \\frac{50}{100}\\) Bitte hängt euch nicht an den Zahlen auf. Das sollte nur das System veranschaulichen. Mit diesem System wäre es ganz einfach zu berechnen, wer wieviel zahlen muss. Damit kann es auch nicht passieren, dass jemand trotz höherem Einkommen weniger Geld hat. Hier mal eine Grafik über das Steueraufkommen in Deutschland: Steueraufkommen in Deutschland (Stand: 2008) Es gibt noch den Ansatz der „ Flat Tax \", die Steuern einfacher machen soll. Ob das sinnvoll ist, kann ich nicht sagen. Aber eine Vereinfachung verbunden mit einer Europäischen Vereinheitlichung könnte Firmen entlasten und Steuerschlupflöcher schließen. Bürgerrechte Im Spähskandal (NSA, Prism, Tempora, Xkeyscore, ...) hat die CDU/CSU bisher nichts gemacht, um für Aufklärung und Beendigung der illegalen Praktiken zu sorgen. In einigen anderen Berechen wurden jedoch kritische Gesetze/Projekte/Aussagen umgesetzt/gestartet/gemacht: Verkauf von Meldedaten, manchmal auch „Bestandsdatenauskunft\" genannt ( Quelle ) Mehr Videoüberwachung Friedrich nimmt NSA in Schutz Vorratsdatenspeicherung (siehe Abstimmung , EU-Richtlinie ) Aber auch die SPD scheint in dem NSA-Skandal nicht ganz unbeteiligt zu sein ( Quelle ). Auch die Vorratsdatenspeicherung haben sie mit beschlossen. Die Grünen und Piraten sind gegen Videoüberwachung, wollen das Fernmeldegeheimnis zu einem Kommunikations- und Mediennutzungsgeheimnis ausweiten, gegen die Bestandsdatenauskunft vorgehen und Vorratsdatenspeicherung verhindern. Kleine Themen Mit folgenden Themen scheinen die Parteien ihren Wahlkampf zu betreiben. Obwohl sie für einzelne Leute sehr wichtig sein mögen, glaube ich das sie im großen und ganzen zu vernachlässigen sind. Verglichen mit den obigen Themen betreffen die folgenden Themen nur wenige Leute. Einiges davon habe ich aus dem Wahl-o-mat : Adoptionsrecht / Gleichstellung für Homosexuelle Betreuungsgeld Syrien-Krise Generelles Tempolimit auf Autobahnen NATO-Austritt Deutschlands; Rüstungsexporte; Militärische Beteiligungen Deutschlands Aufnahme von mehr Flüchtigen Einwanderung Lohnersatzleistungen bei Pflege von Angehörigen Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten Renteneintrittsalter Ehegattensplitting Autobahn-Maut für Ausländer Abschließende Worte Dieser Artikel stellt nur eine kurze Zusammenfassung von Gedanken dar, die mir wichtig oder interessant zu sein scheinen. Bitte denkt über die Themen nach und überlegt euch: Bin ich mit der Politik der letzten 4 Jahre zufrieden? Was ist mir wichtig? Wenn man nur auf die grobe Ausrichtung der Parteien betrachtet, kann man eventuell sagen: Wenn man Grundsätzlich mit der Politik der letzten Jahre zufrieden ist, sollte man CDU/CSU wählen. Wenn man Wert auf Transparenz legt, und will das Internetkompetenz in das Parlament kommt, sollte man die Piraten wählen. Wenn man auf Umweltschutz, neue (aber nicht radikale) Ideen, wert legt, sollte man die Grünen wählen Wenn man extreme Änderungen im sozialen Bereich will, sollte man DIE LINKE wählen. Wenn man CDU/CSU und FDP wieder sehen will, und will das auf Datenschutz-Aspekte mehr wert gelegt wird, sollte man FDP wählen. SPD: Hmm ... wenn man das gleiche in Rot will, was man schon kennt? Ich kann keinen wirklichen Themenschwerpunkt finden, in dem sich die SPD stark von der CDU/CSU abhebt. Wenn es euch irgendwie kümmert, was in Deutschland passiert, solltet ihr wählen gehen.

Does it make a difference if I use + or \\(\\cdot\\) as operators? Let \\(M := (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z},+)\\) and \\(N := (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z},+)\\) be groups and \\(\\varphi: M \\rightarrow N\\) be a group homomorphism. Let \\(H := \\{\\varphi: M \\rightarrow N\\}\\) Some fundamental theorems (which I'm not going to prove) are: \\(\\varphi(M)\\) is a group. \\(K_\\varphi := \\{m \\in M | \\varphi(m) = e_N\\}\\) is a group. Lagrange's theorem : \\(H \\leq G \\Rightarrow \\#H | \\# G\\) \\(\\varphi(1)\\) defines the complete homomorphism as \\(\\varphi(n) = \\varphi(1 + (n-1)) = \\varphi(1) + \\varphi(n-1)\\) \\(\\varphi(1) = 0\\) is always a homomorphism (that maps everything to 0). $m = n$ Theorem : \\(n=m \\Rightarrow |H|=n\\) Proof : You can map \\(1\\) to \\(n\\) values \\(\\stackrel{(IV)}{\\Rightarrow}\\) there can't be more than \\(n\\) homomorphisms. For every \\(i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}\\) exists an homomorphism \\(\\varphi_i(1) = i\\) : \\begin{align} \\varphi(a) + \\varphi(b) &= (ai \\mod n) + (bi \\mod n)\\\\ &= ai + bi \\mod n\\\\ &= (a+b)i \\mod n\\\\ &= \\varphi(a+b) \\end{align} This means, that all of them are actually homomorphisms. For different \\(i,j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}\\) the homomorphisms \\(\\varphi_i\\) and \\(\\varphi_j\\) are different. So we really have \\(n\\) homomorphisms \\(\\blacksquare\\) My first thought was that it's only a permutation, but \\(m \\in M\\) 0 1 2 3 4 5 \\(\\varphi(m) \\in N\\) 0 3 0 3 0 3 is not a permutation, but a homomorphism. Distinct primes Theorem : \\(n, m \\in \\mathbb{P}, n \\neq m \\Rightarrow |H| = 1\\) Proof : Let \\(n, m \\in \\mathbb{P}, n \\neq m\\) . Part 1 : \\(1 \\leq |H|\\) This follows directly from (V). Part 2 : \\(|H| \\leq 1\\) We know that \\begin{align} \\stackrel{(I)+(III)}{\\Rightarrow} &\\# \\varphi(M) | \\# N\\\\ \\stackrel{n \\in \\mathbb{P}}{\\Rightarrow} &\\# \\varphi(M) \\in \\{1, n\\} \\end{align} and \\begin{align} \\stackrel{(II)+(III)}{\\Rightarrow} &\\# K_\\varphi | \\# M\\\\ \\stackrel{m \\in \\mathbb{P}}{\\Rightarrow} &\\# K_\\varphi \\in \\{1, m\\} \\end{align} Case 1: \\(m > n\\) Now the kernel can't be trivial anymore, so \\(\\# K_\\varphi = m\\) . This means that everything is mapped to 0. There is only one homomorphism that does so. Case 2: \\(m < n\\) Now the image \\(\\varphi(M)\\) can't be all of \\(N\\) . This means \\(\\varphi(M) = 1\\) which is again the 0-mapping \\(\\blacksquare\\) Any $n$ and $m$ Theorem : \\(|H| = gcd(n, m)\\) Proof : First a sanity check: The theorems above are special cases of this theorem. Let's try to prove it. Let \\(n\\) be composed of primes \\(p_1, \\dots, p_x\\) (where \\(p_i = p_j\\) is allowed). Then \\(N = \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p_2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p_x\\mathbb{Z}\\) according to the Chinese remainder theorem . The same is true for \\(M\\) . As there are \\(p_i\\) homomorphisms between \\(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}/p_j\\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(p_i = p_j\\) and as you can take a \\(p_i\\) from the left and a \\(p_j\\) from the right you can combine the different homomorphisms. So it is basically a combinatoric problem. As everything (except for same primes) will only have 1 homomorphism, you have to multiply the number of homomophisms for each pair \\((p_i, p_j)\\) . But this is simply the gcd \\(\\blacksquare\\) $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)$ What changes when we use \\((\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)\\) and \\((\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)\\) ? Well, first of all \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have to be primes. Otherwise, not every element would have an inverse. Second, you have to exclude 0. Which means we only use units: \\((\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)&#94;\\times\\) and \\((\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot)&#94;\\times\\) According to the German Wikipedia ( source ): $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})&#94;\\times$ is cyclic $:\\Leftrightarrow n \\in \\{p&#94;r, 2p&#94;r | p \\in \\mathbb{P}, r \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}\\}$ So there is no simple way to reduce it to the same proofs.

How I've got the job This was kind of funny. I send Prof. Dr. Asfour some notes of passages that could be improved (mainly typos). About two days later he proposed me to correct it by myself. Another day later I signed the contract. I've never signed a contract that fast. What I did My job was to correct errors (German language, statements about computer science and LaTeX), find parts that were outdated and update them, find sections that were difficult to understand and simplify them and to make it easier to make changes in the future (Well, I don't think Prof. Dr. Asfour thought this was my job ... but I think it's important.) So Prof. Dr. Asfour created a SVN repository with all LaTeX sources of the latest lecture notes (which were already great!). He also sent me Emails he received from students who mentioned errors just like I did and some notes from a tutor who tried to improve the script some time ago.

Why? Because it is relevant for everybody. Suppose you go to the doctor to make a cancer test. The test is positive. That means you have cancer, right? Wrong! Basics A probability is a numerical value in [0, 1] that is assigned to events (or lets rather say outcomes of an experiment). A probability can never be less than zero and never be more than one. The sum of all probabilities of all outcomes of one experiment is always 1. Example: Your experiment \\(x\\) could be throwing a coin. The outcome of your experiment is either head or tails. So if \\(Pr[x = \\text{head}] = 0.6\\) , then \\(Pr[x = \\text{tail}] = 0.4\\) . Now you might argue that the coin can also stand on its border. This would result in a different model of the situation with different probabilities, e.g.: \\(Pr[x = \\text{head}] = 0.559\\) , \\(Pr[x = \\text{border}] = 0.001\\) and \\(Pr[x = \\text{tail}] = 0.4\\) . Another very important rule is Bayes rule: \\(Pr[A|B] = \\frac{Pr[B|A] \\cdot Pr[A]}{Pr[B]}\\) This works also with more variables: \\(Pr[A|BC] = \\frac{Pr[B|AC] \\cdot Pr[A|C]}{Pr[B|C]}\\) Cancer Lets say the probability of having cancer is \\(Pr[C] = 0.01\\) . This means the probability of not having cancer is \\(Pr[\\neg C] = 0.99\\) . Now you have cancer tests. They can either be positive (+) which means they say you have cancer. Or they are negative (-), which means according to the test, you don't have cancer. They are not always working as expected. So you get so called \"false positives\" and \"false negatives\". A false positive is a positive result, while it should be negative. So the test says you have cancer, while you don't have cancer. It is denoted by \\(Pr[+ | \\neg C] = 0.2\\) . A false negative is a negative result, while it should be positive. So the test says you don't have cancer, but you actually have cancer. It is denoted by \\(Pr[- | C] = 0.1\\) . You should note that \\(Pr[+ | \\neg C] + Pr[- | C] = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3 \\neq 1\\) . Why is this the case? Because the test might also not be related at all to you having cancer. But \\(Pr[+ | \\neg C] + Pr[- | \\neg C]\\) has to be 1 and \\(Pr[+ | C] + Pr[- | C]\\) also has to be one. So you can draw this table: $Pr[\\text{Testresult}|\\text{Cancer}]$ $C$ $\\neg C$ $+$ $0.9$ $0.2$ $-$ $0.1$ $0.8$ You can see that the correct results are much more likely than the wrong ones. Some intermediate results How likely is a positive / negative test result? \\begin{align} Pr[+] &= Pr[+|C] \\cdot Pr[C] + Pr[+| \\neg C] \\cdot Pr[\\neg C] = 0.207\\\\ Pr[-] &= Pr[-|C] \\cdot Pr[C] + Pr[-| \\neg C] \\cdot Pr[\\neg C] = 0.793 \\end{align} How likely are the combinations? (This time you don't know if you have cancer): $Pr[\\text{Testresult}, \\text{Cancer}]$ $C$ $\\neg C$ $+$ $0.009$ $0.198$ $-$ $0.001$ $0.792$ Reversing it It is quite likely that you would like to know how likely it is that you have cancer. Without a test, you know: \\begin{align} Pr[C] &= 0.01\\\\ Pr[\\neg C] &= 0.99 \\end{align} Now you get a positive test result. How likely is it that you have cancer? In other words: Calculate \\(Pr[C|+]\\) \\begin{align} Pr[C|+] &= \\frac{Pr[C, +]}{Pr[+]} = \\frac{0.009}{0.207} = \\frac{1}{23} \\approx 0.043\\\\ Pr[\\neg C|+] &= 1 - \\frac{1}{23} = \\frac{22}{23} \\approx 0.957\\\\ Pr[C|-] &= \\frac{0.001}{0.793} = \\frac{1}{793} \\approx 0.001\\\\ Pr[\\neg C|-] &= 1 - \\frac{1}{793} = \\frac{792}{793} \\approx 0.999 \\end{align} How would you interpret these results? I'd say: When you get a positive result you shouldn't really worry. But perhaps you should make other tests. When you get a negative results you can be very sure that you don't have cancer. Testing again A very natural approach to a positive test result might be taking the same test again. How does this influence the probability? There are four possibilities what could have happened: You have cancer: Second test was negative Second test was positive You don't have cancer: Second test was negative Second test was positive First of all, I compare some intermediate results \\begin{align} Pr[++] &= Pr[C] \\cdot Pr[+|C] \\cdot Pr[+|C] + Pr[\\neg C] \\cdot Pr[+|\\neg C] \\cdot Pr[+|\\neg C]\\\\ &= 0.477 \\neq 0.042849 = 0.207&#94;2 = (Pr[+])&#94;2\\\\ Pr[+-] &= Pr[C] \\cdot Pr[+|C] \\cdot Pr[-|C] + Pr[\\neg C] \\cdot Pr[+|\\neg C] \\cdot Pr[-|\\neg C] \\\\ &= 0.01 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.1 + 0.99 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot 0.8\\\\ &= 0.1593\\\\ Pr[C,+,+] &= Pr[C] \\cdot Pr[+ | C]&#94;2 = 0.01 \\cdot 0.9&#94;2 = 0.0081\\\\ Pr[C,+,-] &= Pr[C] \\cdot Pr[+ | C] \\cdot Pr[-|C] = 0.01 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.0009\\\\ Pr[C|++] &= \\frac{Pr[C,+,+]}{Pr[++]} = \\frac{0.0081}{0.207&#94;2} = \\frac{9}{530} \\approx 0.170\\\\ Pr[C|+-] &= \\frac{Pr[C,+,-]}{Pr[+-]} = \\frac{0.0009}{0.1593} = \\frac{1}{177} \\approx 0.006 \\end{align} Woooha! So if one test says you have cancer, don't worry. When two tests say you have cancer, you have a 17% chance of having cancer. On the other hand: One negative and one positive test is better than no test at all, because without a test you have a probability of 0.01 to have cancer. With both tests, you only have a probability of 0.006. Why probability is important for you As you might have seen, your intuition about probability is wrong. But we hear numbers all the time. It is important for us to understand them, so we should drop our intuition and learn how to use those numbers.","tags":"Mathematics","title":"Why everybody should know about conditional probability"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/kollisionsresistente-hashfunktionen-und-einwegfunktionen/","text":"Definitionen Sei $f:X \\rightarrow Y$ eine Funktion. $f$ heißt eine Einwegfunktion, genau dann wenn für alle $x \\in X$ gilt: $y := f(x)$ kann in Polynomialzeit berechnet werden Für die Berechnung eines Urbildes $x$ aus $y$ existiert kein randomisierter Algorithmus, der in Polynomialzeit läuft.

Then he might know that MySQL uses INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables . He might enter this into the title input element: ' UNION SELECT table_name, table_type FROM information_schema.tables WHERE ' 1 '=' 1 which results in this query: SELECT * FROM ` movies ` WHERE title = '' UNION SELECT table_name , table_type FROM information_schema . tables WHERE '1' = '1' which gives: Attacker got all table names This way, the attacker gets all table names from all databases on this machine. So he essentially can get everything stored in your database.

The hard disk of this computer contains 53 GB of data (on Linux: df -H ). As my home folder only contains 35.3 GB of data, 17.7 GB seem to be programs. 21.1 GB the remaining data is for movies and 6.1 GB are for programming (and backed up via GitHub). Hence the by far biggest part of the lost data would be movies, the rest would be scattered across my home folder. The situation is similar for my external hard drive: A lot of video files, some audio files, A LOT of pictures and many, many miscellaneous files. I don't want to lose data, but I don't use my external HDD often. Most of the time I only have to do a RegEx search for file names (sometimes also a full text search for some files I found via RegEx) just to find out that the file I'm looking for is not there. Online Services I want to back up one computer with at least 200 GB which I don't need to access often and 10 GB that need to access often. A backup service should include software, that ... ... allows me to configurate upload / dowload bandwidth limts ... should integrate into my os in such a way that it feels like using a hard disk ... lets me upload files of sizes up to 5 GB ... uploads in background automatically as soon as my notebook gets an internet connection ... uploads only parts of files, if only parts changed ... starts uploading as soon as a file changed ... creates checksums and compares them to check if files were correctly uploaded A version control would be great, but that's a feature I don't expect. Also a possibility to share content (single files with a code) would be great, but I don't know if any of those services offers that. Name Euro / Year Free trial Clients Information Backblaze 37.06 Wiki Carbonite 46.78 Wiki CrashPlan 46.78 Wiki IDrive 116.58 - Jungle Disk 238.62 ? Wiki MiMedia 77.20 ? Wiki Mozy 131.00 Wiki Nomadesk 93.57 - SugarSync 194.94 Wiki Ubuntu One 187.09 Wiki I was a little bit surprised that there seems no way to use Google Drive as backup option (at least on Linux as there is this petition which was signed by 16,774 people). What could go wrong? A DOS attack against one of those companies might lead to temporarily unavailable services. Financial problems, bad backup techniques or personal mistakes might lead to permanent loss of data. Information might get leaked to the public. Information might get leaked to government ( PRISM , Tempora ) You might get analyzed by the company that stores your data. They could create a personal profile and sell that (maybe not even on the content you use, but perhaps only with filenames and edit times) The software you've installed for your backup might be a malware. The software you've installed might have security issues that allow attackers to execute malware. Offline RAID All RAID levels (except for RAID 0) offer redundancy. This means, they store data on more than one hard disk. This way, you can restore data after on (or if maybe more) hard disk crashes. But this is by no mean a guarantee that your data is secure. It's recommended to use RAID with a RAID controller (a dedicated piece of hardware). Otherwise, you need some software that does it and your CPU time gets wasted with these operations. What could go wrong: One disk fails. You buy a new one to get security back, the RAID controller copies information to the new disk that replaced the crashed one. While it copies, the other disk gets heavy load. This heavy load might lead to another crash. Boom. Your data is lost. Your computer might get damaged (e.g. by a fire, by an earthquake, by overvoltage, by a cup of tea you accidentally threw over it, by an act of agression ) A burglar would probably steal all hardware you have at home. But RAID is no option for me as I use a notebook as my main computer. External HDD A very easy way to secure your files is an external hard disk drive. You can choose by yourself what and when to save your files for redundancy. But as I know myself, I will make those backups less often after a while. So I guess this will not work for me. You could probably also make an external HDD raid.

I've got quite angry today because of that and thought about ways to improve the situation. A story from today: I've bought two tickets to get from Karlsruhe to Augsburg (230 km) in about a month. I wanted to visit my dad in summer break just after an exam. I've bought a fixed connection to get there for \"only\" 35 Euro instead of 59 Euro. But I've made a mistake, my conenction started to early. Two hours after having bought the tickets, I wanted to exchange them for a connection that starts later. But I had to pay 15 Euro for exchanging them, 15 Euro for canceling the connection. And it got worse: I had to give them my home address to get at least some of the money back. For what the hell do they need my home address? What could get improved? Most people basically choose one company: Deutsche Bahn It's too expensive. Customer service of \"Deutsche Bahn\" is very bad. Delays of at least 10 minutes always happen VERY often, delays of more than 30 minutes happen from time to time; I already had delay of more than 2 hours. Alternative companies Most people choose \"Deutsche Bahn\" (short: DB) because it is the biggest company that provides public transportation when you want to travel between cities. DB is well known and connects all big cities. However, there are alternatives. After a law (§ 13 Abs. 2 of the Personenbeförderungsgesetz ) was annulled, bus companies provided alternatives to traveling by train. Some companies are: MeinFernbus.de univers-reisen.de City2City.de But they are difficult to find and people maybe don't trust in them. Informing people Google Transit , FahrtenFuchs.de and Busliniensuche.de provide one possibility to inform people. But they all seem to have only a few bus companies. Google Transit is interesting as they provide format specification for exchanging transit information. What could be done Contact bus companies and ask them if they want to provide transit information to the public in Google Transit Feed Format. You might want to hint them to Google Transit Partner Program . I've contacted \"meinfernbus.de\" (Saturday, 06.07.2013). Lets see if they answer.

We want to find a function that goes through those points and approximates the underlying function that produced that points as good as possible. Polynomial interpolation The problem of polynomial interpolation were oscillations at the end of the interval you wanted to interpolate (see interactive example ): Oscillations you get with polynomial interpolation As you can see, polynomial interpolation with equally spaced points is very, very bad at the ends of the interval. Tschebyscheff spaced points are much better, but you can still see that the interpolated function is different from the original. Splines A way to solve this problem are splines. A spline is a piecewise-defined function that goes through some points (aka knots) and is smooth. More formally: Let \\(s: [x_0,x_n] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be a spline. Then: (S1) cubic : \\(\\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}: s|_{x_{i-1}, x_i}\\) is a cubic function (S2) interpolation : \\(\\forall i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}: s(x_i) = y_i\\) (S3) smooth : \\(s \\in C&#94;2([x_0, x_n])\\) and \\(\\int_{x_0}&#94;{x_n} s''(x)&#94;2 \\mathrm{d}x\\) is minimal When you use a cubic function \\(a x&#94;3 + b x&#94;2 + cx + d\\) for each of the \\(n\\) intervals that we got by our \\(n+1\\) points, you have \\(4n\\) variables that you need to calculate. Condition (S2) gives two equations per interval which makes \\(2n\\) equations of the form: $$ \\begin{align} y_i &= a_i x_i&#94;3 &&+ b_i x_i&#94;2 &&+ c_i x_i &&+ d_i\\\\ y_{i+1} &= a_i x_{i+1}&#94;3 &&+ b_i x_{i+1}&#94;2 &&+ c_i x_{i+1} &&+ d_i \\end{align} $$ At first glance condition (S3) - \\(s \\in C&#94;2([x_0, x_n])\\) - seems to be redundant with (S1) - \\(s\\) is piecewise cubic. Every polynomial is in \\(C&#94;\\infty(\\mathbb{R})\\) , so it certainly is in \\(C&#94;2([x_0, x_n])\\) . That's correct. But \\(s\\) is not a polynomial. It's only piecewise-defined as a polynomial. That makes a difference at the ends of the intervals. And it gives us \\(2n-2\\) more equations: $$\\displaystyle \\begin{align} s_i' (x_{i}) &= s_{i+1}'(x_{i}) \\;\\;\\; &&\\forall i=1, \\dots, n-1\\\\ s_i''(x_{i}) &= s_{i+1}''(x_{i}) \\;\\;\\; &&\\forall i=1, \\dots, n-1 \\end{align} $$ which is equivalent to $$\\displaystyle \\begin{align} 3a_i x_i&#94;2 + 2b_i x_i + c_i &= 3a_{i+1} x_i&#94;2 + 2b_{i+1} x_i + c_{i+1} \\;\\;\\; &&\\forall i=1, \\dots, n-1\\\\ 6a_i x_i + 2b_i &= 6a_{i+1} x_i + 2b_{i+1} \\;\\;\\; &&\\forall i=1, \\dots, n-1 \\end{align} $$ All equations we have are linear. Please note that the variables we want to determine are \\(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i\\) . So \\(x_i&#94;3\\) is simply a multiplicative constant that we have to evaluate before we solve our system of equations. But at the moment, we only have \\(2n+2\\cdot(n-1) = 4n -2\\) equations, but we have \\(4n\\) variables. So we need ancillary conditions to solve this linear system of equations. Possible ancillary conditions natural splines : $s''(x_0) =0, \\;\\;\\; s''(x_n) = 0$ clamped splines : $s'(x_0) = f'(x_0),\\;\\;\\; s'(x_n)= f'(x_n)$ where $y_0'$ and $y_n'$ can be any value periodic : $s'(x_0) = s'(x_n), \\;\\;\\; s''(x_0) = s''(x_n)$ not-a-knot : $s_1''' = s_2''', \\;\\;\\; s_{n-1}''' = s_{n}'''$ George MacKerron shows how the results can differ in his article Cubic splines in JavaScript (via CoffeeScript) : Different results for different ancillary conditions Code for natural splines I will store splines as a list of maps. Each map is one piece of the spline and has: \\(u\\) : Start of the interval \\(v\\) : End of the interval \\(a,b,c,d\\) : cubic function \\(ax&#94;3 + bx&#94;2 + cx +d\\) Please note that I didn't test the code below.

This is one of hundreds of images that you can use to test your algorithms. Link is below. Zero Mean Normalized Cross-Correlation or shorter ZNCC is an integer you can get when you compare two grayscale images. Lets say you have a webcam at a fixed position for security. It takes images all the time, but most of the time the room is empty. So quite a lot of images will not be interesting. They only waste space. So you want to get rid of those redundant images. BUT those images are not identical! Even if the scenery didn't change, your sensor will produce slightly different results. A human will not notice them, but you can't simply compare images bit by bit. Even if you could, the images will be different because the sun moved (and so do shadows) and perhaps you have a clock in the image. Now you can solve this problem with various techniques. I want to describe those techniques in a very general way. As the images in other scenarios might have different sizes and you probably don't want to compare whole images, I'll assume you have a part of both image of size \\((2n+1) \\times (2n+1)\\) . The pixel in the center has coordinates \\((u_1, v_1)\\) for the part of the first image and \\((u_2, v_2)\\) for the second image. Sum of squared differences Go through all pixels, get the difference of both and add up the squares: \\(\\displaystyle SSD(Img_1, Img_2, u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, n) := \\sum_{i=-n}&#94;n \\sum_{j=-n}&#94;n \\left ( Img_1(u_1+i, v_1+j) - Img_2(u_2 + i, v_2 + j) \\right )&#94;2\\) When SSD is small, both images are very similar. Wehn SSD is 0, the images are identical. Zero Mean Normalized Cross-Correlation The average gray value is: \\(\\displaystyle \\overline{Img}(u, v, n) := \\frac{1}{(2n+1)&#94;2} \\sum_{i=-n}&#94;n \\sum_{j=-n}&#94;n Img(u+i, v+j)\\) The standard deviation is: \\(\\displaystyle \\sigma(u, v, n) := \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(2n+1)&#94;2} \\left (\\sum_{i=-n} \\sum_{j=-n}&#94;n (Img(u +i, v+j)-\\overline{Img}(u, v, n))&#94;2 \\right )}\\) The ZNCC is defined as: \\(\\displaystyle ZNCC(Img_1, Img_2, u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, n) := \\frac{\\frac{1}{(2n+1)&#94;2}\\sum_{i=-n}&#94;n \\sum_{j=-n}&#94;n \\prod_{t=1}&#94;2 \\left (Img_t (u_t+i,v_t+j) - \\overline{Img}(u_t, v_t, n) \\right )}{\\sigma_1(u_1, v_1, n) \\cdot \\sigma_2(u_2, v_2, n)}\\) The higher the ZNCC gets, the more are those two images correlated. (I think the value is always in [0, 1]) Here is some Python code: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def getAverage ( img , u , v , n ): \"\"\"img as a square matrix of numbers\"\"\" s = 0 for i in range ( - n , n + 1 ): for j in range ( - n , n + 1 ): s += img [ u + i ][ v + j ] return float ( s ) / ( 2 * n + 1 ) ** 2 def getStandardDeviation ( img , u , v , n ): s = 0 avg = getAverage ( img , u , v , n ) for i in range ( - n , n + 1 ): for j in range ( - n , n + 1 ): s += ( img [ u + i ][ v + j ] - avg ) ** 2 return ( s ** 0.5 ) / ( 2 * n + 1 ) def zncc ( img1 , img2 , u1 , v1 , u2 , v2 , n ): stdDeviation1 = getStandardDeviation ( img1 , u1 , v1 , n ) stdDeviation2 = getStandardDeviation ( img2 , u2 , v2 , n ) avg1 = getAverage ( img1 , u1 , v1 , n ) avg2 = getAverage ( img2 , u2 , v2 , n ) s = 0 for i in range ( - n , n + 1 ): for j in range ( - n , n + 1 ): s += ( img1 [ u1 + i ][ v1 + j ] - avg1 ) * ( img2 [ u2 + i ][ v2 + j ] - avg2 ) return float ( s ) / (( 2 * n + 1 ) ** 2 * stdDeviation1 * stdDeviation2 ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : A = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 , 6 ],[ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] B1 = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 , 6 ],[ 7 , 8 , 9 ]] B2 = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 , 6 ],[ 7 , 8 , 7 ]] print ( zncc ( A , B1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 )) print ( zncc ( A , B2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 )) See also Feature point image matching Tsukuba University stereo images : Just in case you want to try those algorithms Correlation based similarity measures-Summary Bachelorarbeit : Bildvorverarbeitung und Bildähnlichkeitsfunktionen für beleuchtungstolerante visuelle Navigation (German)","tags":"Code","title":"Zero Mean Normalized Cross-Correlation"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/javascript-wtf/","text":"JavaScript is THE web programming language. It gets interpreted by your browser and web applications like Google Mail, Google Maps and Facebook make heavy use of them. Almost always, when you see something working smoothly / interactive, you see JavaScript in action. But JavaScript has a lot of \"features\" which are ... well, I don't have words for those. Just continue reading. Most of the following content is from a StackOverflow question Strangest language feature Weak typing Example console . log ( 3. . toString ()); Output '3' Explanation 3. is a floating point and can get converted to a string. But 3.toString() gives SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL Weak typing and string concatenation Example console . log ( '5' + 3 ); console . log ( '5' - 3 ); Output '53' 2 Explanation JavaScript automatically converts datatypes and + is used for string concatenation and for addition. In the first case, as the first datatype is a string and + is defined for strings as concatenation, JS converts 3 to '3' which results in the string '53' . In the second case, - is only defined for subtraction so '5' gets converted to a number (int? float? I don't know. I guess int.) Automatic semicolons Example 1 function test () { return { id : 1338 , title : 'This is a test' }; } console . log ( test ()); Example 2 function test () { return 2 + 2 ; } console . log ( test ()); Output 1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : Output 2 undefined Explanation JS adds a ; at every line end. Automatically. You can't prevent it. Please note that the second output is no error! It has a (valid) return value of undefined . Truth table Example console . log ( \"------- 0 == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( 0 == 0 ); console . log ( 0 == false ); console . log ( 0 == '' ); console . log ( 0 == null ); console . log ( 0 == undefined ); console . log ( 0 == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( 0 == '0' ); console . log ( 0 == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- false == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( false == false ); console . log ( false == '' ); console . log ( false == null ); console . log ( false == undefined ); console . log ( false == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( false == '0' ); console . log ( false == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- '' == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( '' == '' ); console . log ( '' == null ); console . log ( '' == undefined ); console . log ( '' == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( '' == '0' ); console . log ( '' == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- null == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( null == null ); console . log ( null == undefined ); console . log ( null == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( null == '0' ); console . log ( null == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- undefined == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( undefined == undefined ); console . log ( undefined == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( undefined == '0' ); console . log ( undefined == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- \\t\\r\\n == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == '0' ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- '0' == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( '0' == '0' ); console . log ( '0' == 'false' ); console . log ( \"------- 'false' == XYZ ---------\" ); console . log ( 'false' == 'false' ); console . log ( \"--------------------\" ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == 0 ---------\" ); console . log ( 0 == 0 ); console . log ( false == 0 ); console . log ( '' == 0 ); console . log ( null == 0 ); console . log ( undefined == 0 ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == 0 ); console . log ( '0' == 0 ); console . log ( 'false' == 0 ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == false ---------\" ); console . log ( false == false ); console . log ( '' == false ); console . log ( null == false ); console . log ( undefined == false ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == false ); console . log ( '0' == false ); console . log ( 'false' == false ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == '' ---------\" ); console . log ( '' == '' ); console . log ( null == '' ); console . log ( undefined == '' ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == '' ); console . log ( '0' == '' ); console . log ( 'false' == '' ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == null ---------\" ); console . log ( null == null ); console . log ( undefined == null ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == null ); console . log ( '0' == null ); console . log ( 'false' == null ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == undefined ---------\" ); console . log ( undefined == undefined ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == undefined ); console . log ( '0' == undefined ); console . log ( 'false' == undefined ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == \\t\\r\\n ---------\" ); console . log ( \" \\t\\r\\n\" == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( '0' == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( 'false' == \" \\t\\r\\n\" ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == '0' ---------\" ); console . log ( '0' == '0' ); console . log ( 'false' == '0' ); console . log ( \"------- XYZ == 'false' ---------\" ); console . log ( 'false' == 'false' ); Output == 0 false '' null undefined \" \\t\\r\\n\" '0' 'false' 0 true true true false false true true false false true true true false false true true false '' true true true false false false false false null false false false true true false false false undefined false false false true true false false false \" \\t\\r\\n\" true true false false false true false false '0' true true false false false false true false 'false' false false false false false false false true Explanation Wow. This is fucked up. I've expected that strings compared to anything that is not the string itself evaluates to false. At least the table is symmetric and the diagonal is true. Please also note that JavaScript has a === operator. The truth Example console . log ( 2 == [ 2 ]); console . log ( 2 == [[ 2 ]]); Output true true Explanation At StackOverflow Date Example var futureDate = new Date ( 2010 , 77 , 154 ); console . log ( futureDate ); console . log ( futureDate . getYear ()); Output Tue Nov 01 2016 00 :00:00 GMT+0100 ( CET ) 116 Explanation 77 months and 154 days from the 0th day of 0th month of 2010 You should use getFullYear() instead of getYear() , as the later one returns year - 1900 (Why? When is this useful?) Integer overflow Example console . log ( 111111111111111111111 ); Output 111111111111111110000 Explanation It's ok that JavaScript fails at handling this integer. I think it converts this to a float, but I'm not sure about that. But no matter what it does here, it doesn't throw an error. That's bad. How is a developer supposed to know in a big application know when something went wrong? Function parameters In Javascript, declaring the parameters a function accepts is only a convenience to the programmer. All variables passed through the function call are accessible by the keyword arguments . So the following would alert \"world\": \u0002wzxhzdk:16\u0003 Source on StackOverflow Global variables Example var a = 12 ; function test () { a = 1337 ; } test (); console . log ( a ); Output 1337 Explanation When you forget to use var inside of test() you might accidentally use a global variable.

Polynomials \\(\\displaystyle \\mathbb{R}_n[X] := \\left \\{p:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} | p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}&#94;n a_i \\cdot x&#94;i \\text{ with } a_0, \\dots, a_n \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right \\}\\) So \\(\\mathbb{R}_n[X]\\) are all polynomials with real coefficients and degree not higher than latex]n \\(. $\\mathbb{R}_n[X]\\) forms a vector space for \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) . The degree of that vector space is \\(n+1\\) . What does that mean? This means you can use different bases for polynomials. The base we usually use for \\(\\mathbb{R}_n[X]\\) is \\(\\{x&#94;0, x&#94;1, x&#94;2, x&#94;3, \\dots\\}\\) , but you can switch the base. Lagrange interpolation Define \\(n+1\\) polynomials like this: \\(\\displaystyle L_{i}(x) := \\prod_{j=0 \\atop j \\neq i}&#94;n \\frac{x-x_j}{x_i - x_j}\\) This means: \\(\\displaystyle L_{i}(x_i) := \\prod_{j=0 \\atop j \\neq i}&#94;n \\frac{x_i-x_j}{x_i - x_j} = 1\\) and \\(\\displaystyle L_{i}(x_p) := \\prod_{j=0 \\atop j \\neq i}&#94;n \\frac{x_p-x_j}{x_i - x_j} = 0 \\;\\; p \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}\\) So the polynomial \\(y_i \\cdot L_{i}(x)\\) fits the point \\((x_i, y_i)\\) and is zero for all other points. This implies that \\(\\displaystyle p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}&#94;n y_i \\cdot L_i(x)\\) is an interpolation of our data points. The degree of \\(p(x)\\) is not higher than \\(n\\) . You can see that easily when you take a look at the definition of \\(p(x)\\) and \\(L_i(x)\\) . The polynomials \\(L_i(x)\\) form another base for \\(\\mathbb{R}_n[X]\\) . Lagranges way to interpolate polynomials can be implemented like this: def lagrangeInterpolation ( points ): p = [] for i in range ( len ( points )): Li = { \"y\" : points [ i ][ \"y\" ], \"polynomial\" :[]} for j in range ( len ( points )): if j == i : continue Li [ \"polynomial\" ] . append ({ \"sub\" : points [ j ][ \"x\" ], \"divisor\" : points [ i ][ \"x\" ] - points [ j ][ \"x\" ] }) p . append ( Li ) return p def evaluateLagrangePolynomial ( p , x ): y = 0 for Li in p : prod = 1 for term in Li [ \"polynomial\" ]: prod *= ( x - term [ \"sub\" ]) / term [ \"divisor\" ] y += Li [ \"y\" ] * prod return y Time complexity to get the polynomial: \\(n&#94;2 + \\mathcal{O}(n)\\) (where \\(n\\) is the number of points) Space complexity for the polynomial: \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) (where \\(n\\) is the number of points) Time complexity to evaluate the value of \\(p(x)\\) for any \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) : \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) . Newton interpolation Define \\(\\displaystyle N_i(x) := \\prod_{j=0}&#94;{i-1} (x-x_j)\\) So you know that \\(N_i(x) = 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\exists p \\in \\{1, \\dots, i\\}: x = x_{i-p}\\) So your polynomial is \\(\\displaystyle p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}&#94;n c_i \\cdot N_i(x)\\) for the correct \\(c_i\\) . You can do this by solving the following system of equations. Please note that you don't have to store that matrix to get those \\(c_i\\) , divided differences are better. $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & & & & 0 \\\\ 1 & (x_1 - x_0) & & & \\\\ 1 & (x_2 - x_0) & (x_2 - x_0)(x_2 - x_1) & & \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\ddots & \\\\ 1 & (x_n - x_0) & \\cdots & & \\prod_{i=0}&#94;{n-1}(x_n - x_i) \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} f_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_n \\end{pmatrix}$$ You can get this lower triangular matrix like this: def getGaussSystemForNewton ( points ): n = len ( points ) - 1 A = [[ 0 for i in range ( n + 2 )] for j in range ( n + 1 )] for j in range ( 0 , n + 2 ): for i in range ( j , n + 1 ): if j == 0 : A [ i ][ j ] = 1 else : A [ i ][ j ] = A [ i ][ j - 1 ] * ( points [ i ][ \"x\" ] - points [ j - 1 ][ \"x\" ]) if j == n + 1 : for i in range ( 0 , n ): A [ i ][ j ] = points [ i ][ \"y\" ] return A From my previous posts about solving equations of upper triangular matrices and lower unitriangular matrices you know that the space complexity of this is in \\(\\Theta(n&#94;2)\\) .

It's not getting better when I pipe this through bash.

So I could buffer some and write them in blocks. I could also just write blocks of unsigned long numbers instead of a string representation. This might lead to a much smaller file size which in consequence is faster to write: #include <stdio.h> // fopen #include <iostream> // atoi #include <vector> using namespace std ; void sieveOfEratosthenes ( unsigned long n ) { FILE * pFile ; pFile = fopen ( \"huge-prime-list.txt\" , \"wb\" ); vector < bool > primesEratosthenes ( n + 1 , true ); unsigned long tmp = 2 ; fwrite ( & tmp , sizeof ( unsigned long ), 1 , pFile ); for ( unsigned long i = 3 ; i < n ; i += 2 ) { if ( primesEratosthenes [ i ] == true ) { fwrite ( & i , sizeof ( unsigned long ), 1 , pFile ); for ( unsigned long j = 2 ; j * i <= n ; j ++ ) { primesEratosthenes [ j * i ] = false ; } } } fclose ( pFile ); } int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { unsigned long long n = ( unsigned long long ) atoi ( argv [ 1 ]); sieveOfEratosthenes ( n ); return 0 ; } And execute it: time ./generate-prime-list.out 1000000000 real 0m39.700s user 0m38.546s sys 0m0.640s 38 seconds for all primes from 2 to 1,000,000,000. The file size is now only 203.4 MB. By the way, simply setting this with setbuf(pFile, NULL); to unbuffered resulted in 50 seconds execution time. You can get the list with this snippet: #include <iostream> #include <fstream> using namespace std ; int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { if ( argc != 2 ) { cout << \"You have to specify a file name\" << endl ; } else { FILE * pFile ; pFile = fopen ( argv [ 1 ], \"rb\" ); long long x ; size_t read ; while ( ! feof ( pFile )) { read = fread ( & x , sizeof ( long long ), 1 , pFile ); ( void ) read ; if ( feof ( pFile )){ break ; // otherwise it duplicates the last entry } cout << x << endl ; } fclose ( pFile ); } } Improve sieving The following change was suggested by Niklas B. . Thanks! Take a look at the inner for loop. This one does the sieving, so it gets executed very often. In this loop, you have to calculate j i for checking the condition of the loop and again for setting it to false. You can get rid of one of those operations. Additionally, you don't have to start sieving at 2 p, but you can start at p*p as you already sieved out all multiples of the first, second, ..., current-1-th prime. #include <stdio.h> // fopen #include <iostream> // atoi #include <vector> using namespace std ; void sieveOfEratosthenes ( long long n ) { FILE * pFile ; pFile = fopen ( \"huge-prime-list.bin\" , \"wb\" ); vector < bool > primesEratosthenes ( n + 1 , true ); long long tmp = 2 ; fwrite ( & tmp , sizeof ( long long ), 1 , pFile ); for ( long long i = 3 ; i < n ; i += 2 ) { if ( primesEratosthenes [ i ]) { fwrite ( & i , sizeof ( long long ), 1 , pFile ); for ( long long j = i * i ; j <= n ; j += i ) { primesEratosthenes [ j ] = false ; } } } fclose ( pFile ); } int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { if ( argc != 2 ) { cout << \"You have to specify n\" << endl ; } else { long long n = ( long long ) atoi ( argv [ 1 ]); sieveOfEratosthenes ( n ); } return 0 ; } Execute: time ./generate-prime-list.out 1000000000 real 0m24.222s user 0m23.485s sys 0m0.436s primesieve Primesieve is a free software program and C++ library that generates prime numbers and prime k-tuplets (twin primes, prime triplets, ...) \\(< 2&#94;{64}\\) using a highly optimized implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.

Sieve of Atkin Arthur Oliver Lonsdale Atkin (July 31, 1925 – December 28, 2008) was a British mathematician who invented this sieve.

Please provide a working example (e.g. as a gist )","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Generating many prime numbers"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/solving-equations-of-upper-triangular-matrices/","text":"Suppose you have an equation like \\(R \\cdot x = b\\) with \\(R \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) and \\(x,b \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) . \\(b\\) and \\(R\\) are given and you want to solve for \\(x\\) . Example With \\(n=5\\) , the problem could look like this: $$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 & 1 & 8 & 2\\\\ 0 & 8 & 1 & 8 & 2\\\\ 0 & 0 & 8 & 4 & 5\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$$ This is only a shorthand for: \\begin{align} 2 \\cdot x_1 + 7 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 2 \\cdot x_5 &= 3\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 2 \\cdot x_5 &= 1\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot x_5 &= 4\\\\ 9 \\cdot x_4 + 0 \\cdot x_5 &= 1\\\\ 4 \\cdot x_5 &= 5 \\end{align} First step: Solve for $x_5$ First you see that \\(x_5 = \\frac{5}{4}\\) . So you divide \\(b\\) by the current row. Don't divide through 0. When you would have to divide by 0 and b is 0, this system has an infinite amount of solutions. When you would have to divide by 0 and b is not 0, then this system has no solution. Now you replace every occurrence of \\(x_5\\) in the system of equations above: \\begin{align} 2 \\cdot x_1 + 7 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} &= 3\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} &= 1\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + 5 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} &= 4\\\\ 9 \\cdot x_4 + 0 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} &= 1\\\\ 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} &= 5 \\end{align} Now you make the multiplications and remove the first trivial line. \\begin{align} 2 \\cdot x_1 + 7 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + \\frac{5}{2} &= 3\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + \\frac{5}{2} &= 1\\\\ 8 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 + \\frac{25}{4} &= 4\\\\ 9 \\cdot x_4 + 0 &= 1\\\\ \\end{align} Second step: update Get the constant factors to the right side of the equations: \\begin{align} 2 \\cdot x_1 + 7 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 &= \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 8 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 &= -\\frac{3}{2} \\\\ 8 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 &= -\\frac{9}{4}\\\\ 9 \\cdot x_4 &= 1\\\\ \\end{align} You're now in the same situation as in the first step. Next you will solve for \\(x_4\\) , then for \\(x_3, x_2\\) and finally for \\(x_1\\) . This is called \"back substitution\".

But if you simply remove line 5 to 16, you will get: [ 1 , 0 , -1, 0 , 1 ] because of integer arithmetic. When you convert the input to float before passing it to solveUpperTriangularMatrix , you will get [ 0 .8717447916666666, -0.25651041666666663, -0.3368055555555556, 0 .1111111111111111, 1 .25 ] which is almost the same as when we calculated with Fraction and converted to float afterwards: [ 0 .8717447916666666, -0.2565104166666667, -0.3368055555555556, 0 .1111111111111111, 1 .25 ] So: Using Fractions needs some computing time, but you will get better results. Time complexity I'll analyze the second algorithm. The conversion of our input data is obviously in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) . Let's only analyse the part after the conversion. Assume that there is exactly one solution and that line 15-21 take \\(c_1\\) operations and line 24 takes \\(c_2\\) operations. Then we would have a total of \\begin{align} \\text{Operations} &= \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left ( c_1 + \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{i-1} c_2 \\right )\\\\ &= \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n c_1 + \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{i-1} c_2\\\\ &= n \\cdot c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\left (\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\sum_{j=1}&#94;{i-1} 1 \\right )\\\\ &= n \\cdot c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\left (\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (i-1) \\right )\\\\ &= n \\cdot c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\left ((\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n i) - (\\sum_{i=1}&#94;n 1) \\right )\\\\ &= n \\cdot c_1 + c_2 \\cdot \\left (\\frac{n&#94;2+n}{2} - n \\right )\\\\ &= n \\cdot c_1 + (n&#94;2-n) \\cdot \\frac{c_2}{2}\\\\ \\end{align} So the algorithms time complexity is in \\(\\Theta(n&#94;2) \\subsetneq \\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) . Space complexity Please note that I take advantage of Pythons dynamic typing system. I think it's difficult to see space complexity in python programs. But when you make the same in C++, you will see that you will need space in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) when you do the conversion. Without the conversion, you're in \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) . I guess you might want to leave this choice to the user of your functions. When he wants better results, he should give the input as Fraction. When he wants to get results rather faster, he should give the input as float. Notes In this algorithm, we don't need anything below the diagonal.","tags":"Code","title":"Solving equations of upper triangular matrices"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/solving-equations-of-unipotent-lower-triangular-matrices/","text":"Suppose you have an equation like \\(L \\cdot x = b\\) with \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) and \\(x,b \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;n\\) . \\(b\\) and \\(L\\) are given and you want to solve for \\(x\\) . Example With \\(n=5\\) , the problem could look like this: \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 7 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 8 & 2 & 8 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 8 & 2 & 8 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\) This is only a shorthand for: \\begin{align} &1 \\cdot x_1 &= 3 \\\\ &2 \\cdot x_1 + 1 \\cdot x_2 &= 1\\\\ &7 \\cdot x_1 + 1 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 &= 4\\\\ &8 \\cdot x_1 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 8 \\cdot x_3 + 1 \\cdot x_4 &= 1\\\\ &1 \\cdot x_1 + 8 \\cdot x_2 + 2 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 1 \\cdot x_5 &= 5 \\end{align} This is easy to solve, isn't it? First step: Solve for \\(x_1\\) First you see that \\(x_1 = 3\\) . Now you replace every occurence of \\(x_1\\) in the system of equations above: \\begin{align} &1 \\cdot 3 &= 3 \\\\ &2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot x_2 &= 1\\\\ &7 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 &= 4\\\\ &8 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 8 \\cdot x_3 + 1 \\cdot x_4 &= 1\\\\ &1 \\cdot 3 + 8 \\cdot x_2 + 2 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 1 \\cdot x_5 &= 5 \\end{align} Now you make the multiplications and remove the first trivial line. \\begin{align} &6 + 1 \\cdot x_2 &= 1\\\\ &21 + 1 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 &= 4\\\\ &24 + 2 \\cdot x_2 + 8 \\cdot x_3 + 1 \\cdot x_4 &= 1\\\\ &3 + 8 \\cdot x_2 + 2 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 1 \\cdot x_5 &= 5 \\end{align} Second step: update Get the constant factors to the right side of the equations: \\begin{align} &1 \\cdot x_2 &= 1-6=-5\\\\ &1 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 &= 4-21=-17\\\\ &2 \\cdot x_2 + 8 \\cdot x_3 + 1 \\cdot x_4 &= 1-24=-23\\\\ &8 \\cdot x_2 + 2 \\cdot x_3 + 8 \\cdot x_4 + 1 \\cdot x_5 &= 5-3=2 \\end{align} You can now easily see that you're in the same situation as in the first step! Next you will solve for \\(x_2\\) , then for \\(x_3, x_4\\) and finally for \\(x_5\\) . This is the reason why solving such a system of equations is sometimes called \"forward substitution\". Python straightforward algorithm #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ): x = [ 0 ] * len ( b ) for step in range ( 0 , len ( b )): x [ step ] = b [ step ] for row in range ( 0 , len ( b )): b [ row ] = b [ row ] - L [ row ][ step ] * x [ step ] return x if __name__ == \"__main__\" : L = [[ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 2 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 7 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ], [ 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 ]] b = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] print ( solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b )) Pretty easy, isn't it? But can we even do better? Even better algorithm Yes, we can! Take a look at what's happening when row = 0 in line 9. We make a step that is not necessary. Also, we can take the space of b to store x! #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ): for step in range ( 0 , len ( b )): for row in range ( step + 1 , len ( b )): b [ row ] -= L [ row ][ step ] * b [ step ] if __name__ == \"__main__\" : L = [[ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 2 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 7 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ], [ 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 ]] b = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ) print ( b ) Now it looks super clean, doesn't it ☺ Keep in mind that you have to store b if you need the values after you've applied this algorithm. This is the reason why there here. This algorithm \"returns\" its value by manipulating b. Time complexity I'll analyze the second algorithm. Let's assume that line 7 takes \\(c\\) operations and \\(n\\) is the size of \\(L \\in \\mathbb{R}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) . Then we would have a total of \\begin{align} \\text{Operations} &= \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left ( \\sum_{j=i+1}&#94;n c \\right )\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n \\left ( \\sum_{j=i+1}&#94;n 1 \\right )\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n (n - i)\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\left ( \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n n - \\sum_{i=1}&#94;n i \\right )\\\\ &= c \\cdot \\left ( n&#94;2 - \\frac{n&#94;2+n}{2} \\right )\\\\ &= \\frac{c}{2} (n&#94;2 - n) \\end{align} So the algorithms time complexity is in \\(\\Theta(n&#94;2) \\subsetneq \\mathcal{O}(n&#94;2)\\) . Space complexity Well, thats simple: \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) ! I do ignore the size of the input. So \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) means: For variable sized input data I do need a constant amount of additional space. More improvements In the last algorithm I've presented you can see that we actually don't check the values on or above of the diagonal. This means, the following two function calls do give the same b: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ): for step in range ( 0 , len ( b )): for row in range ( step + 1 , len ( b )): b [ row ] -= L [ row ][ step ] * b [ step ] return L if __name__ == \"__main__\" : L = [[ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 2 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ], [ 7 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 ], [ 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 8 , 2 , 8 , 1 ]] b = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ) print ( b ) L = [[ 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ], [ 2 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ], [ 7 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 ], [ 8 , 2 , 8 , 2 , 3 ], [ 1 , 8 , 2 , 8 , 4 ]] b = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] solveLowerUnitriangularMatrix ( L , b ) print ( b ) So, theoretically, we could store some other information on and above of the diagonal. We also don't change L. Keep this in mind, this might be important in later articles.","tags":"Code","title":"Solving equations of lower unitriangular matrices"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-interactive-example/","text":"When the circle has exactly the same number of blue / green dots in it, it will be green.

And I also want to analyze some basic characteristics of the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequences \\((c&#94;n_i)\\) of a number \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}_{> 0}\\) is defined like this: \\(f:\\mathbb{N}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_{> 0}\\;\\;\\;\\;f(n) := \\begin{cases} \\frac{n}{2} & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even}\\\\ 3 \\cdot n + 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases} \\) So the sequence \\((c&#94;n_{i})\\) is defined as: \\(c&#94;n_{i} := \\begin{cases} n & \\text{if } i = 0\\\\ f(c&#94;n_i) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\) You can define a directed graph \\(G=(V, E)\\) like this: \\(V = \\mathbb{N}_{>0}, \\;\\;\\; E = \\{(n, f(n)) | n \\in V\\}\\) I will call this the Collatz graph .

This is astonishing, as it was proposed in 1937 and I think it is very easy to understand. We also don't know if the Collatz graph is connected. When it is not connected, it could be that one sequence \\((c&#94;n_i)\\) goes to infinity or that there is another circle ( \\(4,2,1,4\\) is a circle in the Collatz graph).

I've been interested in the question how long Collatz sequences are. Of course, they will be longer when \\(n\\) is bigger. But how does the choice of \\(n\\) influence the number of steps it takes until you reach \\(c&#94;n_i = 1\\) ? I've tested all Collatz sequences with \\(n \\leq 10,000,000\\) . This is the result: Collatz sequence steps For every hexagon, you check how many datapoints \\((n,steps)\\) you have there. This leads to the count. As you can see, step numbers from 50-120 are very common, the rest is very uncommon. The number of steps increases very slow.

The idea is to calculate at first the maximum number of steps you need and then go from your target destination to the origin. How many steps do you need? In the \\(i\\) round, you will make \\(i\\) steps. You need at least \\(x+y\\) steps to get from \\((0|0)\\) to \\((x|y)\\) .

But here is a Java solution .","tags":"Code","title":"Google Code Jam – Round 1C 2013"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/how-do-hash-functions-work/","text":"Everybody who has written a noticeable amount of Java code should know the method hashCode () . But most beginners have difficulties to understand the significance of this little method. The following article gives you one small example with some impressions how much hash functions influence execution time. Connect four Connect Four [...] is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. Source: Wikipedia It looks like this: Connect Four Source: commons.wikimedia.org The task Imagine you would like to find a good strategy where to drop your disk. A simple brute-force method is to create a so called game tree . This means you go through each possibility at each situation that could occur in the game for both players. This approach has generally two problems: You have to know how to go through each situation. For connect four it is easy. Both players place their disks in turns and in every turn the current player has at most 7 possibilities. But it is impossible for games like Calvinball or Mao . The game tree might be HUGE. In this case, you can have \\(4,531,985,219,092 \\approx 4.5 \\cdot 10&#94;{12}\\) game situations ( source ). Even if you would need only one bit for each situation, it would require 566.5 GB! Anyway, lets say we want to store many unique game situations. Unique means, even if you have hundreds of possible paths to get to a given game situations, you will store this game situation only once. Implementation First of all, I would like to mention that you can skip the source code . I've only included it to make it easier to understand what I'm talking about. Lets say our game situation looks like this: struct gamesituation { /** How does the board currently look like? */ char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]; /** * What are the next game situations that I can reach from this * board? * The next[i] means that the player dropped the disc at column i */ int next [ 7 ]; /* I could use a bitfield for this ... but it would make access * much more inconvenient. */ unsigned char isEmpty ; // Is this gamesitatution already filled? unsigned char isFinished ; // Is this game finished? unsigned char stalemate ; // Was this game a stalemate? unsigned char winRed ; // Did red win? unsigned char winBlack ; // Did black win? }; You need a check if one player won: /* * Check if player has won by placing a disc on (x,y). * with direction (xDir, yDir) * @return 1 iff RED won, -1 iff BLACK won and 0 if nobody won */ signed char hasPlayerWon ( char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ], int x , int y , char xDir , char yDir ) { char color = board [ x ][ y ]; int tokensInRow = getTokensInRow ( board , color , x , y , xDir , yDir ) + getTokensInRow ( board , color , x , y , - xDir , - yDir ) - 1 ; if ( tokensInRow >= WINNING_NR ) { if ( color == RED ) { return 1 ; } else if ( color == BLACK ) { return - 1 ; } else { perror ( \"this color doesn't / shouldn't exist \\n \" ); exit ( 1 ); } } return 0 ; } /* * A new disc has been dropped. Check if this disc means that * somebody won. * @return 1 iff RED won, -1 iff BLACK won, otherwise NOT_FINISHED */ int isBoardFinished ( char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ], int x , int y ) { signed char status ; // check left-right status = hasPlayerWon ( board , x , y , 1 , 0 ); if ( status != 0 ) { return status ; } // top-down status = hasPlayerWon ( board , x , y , 0 , 1 ); if ( status != 0 ) { return status ; } // down-left to top-right status = hasPlayerWon ( board , x , y , 1 , 1 ); if ( status != 0 ) { return status ; } // top-left to down-right status = hasPlayerWon ( board , x , y , - 1 , 1 ); if ( status != 0 ) { return status ; } return NOT_FINISHED ; } If you need an explanation for this, you should read this article . And you need a function that can mirror boards (to get rid of identical, but mirrored situations) and one that can compare boards: char isSameBoard ( char a [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ], char b [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]) { for ( int x = 0 ; x < BOARD_WIDTH ; x ++ ) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < BOARD_HEIGHT ; y ++ ) { if ( a [ x ][ y ] != b [ x ][ y ]) { return FALSE ; } } } return TRUE ; } void mirrorBoard ( char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ], char newBoard [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]) { for ( int x = 0 ; x < BOARD_WIDTH ; x ++ ) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < BOARD_HEIGHT ; y ++ ) { newBoard [ BOARD_WIDTH - x - 1 ][ y ] = board [ x ][ y ]; } } } You need a function that makes all possible moves for the players: /* * Make all possible turns that the player can make in this * game situation. */ void makeTurns ( char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ], char currentPlayer , unsigned int lastId , int recursion ) { unsigned int insertID ; int outcome ; for ( int column = 0 ; column < BOARD_WIDTH ; column ++ ) { // add to column int height = BOARD_HEIGHT - 1 ; // the disc falls down while ( height >= 0 && board [ column ][ height ] == EMPTY ) { height -- ; } height ++ ; // this colum is full if ( height == 6 ) { continue ; } // place disc board [ column ][ height ] = currentPlayer ; if ( didBoardAlreadyOccur ( board )) { // I've already got to this situation insertID = getBoardIndex ( board ); savePreviousID ( insertID , lastId , column ); } else { char mirrored [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]; mirrorBoard ( board , mirrored ); if ( didBoardAlreadyOccur ( mirrored )) { // I've already got this situation, but mirrored // so take care of symmetry at this point mirroredCounter ++ ; insertID = getBoardIndex ( mirrored ); savePreviousID ( insertID , lastId , column ); } else { registeredSituations ++ ; if ( registeredSituations == MAXIMUM_SITUATIONS ) { giveCurrentInformation (); exit ( MAXIMUM_SITUATIONS_REACHED_EXIT_STATUS ); } if ( REGISTERED_MOD > 0 && registeredSituations % REGISTERED_MOD == 0 ) { giveCurrentInformation (); } outcome = isBoardFinished ( board , column , height ); if ( ABS ( outcome ) <= 1 ) { // the game is finished insertID = getNewIndex ( board ); storeToDatabase ( insertID , board , TRUE , outcome ); savePreviousID ( insertID , lastId , column ); } else { // Switch players if ( currentPlayer == RED ) { currentPlayer = BLACK ; } else { currentPlayer = RED ; } insertID = getNewIndex ( board ); setBoard ( insertID , board ); savePreviousID ( insertID , lastId , column ); char copy [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]; for ( int x = 0 ; x < BOARD_WIDTH ; x ++ ) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < BOARD_HEIGHT ; y ++ ) { copy [ x ][ y ] = board [ x ][ y ]; } } makeTurns ( copy , currentPlayer , insertID , recursion + 1 ); } } } } } How is this realated to hash functions? You might have noticed a few functions that I didn't explain by now: didBoardAlreadyOccur(board) : Checks if a given board is stored in database. getBoardIndex(board) : This is a function that takes a board and gives a non-negative integer which is characteristic for the given board. savePreviousID(insertID, lastId, column) : store insertID as a possible next situation for lastId in database setBoard(insertID, board) : Insert board into database at position insertID How would you implement didBoardAlreadyOccur(board) ? This function (or insertID) will be the slowest part of the code and will be called VERY often. So it needs to be as fast as possible. A hash function Most of the time you can create hash functions by mapping values to integers. In my case, I mapped the board - which is a two-dimensional char array - to one integer by thinking of it as a very long number. I think of a red disc as the digit 1, a black disc as the digit 2 and an empty field as 0: unsigned int charToInt ( char x ) { if ( x == RED ) { return 1 ; } else if ( x == BLACK ) { return 2 ; } else { return 0 ; } } When you want to get the board number, you can get it like this: Empty=0, red=1, yellow=2 The board number is 00000000000000000210000211210112212 For most game situations, this number will be much too big to store it in an integer. Also, we would like to get an index for our array so that we know where to store this board. The simplest solution to this problem is to calculate NUMBER % ARRAY_SIZE : unsigned int getFirstIndex ( char board [ BOARD_WIDTH ][ BOARD_HEIGHT ]) { unsigned int index = 0 ; for ( int x = 0 ; x < BOARD_WIDTH ; x ++ ) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < BOARD_HEIGHT ; y ++ ) { index += charToInt ( board [ x ][ y ]) * myPow ( 3 , (( x + y * BOARD_WIDTH ) % HASH_MODULO )); } } index = index % MAXIMUM_SITUATIONS ; return index ; } The function getFirstIndex maps an char Array with BOARD_WIDTH * BOARD_HEIGHT = 7 * 6 = 42 elements to an integer interval [0, MAXIMUM_SITUATIONS] = [0, 20000000]. Although I only use three values for the char array, that is \\(3&#94;{42} = 109418989131512359209 \\approx 1.09 \\cdot 10&#94;{20}\\) . There are many game situation numbers that can never occur (e.g. two more red than black dists), but we still map a significantly larger space to [0,20000000]. You can't change that. You can probably find (much) better mappings, but as we know that there are \\(4.5 \\cdot 10&#94;{12}\\) game situations, you will always have the problem that your codomain is much smaller than the domain of your hash function. That's a fundamental problem of hash functions. This means, you will have two board situations that map to the same hash number. This is called a \"hash collision\". When you use the hash number directly as an index for your board, you will have to deal with hash collisions. Some solutions are: Ignoring the problem: That's boring and not always possible (but simple). Linear probing Quadratic probing Linear probing The idea of linear probing is very simple: Inserting a new item: You look at the index \\(i\\) that your hash function gave you. If this index is already full, you look at \\(i+1\\) When you took a look at all slots of your array, you can't insert the new item. Searching for an already inserted item: You look at the index \\(i\\) that your hash function gave you. If \\(i\\) is empty, you're ready. The item was not inserted. If \\(i\\) is not the item you've searched for, you have to look at \\(i+1\\) . Keep looking at the next item until you find your searched item, you've looked at all items or you find an empty slot. Deleting is complicated. You have to look at all items after the deleted one, remove them from your array and insert them again. That's not good. The problem of linear probing is clustering . When you have some hash values that are close together, you might get hash collisions faster. When you've got your first collisions, you resolve them by inserting the value close to the value where you originally wanted to save it. So you get one big cluster quite fast. When you want to insert an element in the cluster, you first have to search the end of the cluster. That's bad for performance. An advantage of linear probing compared to quadratic probing is that you might get a better performance due to cache effects. Quadratic probing The idea of quadratic probing is the same as for linear probing, but you try to fix the clustering-problem by using a clever way to search for a free spot: \\(h_i(x) = \\left(h(x) + (-1)&#94;{i+1} \\cdot \\left\\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\right\\rceil&#94;2\\right) \\bmod~m\\) where \\(h\\) is your hash function and \\(i\\) is your i-th try to find a free spot while you have \\(m\\) spots in total. This one also suffers from clustering, but it's not as bad as with linear clustering. Double hashing This solution could be the best one, but also the hardest one to implement correctly. You could find a free spot by using a second hash function \\(h'\\) like this: \\(h_i(x) = (h(x)+h'(x)\\cdot i) ~ \\bmod ~ m\\) BUT you have to make sure that \\(Pr[h(x)=h(y) \\land h'(x)=h'(y)] = \\frac{1}{m&#94;2}\\) Performance You can use linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing in my example and measure how many game situations get stored. The more game situations you can store in the same amount of time, the better: Linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing for connect four You can see that linear probing performs much worse than quadratic probing and double hashing. When you compare quadratic probing with double hashing, there seems not to be a big difference. But note that my second hash function is almost the same as the first one. You could probably choose a better second hash function and get better results (suggestions are welcome). Why are hash functions important? Hash functions help you to map a big amount of data to a small space. They are important, because they are a relevant part of many datastructures. The better they are, the faster will operations on those datastructures work. Better means: Faster to compute or less collisions. Some datastructures like this are: HashMap and HashTable (→ difference ) HashSet Final notes Another resolution for hash collisions is creating a linked list. This means you will not suffer from clustering and you can insert in \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) . But searching for an element is still in \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) , where \\(n\\) is the number of elements that were already inserted.

If your target coordinates are $(x,y)$ , you have the same output as for $(-x,y)$ , as everything is symmetric. You have to get a basis for your diamonds pyramid. I've colored the basis in yellow in the images below. When your target is above the ground, you can let the diamond slide down to calculate the size of the basis. You have to get those yellow diamonds first, before you can get the orange one. Let Diamonds slide down Note that you don't have to calculate a probabilty for the yellow pyramids. You get those with probability of 1. What I've forgot: You should also catch the case that you can fill up the next bigger pyramid. If this is possible, you can guarantee that you will reach your target \\((x,y)\\) . The rest is simple math. You have \\(rest\\) diamonds left after you've build the base (yellow). Then you need \\(y+1\\) diamonds slide to the right side.

Homomorphie ist folgende (unerwünschte) Eigenschaft: \\begin{align} Enc(pk, m_1) \\cdot Enc(pk, m_2) &= m_1&#94;e \\cdot m_2&#94;e\\\\ &= (m_1 \\cdot m_2)&#94;e \\\\ &= Enc(pk, m_1 \\cdot m_2) \\end{align} Diese Eigenschaft ist z.B. in folgendem Szenario problematisch: Angenommen bei einer Auktion werden die gebotenen Geldbeträge verschlüsselt. Dann kann ein Angreifer das Chiffrat (gültig) verändern. So kann er den Geldbetrag ohne Probleme verdoppeln. Was sind HMACs ? Spezielle symmetrische Signaturen, die wie folgt aufgebaut sind: $Sig(K, M) = H(K \\oplus opad, H(K \\oplus ipad, M))$ Wie funktioniert ElGamal ? Wähle eine zyklische Gruppe $\\mathbb{G} = \\langle g \\rangle$. $pk = (\\mathbb{G}, g, g&#94;x)$, $sk=(\\mathbb{G}, g, x)$, wobei $x$ zufällig gewählt wird. Verschlüsselung einer Nachricht $m$: $Enc(pk, m) = (g&#94;y, g&#94;{xy} \\cdot m)$ mit zufälligem $y$ → Verschlüsselung ist zufällig! Verschlüsselung eines Ciphertextes $c$: $Dec(sk, (Y, Z)) = \\frac{Z}{Y&#94;x} = \\frac{g&#94;{xy} \\cdot m}{(g&#94;{y})&#94;x} = m$ Wie funktioniert das Kerberos-Schlüsselaustauschprotokoll? Alice schreibt dem KC , dass Alice und Bob gerne einen Schlüsselaustausch vornehmen wollen. Das KC schickt Alice ihren Schlüssel $K_A$, den sie für die Kommunikation mit Bob verwenden kann. Zusätzlich wird ein Zeitstempel $T_{KC}$, eine Gültigkeitsdauer $L$ sowie ein frischer Schlüssel $K$ übertragen. TODO!!!! Ein gutes YouTube-Video gibts auch. Warum kann es schlecht für die Sicherheit sein, wenn man komprimiert? Annahme: Ein Angreifer kann zu dem Geheimtext, der komprimiert wird, etwas vor der Kompression hinzufügen. Wenn der Ciphertext deutlich weniger wächst als er an Text hinzugefügt hat, kann er vermuten, dass er den Text erraten hat. (→ CRIME-Angriff) Was ist damit gemeint, dass das One-Time-Pad-Chiffre verwundbar ist? Ein Angreifer kann die Klartextnachricht ändern. Wenn er weiß (oder zumindest ahnt) was der Klartext ist, kann er dafür sorgen, dass ein Klartext gleicher Länge seiner Wahl bei der Entschlüsselung herauskommt. Nennen Sie Verfahren, die IND-CPA-sicher sind. Eine Blockciffre im CBC-Modus Nennen Sie Verfahren, die EUF-CMA-sicher sind. Sei PRF: $\\{0,1\\}&#94;k \\times \\{0,1\\}&#94;k \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}&#94;k$ eine PRF und $H:\\{0,1\\}&#94;* \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}&#94;k$ eine kollisionsresistente Hashfunktion. Dann ist der durch $Sig(K, M) = PRF(K, H(M))$ gegebene MAC EUF-CMA-sicher.

Warum das so ist, versuche ich nun zu erläutern. Einwegfunktionen und $\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}$ Sei $f:X \\rightarrow Y$ eine Funktion. $f$ heißt eine Einwegfunktion, genau dann wenn für alle $x \\in X$ gilt: $y := f(x)$ kann in Polynomialzeit berechnet werden Für die Berechnung eines Urbildes $x$ aus $y$ existiert kein randomisierter Algorithmus, der in Polynomialzeit läuft. Es gilt: Wenn eine Einwegfunktion \\(f\\) existiert, dann gilt \\(\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}\\) . Warum? Nun, angenommen es gibt eine Einwegfunktion \\(f\\) . Dann sei die formale Sprache \\(L_f\\) definiert durch: \\(L_f := \\{(\\bar x, y) | \\exists x: \\bar x \\text{ ist Präfix von } x \\text{ und } y = f(x)\\}\\) Es gilt: \\(L_f \\notin \\mathcal{P}\\) , da für ein gegebenes \\(y\\) das zugehörige \\(x\\) in polynomialzeit bestimmt werden könnte (wie will man sonst prüfen, ob \\(\\bar x\\) ein Präfix von \\(x\\) ist?) Falls jemanden diese Begründung nicht ausreicht ist hier noch ein Beweis von Prof. Hofheinz (Danke!) Beh.: \\(L_f \\notin \\mathcal{P}\\) Bew.: durch Widerspruch Annahme.: \\(L_f \\in P\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Es existiert ein Polyzeit-Algorithmus \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) für \\(L_f\\) , der bei Eingabe \\((\\bar x, y)\\) entscheidet, ob ein \\(x\\) mit \\(f(x)=y\\) und Präfix \\(\\bar x\\) existiert oder nicht. Dann können wir einen Algorithmus \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) aus \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) bauen, der \\(f\\) invertiert. Gegeben \\(y\\) verfährt \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) wie folgt: \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) ruft \\(\\mathcal{A}(0,y)\\) auf und erfährt so, ob ein Urbild \\(x\\) von \\(y\\) mit Anfangsbit \\(0\\) existiert. Wenn ja, ruft \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) den Algorithmus \\(\\mathcal{A}(00,y)\\) auf, wenn nein ruft \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) den Algorithmus \\(\\mathcal{A}(10,y)\\) auf usw. So wird ein Urbild \\(x\\) bitweise bestimmt. Ein solches \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) findet also effizient Urbilder, im Widerspruch zur Einwegannahme über \\(f \\blacksquare\\) Aber: Wenn das \\(x\\) gegeben ist, dann ist es einfach zu zeigen, dass \\(y= f(x)\\) gilt und damit auch, ob \\(\\bar x\\) ein Präfix von \\(x\\) ist. Damit ist \\(L_f \\in \\mathcal{NP}\\) . Damit gilt: \\(L_f \\in \\mathcal{NP} \\setminus \\mathcal{P}\\) . Wenn aber \\(\\mathcal{NP} \\setminus \\mathcal{P} \\neq \\emptyset\\) , dann gilt insbesondere \\(\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}\\) . An dieser Stelle sollte man also einsehen, dass eine Einwegfunktion nach obiger Definition nur existieren kann, wenn \\(\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}\\) gilt. Semantische Sicherheit Wikipedia gibt folgende Beschreibung von semantischer Sicherheit: Ein Verschlüsselungsverfahren ist semantisch sicher, wenn jeder Angreifer jede Information, die er aus einem Chiffrat über die Nachricht ableiten kann, bereits dann ableiten kann, wenn er nur die Länge des Chiffrats kennt. Ein Chiffrat verrät also nichts über eine Nachricht als ihre Länge. Herr Prof. Hofheinz hat folgende informelle Definition von Semantischer Sicherheit in der Vorlesung gegeben: Ein symmetrisches Verschlüsselungsverfahren ist semantisch sicher, wenn es für jede $M$ -Verteilung, jede Funktion $f$ und jeden PPT-Algorithmus $\\mathcal{A}$ einen PPT-Algorithmus $\\mathcal{B}$ gibt, so dass $Pr \\left [\\mathcal{A}&#94;{\\text{Enc}(K, \\cdot)}(\\text{Enc}(K, M)) = f(M) \\right ] - Pr [\\mathcal{B}(\\varepsilon) = f(M)]$ vernachlässigbar (als Funktion im Sicherheitsparameter $K$ ) ist. Hier ist \\(M\\) eine Nachricht (Message), \\(\\text{Enc(K, M)}\\) die Verschlüsselung einer konkreten Nachricht \\(M\\) mit dem Schlüssel \\(K\\) , \\(\\varepsilon\\) eine triviale Information (ich glaube das ist z.B. die Länge des Ciphertextes) und \\(f\\) extrahiert beliebige Informationen aus dem Plaintext Die erste Wahrscheinlichkeit bezeichnet die Möglichkeit, aus dem Ciphertext Informationen der Art \\(f\\) über den Plaintext \\(M\\) zu erhalten. Die zweite Wahrscheinlichkeit bezeichnet die Möglichkeit „aus dem Nichts\" Informationen über eine Nachricht zu erhalten. Damit will man triviale Informationen eliminieren. Insgesamt gibt es also die Wahrscheinlichkeit an, nicht-triviale Informationen aus einer Verschlüsselten Nachricht zu erhalten. Mit effizient ist vermutlich in Polynomialzeit gemeint. Wenn es nun mehrfach benutzbare semantisch sichere Verfahren gibt, dann kann man dieses Verfahren als Einwegfunktion nutzen. Wenn eine Einwegfunktion existiert, gilt \\(\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}\\) . Also folgt: Wenn es nun mehrfach benutzbare semantisch sichere Verfahren existieren, gilt \\(\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{NP}\\) . Dies ist aber eines der Millennium-Probleme und noch nicht geklärt.","tags":"German posts","title":"Semantische Sicherheit"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/google-code-jam-round-1a-2013/","text":"Problem A ( Bullseye ): Small Set: 5856/6195 users (95%) Large Set: 1806/4795 users (38%) Problem B ( Manage your Energy ): Small Set: 2323/3789 users (61%) Large Set: 456/1133 users (40%) Problem C ( Good Luck ): Small Set: 1366/1774 users (77%) Large Set: 31/605 users (5%) More information might soon be on go-hero.net .

Gedanken zu den Klausurhinweisen Eine schöne Skriptsammlung Aufbau der Klausur Eine Aufgabe, wo man das Legendre-Symbol ausrechnen muss Eine Aufgabe, wo man mit dem Satz von Lagrange wichtig ist Eine Aufgabe zu Normalteilern / Sylowgruppen Der Kleine Satz von Fermat / Homomorphiesatz Übungsbetrieb Wo sind die Übungsblätter: online Abgabeform: handschriftlich Abgabe: Donnerstags, Kästen in Gebäude 1C Rücknahme: in den Tutorien Turnus: wöchentlich Übungsschein verpflichtend: Nein Bonus durch Übungsschein: Nein Termine und Klausurablauf Datum : 05.09.2013, 11:00 Uhr - 13:00 Uhr Zeit : 2 Stunden Ort : Hörsaal am Fasanengarten Punkte : 60 Punkte Bestehensgrenze : 22 Punkte Übungsschein : Gibt es (sogar benotet) Bonuspunkte : Nein Nicht vergessen Studentenausweis Kugelschreiber Ergebnisse Seit dem 12.09.2013 draußen: an den Informationstafeln bei den Räumen 4A-21.1 und 4B-01","tags":"German posts","title":"E.i.d.

Ein DBMS ist eine Software zur Datenverwaltung. Die eigentlichen Daten sind in der Datenbank. Ein DBS ist eine DBMS und eine Datenbank. Ein DBMS kann mehrere Datenbanken verwalten. Sei $H = r_1[y] w_1[x] r_3[x] w_1[z] r_2[z] w_3[y] r_2[x] w_2[y] c1 r_3[y] c_3 w_2[z] c_2$. Welche Transaktionen sind in dieser History? Ein Eintrag $r_i[x]$ bedeutet, dass die Transaktion $i$ die Ressource $x$ liest. Ein Eintrag $w_i[x]$ bedeutet, dass die Transaktion $i$ die Ressource $x$ schreibt. $c_i$ bedeutet, dass die $i$-te Transaktion commitet wird Es gibt also die Transaktion $T_1, T_2 \\text{ und } T_3$ mit $T_1 = r_1[y] w_1[x] c_1$ Material Folien Vorlesungswebsite Mein Anki-Deck (digitale Karteikarten) Mitschrieb-Wiki In der Fachschaft gibt es folgende Altklausuren: 25.

Antwort von Herrn Keller: Bei Anfragen, die nur eine Anzahl in der Projektionsliste erwarten, können sie mit einer Query SELECT FROM das korrekte Ergebnistupel durch ausprobieren herausbekommen. Im Portal wird das zunächst als \"korrekt\" bewertet, allerdings werden wir das im Nachhinein filtern.

Insbesondere erkläre ich nicht wie man aus dem KV-Diagramm der Größe 16 eines der Größe 32 bekomt und was die Beschriftung bedeutet. KV-Diagramme sind für die TI-Klausur am KIT bei Herrn Prof. Dr. Asfour sehr wichtig. Im folgenden sind die wichtigsten Eigenschaften, die so explizit leider nicht in der Vorlesung genannt wurden. Konstruktion aus Schaltfunktion Gegeben sei folgende vollständig definierte Schaltfunktion: \\(f(w,x,y,z) := (w \\lor \\bar y) (\\bar w \\lor x \\lor y) (\\bar w \\lor \\bar x \\lor z)\\) Nun kann man eine Funktionstabelle aufstellen: Dabei schreibt man sich erst das Gerüst hin, also eine Titelzeile mit den vier Variablen \\(w,x,y,z\\) und \\(2&#94;4 = 16\\) Zeilen für die verschiedenen Funktionswerte. Wir brauchen jeweils eine Spalte für die vier Variablen, eine für den Funktionswert \\(f(w,x,y,z)\\) und am besten noch eine mit der Nummer. Nun zählen wir für die vier Variablen binär hoch. Dabei einsprechen die konkatenierten Ziffern der Variablen der Spalte „Nummer\". Ich fine es am einfachsten, dies Spaltenweise zu schreiben. Also 8 Nullen, 8 Einsen für \\(w\\) . Dann 4 Nullen, 4 Einsen, 4 Nullen, 4 Einsen für \\(x\\) usw. Als letztes schauen wir uns die drei geklammerten Terme von oben an und schauen, wann diese jeweils Null sind. In die entsprechenden Zeilen der Tabelle tragen wir eine Null ein. In alle Übrigen kommt eine Eins. Nr $w$ $x$ $y$ $z$ $f(w,x,y,z)$ 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 0 4 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 1 0 1 1 6 0 1 1 0 0 7 0 1 1 1 0 8 1 0 0 0 0 9 1 0 0 1 0 10 1 0 1 0 1 11 1 0 1 1 1 12 1 1 0 0 0 13 1 1 0 1 1 14 1 1 1 0 0 15 1 1 1 1 1 Will man diese Tabelle in ein KV-Diagramm übernehmen, muss man nur die Spalte \\(f(w,x,y,z)\\) in der richtigen Reihenfolge in die Tabelle füllen. Das macht man, indem man immer bei einem Eckpunkt beginnt und dann eine Z-Form durchgeht: KV-Speed-Zeichnen Am Ende sieht es so aus: Prim- und Kernprimimplikaten Sei \\(g(w,x,y,z)\\) eine Schaltfunktion. \\(g\\) ist ein Implikant von \\(f:\\Leftrightarrow \\forall_{(w,x,y,z) \\in \\{0,1\\}&#94;4}: g(w,x,y,z) \\Rightarrow f(w,x,y,z)\\) . Ist \\(g\\) ist ein Implikant von \\(f\\) , so ist \\(f\\) ein Implikat von \\(g\\) . Das kann man nun sehr schön mit dem KV-Diagramm verknüpfen. Wenn man die beiden Funktionen \\(f\\) und \\(g\\) in das KV-Diagramm einzeichnet, muss \\(f\\) überall dort eine 1 haben, wo \\(g\\) eine 1 hat. Was hat es nun mit Primimplikanten auf sich? Wenn man diese Kästchen um 1-Blöcke macht, dann müssen sie jeweils insgesamt genau \\(2&#94;k, k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) Einsen umfassen und dürfen an den Rändern fortgesetz werden (siehe der grüne um 5 und 13). Wenn so ein Block ein Primimplikant ist, darf es keinen größeren Eins-Block geben. Beispiel: KV-Diagramm - Beispiel mit Primimplikanten Das Rosa-Kästchen ist ein Implikant. Es ist jedoch kein Primimplikant, da das blaue Kästchen größer ist. Bis auf das rosa Kästchen und das braune Kästchen sind alle eingezeichenten Kästchen Primimplikanten sein. Es gibt keine weiteren Primimplikanten in dieser Funktion. Nun ist ein Primimplikant ein Kernprimimplikant, wenn er eine 1 überdeckt, die von keinem anderen Primimplikanten überdeckt wird. Das gilt für alle Primimplikanten außer den hellgrünen und den braunen Kästchen. Nochmals für das Beispiel: Primimplikanten sind: (0,1,5,4) // ganz oben, ist auch Kernprimimplikant (10,11) // 3. Zeile, ist auch Kernprimimplikant (11,15) // 3. Zeile, ist kein Kernprimimplikant (15,13) // 3. Spalte, ist kein Kernprimimplikant (13,5) // 3. Spalte, ist kein Kernprimimplikant Primimplikate sind: (2,3,7,6) // 2. Zeile, ist auch Kernprimimplikat (6,14) // 4. Spalte, ist kein Kernprimimplikat (14,12) //4. Spalte, ist kein Kernprimimplikat (8,9) // 4. Zeile, ist auch Kernprimimplikat (8, 12) // 4. Zeile, ist kein Kernprimimplikat Hasards Wie sieht man einen Hasard im KV-Diagramm? Man sucht sich eine Anfangsbelegung und eine Endbelegung. Wenn sich dazwischen \\(n\\) Variablen ändern, gibt es \\(n!\\) Pfade im KV-Diagram. Ist einer dieser Pfade nicht monoton, so ist dieser Übergang Hasardbehaftet. Nun kann man sich entweder die Funktion selbst im KV-Diagramm anschauen, oder die einzelnen Variablen mit dem Todzeitmodell aufsplitten. Untersucht man ersteres, kann man Funktionshasards finden, bei letzterem Strukturhasards. Nun kann man jeden Hasard noch aufteilen, je nach dem was der Wert der Funktion mit der Anfangsbelegung A bzw. der Wert der Funktion bei der Endbelegung B ist: \\(f(A) = 0 \\land f(B) = 0 \\Rightarrow\\) Statischer 0-Hasard \\(f(A) = 0 \\land f(B) = 1 \\Rightarrow\\) Dynamischer 01-Hasard \\(f(A) = 1 \\land f(B) = 0 \\Rightarrow\\) Dynamischer 10-Hasard \\(f(A) = 1 \\land f(B) = 1 \\Rightarrow\\) Statischer 1-Hasard Beispiel Hier ist ein Beispiel für einen dynamischen 1-0-Hasard: Beispiel eines dynamischen 1-0-Hasards Fallstricke Bei dem Suchen nach Eins- oder Nullblöcken darf man an den Spiegelachsen springen: KV Diagramm: Fallstrick 1 Quelle: Klausur vom SS 2010 (KIT) KV Diagramm: Fallstrick 2 Quelle: Klausur vom SS 2010 (KIT)","tags":"German posts","title":"KV-Diagramme"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/what-does-volatile-mean/","text":"You might have read the variable modifier volatile in C, C++ or in Java. But do you know what it means? C Programming Language The C Programming language by Kerninghan and Ritchie (second edition) contains this keyword only 13 times. Here are the most important ones: [...] declaring it volatile announces that it has special properties relevant to optimization. Neither qualifier affects the range of values or arithmetic properties of the object. Qualifiers are discussed in Par.A.8.2. Page 158 The purpose of volatile is to force an implementation to suppress optimization that could otherwise occur. For example, for a machine with memory-mapped input/output, a pointer to a device register might be declared as a pointer to volatile, in order to prevent the compiler from removing apparently redundant references through the pointer. Except that it should diagnose explicit attempts to change const objects, a compiler may ignore these qualifiers. Page 172 Java Java Language Specification actually covers this quite good: The Java programming language allows threads to access shared variables (§17.1). As a rule, to ensure that shared variables are consistently and reliably updated, a thread should ensure that it has exclusive use of such variables by obtaining a lock that, conventionally, enforces mutual exclusion for those shared variables. The Java programming language provides a second mechanism, volatile fields, that is more convenient than locking for some purposes. A field may be declared volatile, in which case the Java Memory Model ensures that all threads see a consistent value for the variable (§17.4). Ok, so in Java it is important for multithreading. The example 8.3.1.4-1 of the JLS 7.0 is also very interesting. A write to a volatile field (§8.3.1.4) happens-before every subsequent read of that field. For the purposes of the Java programming language memory model, a single write to a non-volatile long or double value is treated as two separate writes: one to each 32-bit half. This can result in a situation where a thread sees the first 32 bits of a 64-bit value from one write, and the second 32 bits from another write. Writes and reads of volatile long and double values are always atomic. When do you need it volatile? I'm not sure if it is correct what I write here. It makes sense, but please leave a note in comments when I'm wrong. Thermometer Imagine you want to build your own thermometer. So you have to access hardware. Now you only want to print the temperature periodically. Something like this: #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> int getTemperature () { // accessing the hardware device register happens here return 42 ; } int main () { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 60 ; i ++ ) { int temperature = getTemperature (); printf ( \"Temperature: %i &deg;C \\n \" , temperature ); sleep ( 2 ); } return 0 ; } Now, as you always access the same register and you don't change it, the CPU could cache the result. That would be bad, because another source (the hardware) changes the value. So you don't want to cache it. This is - if I understand it correctly - what volatile is good for. It makes sure that you really access memory and not some registers, because it got optimized or cached. I / O Imagine you write an application that want to transfer data from a disk to another disk. You might have one producer and one consumer. The producer tries to get data from the disk. Lets say the disk has a buffer and a register that indicates how many blocks are in the buffer. So your producer might poll at some point: int register = 0; while(register == 0); Now the register can get changed by the device, but it seems to be an obvious that you can optimize this to while(TRUE); Now, with this \"optimization\" that the compiler might make, you will never notice when you can read from the disk. So you would mark register as volatile to tell the compiler that he should not optimize it. Do you know some better examples? Perhaps short C examples with real code where you can actually see the difference? Further reading When exactly do you use the volatile keyword in Java?

Short answer -7 Long answer Signed integers are two's complement binary values that can be used to represent both positive and negative integer values. Source: Intels IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manuals , page 83 When you want to get the two's complement representation of -13, you have to get the binary representation of 13, invert the digits and add one. As 13 is 1101 in binary, -13 looks like this on a 32 bit machine: 1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.0011 So two results might be logical: 0111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1001 or 1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1001 Lets get the assembly code: gcc -S -O0 test.c .file \"test.c\" .section .rodata .LC0: .string \"%i\\n\" .text .globl main .type main, @function main: .LFB0: .cfi_startproc pushl %ebp .cfi_def_cfa_offset 8 .cfi_offset 5, -8 movl %esp, %ebp .cfi_def_cfa_register 5 andl $-16, %esp subl $16, %esp movl $-7, 4(%esp) movl $.LC0, (%esp) call printf leave .cfi_restore 5 .cfi_def_cfa 4, 4 ret .cfi_endproc .LFE0: .size main, .-main .ident \"GCC: (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-2ubuntu1) 4.7.2\" .section .note.GNU-stack,\"\",@progbits In line 18 you can see that the bitshift already happened. When you introduce a variable for a , you can see that the compiler makes use of the assembly command sarl %eax or sarl $2, %eax when you shift by two. When you take a look at Oracles IA-32 Assembly Language Reference Manual , page 56, you find: sar right shifts (signed divides) a byte, word, or long value for a count speciﬁed by an immediate value and stores the quotient in that byte, word, or long respectively. The second variation right shifts by a count value speciﬁed in the CL register. sar rounds toward negative inﬁnity; the high-order bit remains unchanged . This means, 1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1111.1001 is correct.

A first step should be to save your data (especially your subscriptions). You can do that with Google Takeout . You could also sign a petition against closing Google Reader , but I doubt that this will have any effect. Currently, 106,712 people support this petition, though. How I used Google Reader Most important for me was the Chrome plugin: Google Reader in Chrome - Icon indicates number of new items Google Reader in Chrome - Show all new items The website offered a nice, clean way to administrate my 109 Feeds. Last (and least) the Android App. I don't have my smartphone long enough to really use this app, but it is one of 10 Apps I've currently installed.

It allowed me to sign in with Google, import my subscriptions and it looked familiar: BazQux Reader Another point for BazQux: It supports OPML-Export (Click on the icon at the top right corner → Subscriptions → Export OPML) But now the drawbacks: 9 $/year no Chrome plugin no Android App Bloglovin' Bloglovin sends you emails with your feeds. Those emails don't have an unsubscribe link. Bloglovin' is another WebService that looks very nice and is free, seems to be a real alternative. While importing my subscriptions, I got a 504 Gateway Time-out, but it imported my feeds anyway. bloglovin The service seems to be free, they have an Android App and an iPhone App , but no Google Chrome App and I can't sign in with Google. Bloglovin' does not provide an export function. Good Noows It seems to get better. Good Noows lets me sign in with Google, offers an import function and has a Chrome App . I seems to be free. Good Noows However, it has no Android App and seems not to support export. Bloglines Bloglines offers an export function! I can't login with Google, but I can import my 109 Feeds.

It can't really replace a camera as the quality is ugly. Just take a close look at the photo above. This was taken with Nexus 4. Sadly, if you don't install apps like AirDroid , it can't replace a USB stick or a MP3 player. Yes, you can use Google Music and that works, but I would like to be able to copy MP3s from my laptop computer to my smartphone. Directly. With a USB-cable and without having to use the internet. It does replace a notepad, if you only use it for writing texts and not for drawing or math. And, finally, at the moment it doesn't even replace my old phone because of the SIM-problem I've explained above. But as soon as this is fixed, the Nexus 4 will replace my Motorola W156.

Does it set the execute-flag only for the user? Or for all three - user, group, others? Try and find out. You might want to remove all rights with chmod 000 filename before you start. Did you know that you can search for file permissions with find /home/ -perm 777 ? SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit Files Sometimes, you want to execute programs as root, although the user who started the execution isn't root. Take passwd, the program that allows users to change passwords, for example: moose@pc07:/usr/bin$ ls -l | grep passwd$ -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 53812 2011 -02-14 23 :11 gpasswd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 13612 2012 -11-06 21 :41 htpasswd -rwsr-xr-x 1 root lpadmin 13540 2012 -12-04 16 :24 lppasswd -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 37140 2011 -02-14 23 :11 passwd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5070304 2012 -04-24 23 :38 smbpasswd -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 9688 2013 -01-18 17 :59 vino-passwd Instead of \"x\" in the user-execution-row, it states \"s\". That means, you can execute it and it has the SUID-bit set. If \"x\" wasn't set, the \"S\" would be in a capital letter. When you change your password, you need to edit /etc/shadow . This file has very limited access rights: -rw-r----- and is owned by \"root\" and group \"shadow\": moose@pc07:/etc$ ls -l | grep shadow$ -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 813 2013 -01-24 06 :21 gshadow -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1274 2013 -01-24 06 :21 shadow Here is more about shadow file . The SGID (set group id) bit works similar to the SUID (set user id) bit. When you want to execute something with as the group of the file, you set the SGID bit. The sticky bit seems to be used for programs to stick in memory after it was finished. You can set the sticky bit like this: chmod +t testfile or like that: chmod 1777 testfile Folders suid: is ignored on UNIX and Linux systems sgid: new files and subdirectories created within this folder inherit the folders group ID t: when the sticky bit is set, only owners may change the filename or delete files Type The first column of ls -l tells you the type of the item: -: a file b: a block device c: a character device d: a directory l: a symbolic link p: pipe s: a socket moose@pc07:/dev$ ls -l total 0 crw------- 1 root video 10 , 175 2013 -03-04 10 :01 agpgart crw-rw----+ 1 root audio 14 , 4 2013 -03-04 10 :01 audio drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 640 2013 -03-04 12 :59 block drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 100 2013 -03-04 12 :59 bsg drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 60 2013 -03-04 10 :01 bus lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2013 -03-04 10 :01 cdrom -> sr0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2013 -03-04 10 :01 cdrw -> sr0 crw-rw----+ 1 root audio 14 , 3 2013 -03-04 10 :01 dsp lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2013 -03-04 10 :01 dvd -> sr0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2013 -03-04 10 :01 dvdrw -> sr0 crw-rw---- 1 root root 10 , 61 2013 -03-04 10 :01 ecryptfs crw-rw---- 1 root video 29 , 0 2013 -03-04 10 :01 fb0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 2013 -03-04 10 :01 fd -> /proc/... crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1 , 7 2013 -03-04 10 :01 full crw-rw-rw- 1 root fuse 10 , 229 2013 -03-04 10 :01 fuse crw-rw---- 1 root root 251 , 0 2013 -03-04 18 :14 hidraw0 crw-rw---- 1 root root 10 , 228 2013 -03-04 10 :01 hpet drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 380 2013 -03-04 18 :14 input crw-rw---- 1 root root 1 , 11 2013 -03-04 10 :01 kmsg srw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 2013 -03-04 10 :01 log brw-rw---- 1 root disk 7 , 0 2013 -03-04 10 :01 loop0 [ ... ] stat You can display quite a lot of information of a file with stat: moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ stat testfile File: ` testfile ' Size: 13 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: 801h/2049d Inode: 923339 Links: 1 Access: ( 0777 /-rwxrwxrwx ) Uid: ( 1000 / moose ) Gid: ( 1000 /moose ) Access: 2013 -03-04 21 :31:52.154187243 +0100 Modify: 2013 -03-04 21 :31:51.154184098 +0100 Change: 2013 -03-04 21 :31:51.154184098 +0100 The content of the file is \"Hello World.\" (12 characters) Attributes According to the manpage of chattr: The `c', 's', and `u' attributes are not honored by the ext2 and ext3 filesystems as implemented in the current mainline Linux kernels. These attributes may be implemented in future versions of the ext2 and ext3 filesystems. Version I've just learned that you can give files version-attributes: moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ lsattr -v 1338 -----------------e- ./testfile You can set the version like this: chattr -v 1339 testfile Append only This one is weird. Theoretically, it should allow me to append to a file, but not to change / delete anything in the file. First of all, I had to use sudo to add this attribute: sudo chattr +a testfile Then, I had all permissions: moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ stat testfile File: ` testfile ' Size: 13 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: 801h/2049d Inode: 923339 Links: 1 Access: ( 0777 /-rwxrwxrwx ) Uid: ( 1000 / moose ) Gid: ( 1000 /moose ) Access: 2013 -03-04 21 :31:52.154187243 +0100 Modify: 2013 -03-04 21 :31:51.154184098 +0100 Change: 2013 -03-04 21 :33:55.154184312 +0100 moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ lsattr -----a-----------e- ./testfile But I couldn't append to the file with gedit. With bash, it worked fine: moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ echo \"One more line \" >> testfile moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ cat testfile Hello World. One more line So I guess I found another bug in gEdit. Immutable You can mark a file as immutable with sudo chattr +i testfile . It's funny, you can't see that with ls -l , you have to use lsattr . I guess if you manage to get root privileges and want to troll somebody, you could set this bit. I think this might take quite a while until you recognize it. Secure deletion and undeletable When secure deletion is set with chattr +s testfile the operating system overwrites the file with random data when it is deleted. chattr +u testfile makes your file undeletable. This is strange. You can still delete the file with rm , but the system will not overwrite it. I've just asked a question on SE . Synchronous update when you set chattr +S testfile the file gets directly written to the HDD and not buffered by the kernel cache.","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Linux access rights and attributes"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/check-file-systems-maximum-path-depth/","text":"Today, I've wondered how deep a path could be at maximum. I've guessed the file system may be limiting that, but perhaps also some tools that I use for basic operations like listing a folders contents would fail before. So I've created the following C-Snippet to test it: #include <sys/stat.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include <stdlib.h> int i = 0 ; int returnCode ; char * pathname ; void giveInformation () { printf ( \"return code \\t\\t : %i \\n \" , returnCode ); printf ( \"Created sub-directories \\t : %i \\n \" , i ); printf ( \"length of pathname \\t : %i \\n \" , strlen ( pathname )); if ( strlen ( pathname ) <= 80 ) { printf ( \"Path \\t\\t\\t : %s \\n \" , pathname ); } } int main () { pathname = \"/home/moose/Desktop/Test\" ; char * ext = \"/one\" ; returnCode = 0 ; int maxDir = 1000000 ; while ( i < maxDir && returnCode == 0 ) { char * newName = malloc ( strlen ( pathname ) + strlen ( ext ) + 1 ); strcpy ( newName , pathname ); strcat ( newName , ext ); returnCode = mkdir ( newName , 0777 ); if ( i != 0 ) { // if you remove this line, your system gets very slow: free ( pathname ); } pathname = newName ; i ++ ; } giveInformation (); return 0 ; } Now run it: $ time ./createDirectories return code : -1 Created sub-directories : 1018 length of pathname : 4096 real 0m0.281s user 0m0.004s sys 0m0.180s Ok, something went wrong at the end. Lets see what crashes when I enter this path in Gnome terminal $ cd one/one/one .... one/ $ mkdir two $ cd two cd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: File name too long Strangely, it showed me a path /home/moose/.../one/one/one/one/tw$ . No, this is not a typo. It showed tw, not two. So, maybe the path can get only that long? Now I created a folder called \"three\" and one called \"this\". I entered both of them with cd, both showed /home/moose/.../one/one/th . So I guess this is a problem of Gnome Terminal and not a limitation of the file system. Let's see what Nautilus does. I once got Nautilus to crash , I think I get it another time: Contents, according to nautilus: 1,016 items, totalling 4.0 MB Then I've opened the folder \"one\" and double clicked as fast as I could. CPU utilization: 100%, but no crash. And 995 items are left ☺ Now a single double click causes 100% CPU utilization for about 25 seconds. When I use a single character for sub-directories, I get: moose@pc07:~/Desktop/Test$ ./createDirectories return code : -1 Created sub-directories : 2036 length of pathname : 4096 Number of directories in one directory Do you know how many folders can fit into one folder? Well, lets find out: #include <sys/stat.h> #include <sys/types.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> #include <stdlib.h> int i = 0 ; int returnCode ; char * pathname ; /** http://stackoverflow.com/a/440240/562769 */ void gen_random ( char * s , const int len ) { static const char alphanum [] = \"0123456789\" \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < len ; ++ i ) { s [ i ] = alphanum [ rand () % ( sizeof ( alphanum ) - 1 )]; } s [ len ] = 0 ; } void giveInformation () { printf ( \"return code \\t\\t : %i \\n \" , returnCode ); printf ( \"Created sub-directories \\t : %i \\n \" , i ); printf ( \"length of pathname \\t : %i \\n \" , strlen ( pathname )); if ( strlen ( pathname ) <= 80 ) { printf ( \"Path \\t\\t\\t : %s \\n \" , pathname ); } } int main () { pathname = \"/home/moose/Desktop/Test/test/\" ; returnCode = 0 ; int maxDir = 1000000 ; while ( i < maxDir && returnCode == 0 ) { // get unique name char * foldername = malloc ( 50 + 1 ); gen_random ( foldername , 50 ); char * completePath = malloc ( strlen ( pathname ) + strlen ( foldername ) + 1 ); strcpy ( completePath , pathname ); strcat ( completePath , foldername ); returnCode = mkdir ( completePath , 0777 ); free ( foldername ); free ( completePath ); i ++ ; } giveInformation (); return 0 ; } I've executed it and after eight minutes I canceled the execution. $ ls | wc -l 378463 Ok, not a million folders, but 378.463 is also quite a lot. When I try to open this folder with Nautilus, I get 140% CPU utilization by Nautilus. Quite impressive, for only showing some folders. You should probably not execute the script above, as deleting the folder isn't that easy .

In a paging system, programs and data stored on disk are divided into equal, fixed sized blocks called pages, and main memory is divided into blocks of the same size called frames. Exactly one page can fit in one frame. Physical memory is divided into parts called „frame\" and logical memory is divided into parts called „page\".

Mutual exclusion: Eine Ressource kann nicht gleichzeitig von mehreren Prozessen benutzt werden Hold and wait: Ein Prozess, der bereits mindestens eine Ressource hält, wartet auf mindestens eine andere Ressource No preemption: Zugeteilte Ressourcen können einem Prozess nicht wieder entzogen werden. Er muss diese selbst freigeben. Circular wait: Es gibt eine Menge von Prozessen $\\{P_0, P_1, \\dots, P_n\\}$, wobei $P_0$ auf eine Ressource wartet, die $P_1$ hält, $P_1$ auf eine Ressource wartet, die $P_2$ hält, ..., $P_n$ auf eine Ressource wartet, die $P_0$ hält. Was kann man in Bezug auf das Deadlock-Problem machen? Prevention Avoidance Detection: Prozess abschießen Rollback Vogel-Strauß-Algorithmus : Der User wird sich schon drum kümmern, z.B. indem er einen Prozess abschießt ( kill -9 ) oder indem er den PC vom Strom nimmt. Erklären Sie Raid 0 - 5. Raid 0: Striping. Platten werden \"aneinandergehängt\". Raid 1: Mirroring. Daten werden auf mehrere Platten gespiegelt. Raid 2: Fehlerkorrigierender Hamming-code. Raid 3: Byteweise Parität. Raid 4: Blockweise Parität. Raid 5: Blockweise, verteilte Parität. Warum verwenden wir Seitentabellen? Könnte man nicht einfach im Hauptspeicher je zwei Datenwörter kombinieren, wobei das erste die Metainformationen (z.B. Zugriffsrechte, Prozess-ID) und das zweite die Daten enthält? Prinzipiell wollen wir in einer x86-Architektur, dass sich die Hardware um das Paging kümmert. Bei MIPS sieht das wohl anders aus ( Quelle ). Wenn man sich für jedes Datenwort ein Datenwort mit Metainformationen merken würde, hätte man sehr viel Overhead. Diese Informationen hat man bei Paging auf IA-32 nur jede 4096 Byte! (Allgemein ist Overhead übrigens eine Begründung, die häufig stimmt.) Falls man es wirklich genau wissen will, sollte man wohl die IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manuals lesen. Das sind ja nur 3044 Seiten. Einstufige Seitentabellen sind deutlich einfacher zu verstehen und zu implementieren. Warum verwendet man sie nicht auf 64 Bit Systemen? Sie würden zu viel Speicher benötigen. Es wird eine Seitentabelle pro Prozess benötigt. Die Größe einer einstufigen Seitentabelle berechnet sich wie folgt: Sei $m$ die Größe des Hauptspeichers in Byte, $p$ die Größe einer Seite in Byte und $a$ die Anzahl der zusätzlichen Bit pro Seite (Access Control bits, validity. Siehe StackExchange ). Dann gilt: Größe der Seitentabelle = Größe eines Seiteneintrages · Anzahl der Seiten $= \\lceil \\frac{\\log_2(\\frac{m}{p}) + a}{8}\\rceil \\text{Byte} \\cdot \\frac{2&#94;{64} \\text{ Byte}}{p \\text{ Byte}}$ Typischerweise gilt: $m = 4 GB = 4 \\cdot 2&#94;{30} \\text{ Byte} = 2&#94;{32} \\text{ Byte}$, $p = 4096 \\text{ Byte}$ und $a = 8$. Daraus folgt eine Seitengröße von 4 Byte und 4.503.599.627.370.496 Seiten. Das ergibt eine Seitentabellengröße von 16 Petabyte. Wenn man nur Segmentierung nutzt, wie kommt man dann von der logischen Adresse auf die physische? Segmentation: Logical to linear address ( source ) Wie ist ein Inode aufgebaut? Struktur eines Inodes Wie groß kann eine Datei maximal werden, wenn man Inodes mit jeweils einem indirekten, doppelt indirektem und dreifach indirektem Block hat? Sei $b$ die Größe eines Blocks in Byte und ein Zeiger belege 4 Byte. Dann berechnet sich die maximale Dateigröße in Byte wie folgt: $12 \\cdot b + \\frac{b}{4} \\cdot b+ \\frac{\\frac{b}{4} \\cdot b}{4} \\cdot b + \\frac{\\frac{\\frac{b}{4} \\cdot b}{4} \\cdot b}{4} \\cdot b = 12 \\cdot b + \\frac{b&#94;2}{4} + \\frac{b&#94;3}{16} + \\frac{b&#94;4}{64}$ Bei einer Blockgröße von 1024 Byte sind das 17,25 GB ( Rechnung ), bei einer Blockgröße von 4096 Byte sogar 4,40 TB ( Rechnung )!

A quite good work-around is MathJax , but it is a work-around. Native support would be nice. With Chrome 24, they have added MathML support, but its still not optimal: The font doesn't look very nice (see MathML Torture Test and image below) Multiscripts seems not to work big brackets get a whitespace in the middle (see image below) Scriptlevel seems not to work (see MathML Browser test ) Here is an image where you can see some of the problems: MathML rendered with Chrome 24 In Chrome 25, MathML was deactivated.

Webkit MathML project , Webkit MathML master bug Stop Animations Sometimes I would like to be able to stop animations. It can be very useful to be able to stop animations if you want to explain something in the animation. For example, this page on Wikipedia has some animations. If you give private lessons in math to another person, you might want to tell something to the single images of the animation. But I am quite sure, that you can't speak that fast. It would also be nice if you were able to stop all animations on the page. Regrettably, some webmasters carry the usage of animations to excess. What do I still miss? Disable sound for tabs Sometimes I watch a movie while I play a flash game. Some flash games don't offer an option to mute them. So I would like to get the possibility to disable sound for one tab. It could look like this. Disable the sound of a tab UPDATE: This is issue 3541 . Spell checker I write Blogs in German and in English. So I would like a spell-checker option at the bottom-left corner to switch languages: Spell checker PDF page numbers It would be great, if I could see the number of the page your currently on. Sometimes PDF-Documents don't even have numbers (e.g. LaTeX beamer slides). What do you do if you have a question to one slide if there are dozens of slides? Manually count them, to get the page number you're looking for? UPDATE : You actually can jump to any page and share it as links! You only have to add #page=123 . For example, you can take a look at this huge TikZ PDF manual . UPDATE2 : You could automatically adjust this #page=123 string according to the page that gets currently viewed. This would make sharing much easier and it would fix the issue that you don't know where you. Another advantage of this solution is that it doesn't bloat up the user interface. UPDATE3 : I finally found it! It's issue 66900 Security Disabling Extensions Auto-Disable extensions for https. Only PayPal, Amazon, Ebay, GMail and my bank accounts work with https.

I'll give you an algorithm how to do it. Test cases First of all, we should think about how lines can be arranged: Testcase T1 Testcase T2 Testcase T3 Testcase T4 Testcase T5 Testcase T6 Testcase F1 Testcase F2 Testcase F3 Testcase F4 Testcase F5 Testcase F6 Testcase F7 Testcase F8 Bounding boxes You can draw boxes around line segments such that the edges of the boxes are in parallel to the coordinate axes: Two line segments with their bounding boxes With this image in mind, it is obvious that the bounding boxes need to intersect if the lines should intersect. At this point you have to make a decision: If the endpoint of one line is on the other line, is this an intersection? I think so. If two lines have at least one point in common, they intersect. If two bounding boxes have at least one point in common, they intersect. It is much easier to check if two bounding boxes intersect. It's simply: /** * Check if bounding boxes do intersect. If one bounding box * touches the other, they do intersect. * @param a first bounding box * @param b second bounding box * @return <code>true</code> if they intersect, * <code>false</code> otherwise. */ public boolean doBoundingBoxesIntersect ( Point [] a , Point [] b ) { return a [ 0 ]. x <= b [ 1 ]. x && a [ 1 ]. x >= b [ 0 ]. x && a [ 0 ]. y <= b [ 1 ]. y && a [ 1 ]. y >= b [ 0 ]. y ; } If you have difficulties to understand why this works, take a look at this great animation for this formula . The algorithm Flowchart how to check if two lines intersect Looks quite simple, doesn't it? Cross product Well, you might notice that you need to check if one line intersects with a given line segment. To check this, you have to understand one cool idea: You can definie a cross product for points: \\begin{align} \\times_P&: Point \\times Point \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\times_P(a, b) &:= a.x \\cdot b.y - b.x \\cdot a.y; \\end{align} This cross product has one nice characteristics: \\(a \\times_P b = 0 \\Leftrightarrow a\\) and \\(b\\) are on one line through origin You can verify this. If you take two points on a line through origin, they have the same slope \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\) : $$ \\begin{align} 0 &= a \\times_P b\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow 0 &= a.x \\cdot b.y - b.x \\cdot a.y\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow b.x \\cdot a.y &= a.x \\cdot b.y\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{a.y}{a.x} &= \\frac{b.y}{b.x} \\end{align} $$ Ok, now you can check if a point is on a line: /** * Checks if a Point is on a line * @param a line (interpreted as line, although given as line * segment) * @param b point * @return <code>true</code> if point is on line, otherwise * <code>false</code> */ public boolean isPointOnLine ( LineSegment a , Point b ) { // Move the image, so that a.first is on (0|0) LineSegment aTmp = new LineSegment ( new Point ( 0 , 0 ), new Point ( a . second . x - a . first . x , a . second . y - a . first . y )); Point bTmp = new Point ( b . x - a . first . x , b . y - a . first . y ); double r = crossProduct ( aTmp . second , bTmp ); return Math . abs ( r ) < EPSILON ; } The second cool characteristic of the cross product is that it can be used to determine if a point b is left or right of the line through the origin and a point a: /** * Checks if a point is right of a line. If the point is on the * line, it is not right of the line. * @param a line segment interpreted as a line * @param b the point * @return <code>true</code> if the point is right of the line, * <code>false</code> otherwise */ public boolean isPointRightOfLine ( LineSegment a , Point b ) { // Move the image, so that a.first is on (0|0) LineSegment aTmp = new LineSegment ( new Point ( 0 , 0 ), new Point ( a . second . x - a . first . x , a . second . y - a . first . y )); Point bTmp = new Point ( b . x - a . first . x , b . y - a . first . y ); return crossProduct ( aTmp . second , bTmp ) < 0 ; } When we have one line \\(a\\) through the origin and one line segment \\(b\\) , you can check if \\(b\\) crosses \\(a\\) by checking if the end points of \\(b\\) are on different sides of \\(a\\) : /** * Check if line segment first touches or crosses the line that is * defined by line segment second. * * @param first line segment interpreted as line * @param second line segment * @return <code>true</code> if line segment first touches or * crosses line second, * <code>false</code> otherwise. */ public boolean lineSegmentTouchesOrCrossesLine ( LineSegment a , LineSegment b ) { return isPointOnLine ( a , b . first ) || isPointOnLine ( a , b . second ) || ( isPointRightOfLine ( a , b . first ) &#94; isPointRightOfLine ( a , b . second )); } Now you have everything you need: /** * Check if line segments intersect * @param a first line segment * @param b second line segment * @return <code>true</code> if lines do intersect, * <code>false</code> otherwise */ public boolean doLinesIntersect ( LineSegment a , LineSegment b ) { Point [] box1 = a . getBoundingBox (); Point [] box2 = b . getBoundingBox (); return doBoundingBoxesIntersect ( box1 , box2 ) && lineSegmentTouchesOrCrossesLine ( a , b ) && lineSegmentTouchesOrCrossesLine ( b , a ); } By the way, testcase F5 is the only reason why you need doBoundingBoxesIntersect(box1, box2) . All other tests still pass if you remove this function. Where do two line segments intersect? When you know that two line segments intersect, you can also calculate the intersection. The intersection could be a line or only a point. I did this with JavaScript: Ihr Browser kann leider keine eingebetteten Frames anzeigen. Die Seite ist hier . This is the code that checks for line segments: /** You know that lines a and b have an intersection and now you want to get it! */ function getIntersection ( a , b ) { /* the intersection [(x1,y1), (x2, y2)] it might be a line or a single point. If it is a line, then x1 = x2 and y1 = y2. */ var x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ; if ( a [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] == a [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]) { // Case (A) // As a is a perfect vertical line, it cannot be represented // nicely in a mathematical way. But we directly know that // x1 = a [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; x2 = x1 ; if ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] == b [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]) { // Case (AA): all x are the same! // Normalize if ( a [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] > a [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) { a = { \"first\" : a [ \"second\" ], \"second\" : a [ \"first\" ]}; } if ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] > b [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) { b = { \"first\" : b [ \"second\" ], \"second\" : b [ \"first\" ]}; } if ( a [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] > b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ]) { var tmp = a ; a = b ; b = tmp ; } // Now we know that the y-value of a[\"first\"] is the // lowest of all 4 y values // this means, we are either in case (AAA): // a: x--------------x // b: x---------------x // or in case (AAB) // a: x--------------x // b: x-------x // in both cases: // get the relavant y intervall y1 = b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ]; y2 = Math . min ( a [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ], b [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]); } else { // Case (AB) // we can mathematically represent line b as // y = m*x + t <=> t = y - m*x // m = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2) var m , t ; m = ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) / ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]); t = b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - m * b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; y1 = m * x1 + t ; y2 = y1 } } else if ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] == b [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]) { // Case (B) // essentially the same as Case (AB), but with // a and b switched x1 = b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; x2 = x1 ; var tmp = a ; a = b ; b = tmp ; var m , t ; m = ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) / ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]); t = b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - m * b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; y1 = m * x1 + t ; y2 = y1 } else { // Case (C) // Both lines can be represented mathematically var ma , mb , ta , tb ; ma = ( a [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - a [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) / ( a [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] - a [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]); mb = ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"y\" ]) / ( b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ] - b [ \"second\" ][ \"x\" ]); ta = a [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - ma * a [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; tb = b [ \"first\" ][ \"y\" ] - mb * b [ \"first\" ][ \"x\" ]; if ( ma == mb ) { // Case (CA) // both lines are in parallel.

I guess it finally saved me some time and it gives me some confidence that my code works. I should update my system. I'm still using Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS. Especially, I have Eclipse 3.5.2. This means I could not try EclEmma to test my code coverage ☹ LaTeX is great. I've created all images with LaTeX and it was quite fast after I got the first one. Here is the LaTeX source . edit: I now have a more modern system. So I was able to use EclEmma, which works fine. And I have 100% branch code coverage for this part of code ☺","tags":"Code","title":"How to check if two line segments intersect"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/how-to-create-a-digital-signature/","text":"At first, you have to write your signature on a white sheet of paper.

If your program is computation intensive, you might want to put some extra effort in your program and make use of this wasted computing power. There are two ways to execute your code on multiple cores: Multiprocessing and multithreading. Both, processes and threads, provide the possibility to execute code sequences independently and concurrently. But where is the difference? When you execute code in multiple processes , the operating system handles the scheduling. It decides when which process gets executed and tries to find an optimal order. Every process has its own memory segment. A process is sometimes also called \"kernel level thread\". When you execute code in multiple threads , all threads have one process they belong to (see Multi-Threading models , also from Java ). Every set of threads that have the same process share their memory. In Java, you will use multithreading most of the time. I will only write about multithreading, but you can create multiple processes wiht ProcessBuilder . Java Basics for Multithreading All important lessons you need to learn are covered in Java Concurrency Tutorial . If you're really interested in multithreading, you should read this. You can put the part that can get executed concurrently in a separate class that implements the interface Runnable . This class has a method called run(). You can create a new Thread(Runnable) by calling start() . Here is an example: Sum public class Sum implements Runnable { private final int UpperEnd ; public Sum ( int upperEnd ) { UpperEnd = upperEnd ; } @Override public void run () { for ( int i = 0 ; i < UpperEnd ; i ++) { RaceCondition . bigSum ++; } } } Main import java.util.ArrayList ; import java.util.List ; public class Main { public static int BIG_NR ; public static int NR_THREADS ; public static long bigSum ; public static void main ( String [] args ) { if ( args . length < 2 ) { System . err . println ( \"You should specify the number \" + \"of threads and BIG_NR. Call me like this:\\n\" + \"java -jar RaceCondition.jar 5 20000\\n\" + \"This will create 5 Threads which try to count\" + \"up to 2000000.\\n\" + \"-v will show status \" + \"information \" ); return ; } boolean verbose = false ; if ( args . length > 2 ) { verbose = true ; } NR_THREADS = Integer . parseInt ( args [ 0 ]); BIG_NR = Integer . parseInt ( args [ 1 ]); List < Thread > threads = new ArrayList < Thread >(); for ( int i = 0 ; i < NR_THREADS ; i ++) { Runnable task = new Sum ( BIG_NR ); Thread worker = new Thread ( task ); worker . start (); threads . add ( worker ); } int running = 0 ; do { running = 0 ; for ( Thread thread : threads ) { if ( thread . isAlive ()) { running ++; } } if ( verbose ) { System . out . println ( \"Remaining threads: \" + running ); } } while ( running > 0 ); System . out . println ( RaceCondition . bigSum ); } } Call it like this: java Main 5 2000 Race Conditions When you execute the code above, the output will vary. Why is this the case? In short: The execution order is not defined and RaceCondition.bigSum++ is not atomic. Let's imagine that you call this with two threads only: java Main 2 2000 Now you could get this execution order: Thread 1: Loads RaceCondition.bigSum . It is 0. Thread 2: Executes completely. Now RaceCondition.bigSum is 2000 Thread 1: Increases the loaded value of RaceCondition.bigSum by 1. Now it is 1. Thread 1: Finishes it's execution. The Value of RaceCondition.bigSum is 2000 = BIG_NR. Ok, we can obviously get values in \\([\\text{BIG}\\_\\text{NR}, \\text{NR}\\_\\text{THREADS} \\cdot \\text{BIG}\\_\\text{NR}]\\) . Can we get smaller values? Yes, we can! Execute: java Main 50 20000 Thread 1 loads bigSum . It's 0. Thread 2 loads bigSum . It's 0. Thread 3 - 50 execute completely. Thread 2 executes until it is at the latest bigSum++ . The latest doesn't execute. Thread 1 increases the loaded value from 0 to 1 and writes 1 back Thread 2 loads bigSum = 1 Thread 1 executes and finishes. Thread 2 increases the loaded value from 1 to 2 and writes 2 back. You can get all values in \\([2, \\text{NR}\\_\\text{THREADS} \\cdot \\text{BIG}\\_\\text{NR}]\\) ! Usually, you don't want to get different results when you give the same input to your program. How can you fix this? Take a look at AtomicLong and replace the long bigNr by the AtomicLong bigNr . Playing with BASH If you want to execute this more often, you could save it as a executable JAR and execute the following bash script. It takes three arguments: \\(1: The number of times you execute a the program with a fixed number of THREADS</li> <li>\\) 2: The maximum number of THREADS you would like to use $3: BIG_NR The script executes the program \\($1 \\cdot $2\\) times. The output gets divided by the number of threads and the result is saved in raceCondition.tmp. Every line is one execution of the program. When the second number is BIG_NR, then no race conditions occured. rm raceCondition.tmp touch raceCondition.tmp # Up to $2 threads for (( threads = 1 ; threads< = $2 ; threads++ )) do for (( c = 1 ; c< = $1 ; c++ )) do # $threads threads, count up to $3 in each thread thisExecutionSum = ` java -jar RaceCondition.jar $threads $3 ` # Normalize: thisExecutionSum / number of threads normalizedSum = ` awk -vsome = $thisExecutionSum -vtotal = $threads 'BEGIN { printf(\"%d\\n\", some/total); exit } ' ` echo -e $threads \"\\t\" $normalizedSum >> raceCondition.tmp done done","tags":"Code","title":"Basic Multithreading in Java"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/flipflops-und-latches/","text":"Flipflops und Latches sind 1-bit Datenspeicher. Es gibt sie als synchrone und als asynchrone Varianten, wobei „synchron\" nur bedeutet, dass das Bauteil zusätzlich einen Takteingang hat. Der wichtigste (und einzige?) Unterschied zwischen Flipflops und Latches ist, dass Flipflops Taktflankengesteuert sind und Latches Pegelgesteuert sind. Das heißt, Flipflops können nur dann ihren Wert ändern, wenn der anliegende Takt von 0 auf 1 wechselt. Latches hingegen können ihren Wert immer ändern, wenn der anliegende Takt auf 1 ist. Beide haben die gleichen Ansteuertabellen, können aber unterschiedliche Zeitdiagramme haben. Interesannt sind vor allem die Ansteuertabellen. Dabei darf man sich nicht von der Art, wie diese aufgeschrieben werden, verwirren lassen: \\(q&#94;t\\) ist der Zustand des Flipflops zum Zeitpunkt \\(t\\) . Analog dazu ist \\(q&#94;{t+1}\\) der Zustand des Flipflops zum Zeitpunkt \\(t+1\\) . Nun steht rechts in der Tabelle, welche Signale man braucht um den Zustand \\(q&#94;{t+1}\\) zu erreichen, wenn man im Zustand \\(q&#94;t\\) ist. D-Latch D-Flipflop D-Flipflops D-Flipflops ignorieren im Prinzip den aktuellen Zustand und setzt den neuen Zustand einfach auf das d-Signal.

RS-Flipflops Das RS-Flipflop bietet zwei Möglichkeiten: Entweder man resettet es, dann wird der neue Zustand 0, oder man setzt es. Dann ist der neue Zustand 1.

Dazu braucht man eine Schaltfunktion \\(f:\\{0,1\\}&#94;n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\) in disjunktiver Normalform (DNF). Zu betonen ist, dass man keine Minimalform bekommt, da das Überdeckungsproblem noch gelöst werden muss. Dies kann man z.B. mit der zweiten Quineschen Tabelle machen. Dazu baut man eine Tabelle auf. Ich nenne sie mal Consensus-Tabelle. Diese hat 4 Spalten: Nr. Gebildet aus Würfel - eine Spalte für jeden der \\(n\\) Parameter der Schaltfunktion \\(f\\) Gestrichen wegen Nun ergibt jeder Minterm der DNF eine Zeile in der Consensus-Tabelle. Die Reihenfolge ist dabei egal. Die Nr. wird fortlaufend von 1 an gesetzt, die Spalte „Gebildet aus\" bleibt erst mal leer. Nun zieht man eine Linie, um die folgenden Zeilen abzutrennen. Diesen abgetrennten Teil nennen ich nun „Block\". Man vergleicht nun jede Zeile mit den darüber liegenden Zeilen. : Falls an einer bestimmten Stelle nur eine der Zeilen ein don't care hat, wird an dieser Stelle der Wert der anderen Zeile genommen. Diese Spalte zählt also nicht als unterschiedlich. Unterscheiden sich zwei Zeilen nur an einer Stelle, schreibt man eine neue Zeile in den neuen Block. Diese Zeile hat ein don't care an der Stelle, an der sich die beiden Zeilen unterschieden, eine eigene Nummer. Eventuell überdeckt die neue Zeile beide vorhergehenden. Wegen der don't care-Regelung ( ) muss das jedoch nicht der Fall sein. Sobald man alle Zeilen des vorhergehenden Block überprüft hat, kann man wieder eine Linie machen. Das sieht dann etwa so aus (aus Folien von Prof. Dr. Asfour): Consensus-Verfahren Wie man sieht, kann es auch sein, dass eine neue Zeile bereits von einer alten überdeckt wird. Diese Zeilen kann man also direkt streichen. Sobald man keine neuen Zeilen / Blöcke mehr bilden kann, ist man fertig. Die Zeilen, die nicht gestrichen wurden, sind Primimplikanten.

Es muss also eine Schaltfunktion gegeben sein. Es sollte eigentlich zusätzlich Kostenfunktion gegeben sein, aber meist ist das nicht der Fall. Verfahren Gegeben : Eine Schaltfunktion \\(f:\\{0,1\\}&#94;n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}, \\; n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) Schritt 1: Aufstellen der Funktionstabelle. Sie hat die Spalten „Nr.\", die bei 0 beginnt und bis \\(2&#94;n - 1\\) geht. Eine Spalte pro Funktionsparameter (z.B. \\(a, b, c, ...\\) ) Eine Spalte für den Funktionswert \\(f(a,b,c,...)\\) Schritt 2 : Aufstellen der ersten Quinesche Tabelle 0ter Ordnung. Sie hat die Spalten „Nr.\" Eine Spalte pro Parameter „✓\" (Häkchen) In der ersten Quineschen Tabelle stehen nur noch die Zeilen, deren Funktionswert 1 ist. Das sind die sogenannten Minterme. Zusätzlich sind sie nach Anzahl der 1er geordnet. Schritt 3 : \\(i\\) -tes Zusammenfassen Nun erstellt man die erste Quinesche Tabelle \\(i\\) -ter Ordnung. Also beim ersten mal erster Ordnung, beim zweiten Mal zweiter Ordnung, ... Diese Tabellen haben alle die gleichen Spalten und die Zeilen-Anzahl kann sowohl wachsen als auch schrumpfen. Das \\(i\\) gibt dabei die Anzahl der „don't care\" Stellen an, also der Stellen die sowohl 0 als auch 1 sein können. Um aus der ersten Quinesche Tabelle \\((i-1)\\) -ter Ordnung die rsten Quinesche Tabelle \\(i\\) -ter Ordnung zu erstellen, geht man wie folgt vor: Vergleiche alle Zeilen, in denen sich die Anzahl der 1er um genau 1 unterscheidet: Unterscheiden sich Zeile Nr. x und Zeile Nr. y an nur einer Stelle, so schreibe in die Tabelle \\(i\\) ter Ordnung eine neue Zeile. Die Nummer dieser Zeile ist „x, y\" und sie hat an der Stelle, an der sich die Zeilen x und y unterschieden, ein don't care. Hake die Zeilen x und y in der Tabelle \\((i-1)\\) -ter Ordnung ab Es ist möglich, das Zeilen nicht abgehakt werden, weil sie sich mit keiner Zeile zusammenfassen lassen. Das ist ok. Sobald in einem Schritt keine Zusammenfassung mehr möglich ist, ist man hier fertig. Falls noch eine Möglich ist, geht man wieder in Schritt 3. Nun schreibt man alle Zeilen auf, die nicht abgehakt sind. Das sind die Primimplikanten. Schritt 4 : Aufstellen der zweiten Quineschen Tabelle Die zweite Quinesche Tabelle (auch Überdeckungstabelle genannt) hat folgende Spalten: Primimplikanten Eine Spalte pro Minterm. Die Beschriftung ist dabei eine Nr. Eine Spalte „Kosten\" Nun macht man in den Zellen ein Kreuz, in denen der Primimplikant den Minterm abdeckt (also wenn die Nr. im Namen des Minterms vorkommt). Die Kosten muss man pro Primimplikant berechnen. Schritt 5 : Vereinfachen der zweiten Quineschen Tabelle Dieser Schritt erinnert mich irgendwie an Sudoku. Zeilendominanz : Hat eine Zeile a nur x-e an Stellen, wo auch eine andere Zeile b x-e hat und ist Zeile b nicht teurer als a, so kann Zeile a gestrichen werden. Also: Es wird die Zeile mit weniger x gestrichen Spaltendominanz : Überdeckt eine Spalte eine andere Spalte mit ihren x-en, so kann die Spalte mit mehr x-en gestrichen werden. Schritt 6 : Identifizieren von Kernprimimplikanten. Wenn eine Zeile als einzige an einer bestimmten Spalte ein x hat, ist der zugehörige Primimplikant ein Kernprimimplikant. Er muss auf jeden Fall in der Minimalform vorkommen. Diesen schreibt man sich also auf, Streicht die Zeile und alle Spalten, an denen der Kernprimimplikant ein x hatte. Dann geht man zurück zu Schritt 5. Gab es keinen Kernprimimplikanten, geht man zu Schritt 7. Schritt 7 : Handarbeit Ich muss mal nach einem Beispiel suchen, aber ich glaube es ist möglich, dass man die zweite Quinesche Tabelle ab einem gewissen Punkt nicht mehr vereinfachen kann, aber dennoch Zeilen und Spalten übrig sind. Dann muss man „durch scharfes Hinsehen\" (also Brute-Force) die Minimalform finden, oder? Hier bin ich mir nicht ganz sicher. Beispiele Die folgende Aufgabe ist vom Übungsblatt 7 (WS 2012/2013). Herr Terlemez hat mir freundlicherweise erlaubt, sie hier verwenden zu dürfen. (Die offiziellen Aufgaben und Lösungen sind passwortgeschützt.)

But here is another one by him: Pick a License, Any License","tags":"Code","title":"Software Licenses"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/strassen-algorithm-in-python-java-cpp/","text":"This is Part II of my matrix multiplication series. Part I was about simple matrix multiplication algorithms and Part II was about the Strassen algorithm. Part III is about parallel matrix multiplication. The usual matrix multiplication of two \\(n \\times n\\) matrices has a time-complexity of \\(\\mathcal{O}(n&#94;3)\\) . This means, if \\(n\\) doubles, the time for the computation increases by a factor of 8. But you don't have to use that much resources. The Strassen algorithm has a time complexity of \\(\\mathcal O(n&#94;{log_2(7)+o(1)}) \\approx \\cal O(n&#94;{2.807})\\) . The idea is similar to the Karatsuba algorithm for simple multiplication. Basically, you make a tradeof: Instead of one multiplication, you use many additions. As additions are - at least for humans - easier, you might rather like to use many additions. Lets see how the Strassen algortihms execution time compares to the other execution times in Part I. As last time, I'll multiply two \\(2000 \\times 2000\\) matrices that have to be read from a file. Everything - reading, calculation and writing the result - counts to the execution time. The implementations As last time, I've added the scripts to a GIT repository , so feel free to test it on your machine. I will use the I am also happy if you post some of your solutions with running times ☺ If you know other languages, you could create a script for these. I focus on Python, Java and C++. I have implemented only the Strassen algorithm for this post. Please take a look at Wikipedia for a detailed explanation how this algorithm works. The important idea of the algorithm is that you break both matrices into four \\(\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\frac{n}{2}\\) matrices and multiply them in a clever way. Note that you can also use the Strassen algorithm recursively for those \\(\\frac{n}{2} \\times \\frac{n}{2}\\) matrices. You can do this until you have \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrices which are simple numbers. But it does make sense to stop this recursion and use the ikj-algorithm as soon as the matrices are small enough. But what exactly is \"small enough\"? I'll test that. The size when you use the ikj-algorithm is called LEAF_SIZE in my scripts. Note that only leaf sizes of multiples of two matter as the size of the (sub-)matrices that get passed to strassenR are multiples of two. If you post a solution, please consider these restrictions: Input : The input file should get passed with the parameter -i , e.g.: python -i bigMatrix.in or java Shell -i bigMatrix.in The leaf-size should get passed with -l , e.g.: python -i bigMatrix.in -l 32 The standard value for the command line parameter -i should be \"bigMatrix.in\" The user should not have to give the size of the matrix! The two square-matrices that should get multiplied are ... ... read from a text-file. ... represented like this: Every line of one matrix is one line in the text-file. Newlines are only \"\\n\". Every number is separated by \"\\t\". The both matrices are separated by one newline. Output : The result has to get printed to standard output. The result has to be formatted like the input (tabs for separation of number, \\n for marks a new line) Tests and Setting Tests and setting are the same as in the first part.

I am a little bit surprised, that the LEAF_SIZE doesn't matter for Python. I think I have used some very slow operations that are much more important than any speed gains or losses due to LEAF_SIZE. I guess the list creation might be slow. Does anybody know a tool for performance analysis of Python programs? This tool should be able to track which pieces of code got executed most often any preferably visualize it. For Java and C++, the Strassen algorithm had better execution times than the ikj-algorithm and it was also better than any library that I could find. The reasons why librarys perform worse than my implementation might be that pure integer matrices are rather rare. Usually you have double-matrices. Maybe you use different algorithms to keep rounding errors as small as possible (Can anybody provide more information to my speculations?)

Some simple ideas can improve the quality of codes (code that is easier to understand and less loc ) and reduce the probability of tiny mistakes. Tic Tac Toe Battleships Moves of the queen in chess isOnBoard(int x, int y) You should create a method that checks if a coordinate is on your board. This can be as simple as this: public boolean isOnBoard ( int x , int y ) { return 0 <= x && x < width && 0 <= y && y < height ; } Diagonal, horizontal and vertical You can create a method like this: /** * This method checks XYZ and does XYZ. * * @param player the current player * @param xDir -1 if you want to go to the left, 0 if you don't want * to move in x-direction and 1 if you want to go to * the right * @param yDir -1 if you want to go to the bottom, 0 if you don't * want to move in y-direction and 1 if you want to go * to the top */ private void myBoardAction ( Player player , int xDir , int yDir ) { for ( int x = 0 ; x < board . width ; x ++) { for ( int y = 0 ; y < board . height ; y ++) { for ( int c = 0 ; c < SOME_CONSTANT ; c ++) { if ( board . isOnBoard ( x + c * xDir , y + c * yDir ) && board . checkXYZ ( x + c * xDir , y + c * yDir )) { doXYZ (); } } } } } What's so special about it? Well, note how the xDir and yDir parameters change the behavior of the method. If you want to move only to the right, you will call myBoardAction(player, 1, 0) . If you want to go to the top left, you will call myBoardAction(player, -1, 1) . Of course, you can't simply take this piece of code and only change doXYZ() and checkXYZ . You will have to change the starting and and position and maybe add a break. But this thought can be applied to board games quite nice. Please also note that I go from (0|0) to (board.width|board.height) and even add in the inner loop something. So some calls will be out of bound. But because of short-circuit evaluation this works. I don't bother about ends, I simply include the critical parts. Most of the time, it is not much work to check if the call is within the boundary, but finding (and fixing) a bug is much work. Yes, I know, this is more efficient if you use the correct boundaries. But it's only a constant in time difference. And I guess this constant is very small for most games. Ah, and if you want to check a condition for all diagonals, horizontals and verticals the hole board, you can call it like this: myBoardAction ( player , 1 , 1 ); // top right myBoardAction ( player ,- 1 , 1 ); // top left myBoardAction ( player , 1 , 0 ); // vertical myBoardAction ( player , 0 , 1 ); // horizontal This is enough. You don't need more, as you go through the whole board. No need to write redundant code ☺","tags":"Code","title":"Check x-in-a-row for board games"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/cyclic-references-kill-nautilus/","text":"I just wanted to answer an assignment and noticed that cyclic references kill Nautilus.

Ich habe insbesondere bei dem letzem Teil (Cache-Typen und TLBs) das Gefühl, dass ich das noch nicht richtig verstanden habe, deshalb ist der Inhalt hier mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Bitte meldet mir Fehler oder Unstimmigkeiten (per E-Mail an info@martin-thoma.de oder direkt als Kommentar). Allgemeines CPU-Caches sind aus Cache-Zeilen aufgebaut. Diese sind die kleinsten adressierbaren Einheiten im Cache. Die Länge der Cache-Zeilen variiert, aber 32-64 Byte sind üblich. [1] Nun ist der Cache deutlich kleiner als der Hauptspeicher und man muss eine schnelle Möglichkeit haben, Hauptspeicher-Adressen auf den Cache abzubilden. Eine Möglichkeit das zu machen, ist ein sog. „direct mapped cache\". Das ist im Prinzip eine Hash-Funktion, die zusätlich noch schnell von der Hardware umgesetzt werden können muss. Also unterteilt man gedanklich die Hauptspeicheradressen in 3 Teile: Tag Index Block-Offset Der Index gibt direkt die Cache-Zeile an, in der die Daten einer Hauptspeicheradresse landen werden. Es wäre also z.B. möglich, die Pins des Adressbus, auf denen die Index-Bits liegen, auf einen Multiplexer zu legen, der die entsprechende Cache-Zeile durchschaltet. Es gilt also: Index-Länge in Bit = \\(\\log_2(\\text{Cache-Zeilen})\\) Nun kann es passieren, dass viele Hauptspeicher-Adressen in der selben Zeile landen. Um diese unterscheiden zu können, speichert man folgendes in einer Cache-Zeile: Tag Datenblock Flags Der Datenblock beinhaltet die eigentlichen Daten aus dem Hauptspeicher. Benötigt nun ein Programm die Daten aus einer Hauptspeicheradresse, wird der Index dieser Adresse extrahiert und an dieser Cache-Zeile nachgeschaut. Wenn dann die Tags übereinstimmen, ist es die richtige Adresse und man kann die Daten aus dem Cache entnehmen. Da man durch den Block-Offset ja eine ganze Reihe von Hauptspeicher-Adressen zusammenfasst, muss gelten: Größe der Cache-Zeile \\(= 2&#94;{\\text{Länge des Block-offsets}} \\cdot\\) Größe des Inhalts einer Hauptspeicheradresse Der Block-Offset wird nicht weiter verwendet. Es wird schlicht ignoriert. Der Tag muss aktiv im Cache gespeichert werden und die Länge des Tags im Cache muss mindestens so lang sein wie die Tag-Länge der Hauptspeicher- Adresse. Natürlich wird der Tag im Cache genau so lang sein wie der in der Hauptspeicher-Adresse. Man hat ja keinen Speicher zu verschenken. Bei einem Voll-Assoziativem Cache würde es also keinen Index geben. Eine Hauptspeicher-Adresse würde dann nur in Tag und Block-Offset geteilt werden. Bei einem \\(n\\) -fach Satzassoziativem Cache gibt es \\(\\frac{\\text{Cachzeilen}}{n}\\) Sätze mit jeweils \\(n\\) Cachezeilen. Das Datenwort kann nur in einem Satz stehen, dort aber an einer beliebigen Stelle. Nun geht die CPU wie folgt vor: Datenwort mit Hauptspeicheradresse x = $x_\\text{tag}$ | $x_\\text{index}$ | $x_\\text{blockoffset}$ wird benötigt $x_\\text{index}$ = der zu durchsuchende Satz im Cache Dieser Satz wird zu den $n$ Vergleichern durchgeschaltet Jeder Vergleicher vergleich den $x_\\text{tag}$ und den in der Cache-Zeile gespeicherten tag Wird die Adresse gefunden → Cache Hit Datenwort in keiner Cache-Zeile: Cache-Miss, Hauptspeicherzugriff Physical address and virtual address Die physische Adresse entspricht dem, womit man den Speicherbaustein anspricht. Nun kann es möglich sein, dass man mehrere RAM-Bausteine hat oder dass das Programm theoretische mehr Speicher braucht als an Hauptspeicher zur verfügung steht. Dennoch will man als Programmierer einheitlich adressieren. Also nutzt man im Userspace virtuelle Adressen (Im Kernel-Space können sowohl physische als auch virtuelle Adressen genutzt werden, siehe StackOverflow ). Außerdem will man Speicherschutz herstellen. Die virtuellen Adressen sind scheinbar zusammenhängend und der Adressraum ist sehr groß. Der virtuelle Adressraum ist in Blöcke (Pages) unterteilt und die Pages werden von langsamen, aber großen auf schnelle, aber kleine Speichermedien je nach Bedarf aus- oder eingelagert. Das passiert allerdings selten. Um zu sehen, wie häufig das der Fall ist, sollte man sich folgendes anschauen: /proc/swaps /proc/meminfo - ein paar Erklärungen zu meminfo vmstat -s Cache-Modelle Fordert nun ein Prozess die Daten einer virtuellen Adresse an, kommt es nun auf die verschiedenen Cache-Modelle (PIPT, VIPT, VIVIT) an. Es gilt jedoch immer: Die CPU schaut im TLB nach, ob sie direkt erfahren kann, wo die Daten sind. Falls das nicht funktiniert, geht es wie folgt weiter: Physically Indexed, Physically Tagged Hier wird der index und der tag aus der physischen Adresse gezogen. Damit muss zuerst die MMU die virtuelle Adresse in eine physische Adresse umwandeln, bevor man im Cache nachschauen kann. Virtually indexed, physically tagged Man bekommt den Index aus der virtuellen Adresse, kann im Cache nachschauen ob dort überhaupt etwas steht, falls ja muss aber noch die MMU die physische Adresse nachschlagen damit man den tag überprüfen kann. Frage: Wieso steht in den Folien \"No ambiguities\"? Annahme: Wir haben eine virtuelle Adresse 123456789. Der Index sind die Ziffern [4,6] also 456. Nun wird das auf die physische Adresse 123456789 gemappt. Der Tag sind die Ziffern [1,3] also 123. Nun haben wir eine zweite virtuelle Adresse 000456000. Der index sind die Ziffern [4,6] also 456. Die zugehörige phyische Adresse sein 123000000. Der Tag sind die Ziffern [1,3] also 123. Nun müsste doch fehlerhaft ein Cache-Hit herauskommen, oder? Physically Indexed / Virtually Tagged Macht keinen Sinn, weil man Probleme wegen Doppeldeutigkeiten bekommen kann und man auf jeden Fall immer zuerst die MMU nutzen kann. Virtually Indexed / Virtually Tagged Kein MMU-Zugriff benötigt, also schneller als die anderen Varianten.

In Python, you have sort and sorted. In C++, you can use operator overloading . I'll now tell you how to do basic sorting with Java. I will not write about natural language sorting or language-aware sorting. This is only about simple sorting with Java. Sorting without programming First of all, you have to make sure that you understand how sorting works - without Java, just in the real world. What you need: A container \\(C\\) of objects A way to compare two objects of the list at a time. The comparison, lets call it \\(\\leq\\) needs to satisfy the following conditions: totality : \\(\\forall x, y \\in C: x \\leq y \\lor y \\leq x\\) antisymmetry : \\(\\forall x,y \\in C: x \\leq y \\land y \\leq x \\Rightarrow x = y\\) transitivity : \\(\\forall x,y,z \\in C: x \\leq y \\land y \\leq z \\Rightarrow x \\leq z\\) Just think about what you sort in your everyday life: Numbers Words Contries by population Playing cards You can apply different algorithms like selection sort which you would use for numbers or insertion sort which you would use for card games. No matter what algorithm you use, you need to be able to compare the elements. Note that you can compare some objects, like countries, by many measures. You could look at the population, the birth rate or the area. No matter what you use to compare, the this will not influence the way you sort. Collections One way to sort is to implement the interface List . For all datastructures, that implement the interface List or one of its sub-interfaces you can use Collections an go on like this: import java.util.Collections ; import java.util.LinkedList ; import java.util.List ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { List < String > myList = new LinkedList < String >(); myList . add ( \"I\" ); myList . add ( \"think\" ); myList . add ( \"therefore\" ); myList . add ( \"I\" ); myList . add ( \"am\" ); System . out . println ( myList ); Collections . sort ( myList ); System . out . println ( myList ); } } Output: [ I, think, therefore, I, am ] [ I, I, am, therefore, think ] Note that I didn't write a Comparator or implement Comparable as String has one by default. Don't mix Collections and Collection ! A Set is a Collection, but it is not sortable. Collections is a class that you can use for sorting. Like Math , that has utilities like sqrt Arrays import java.util.Arrays ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { String [] myStrings = new String [ 5 ]; myStrings [ 0 ] = \"I\" ; myStrings [ 1 ] = \"think\" ; myStrings [ 2 ] = \"therefore\" ; myStrings [ 3 ] = \"I\" ; myStrings [ 4 ] = \"am\" ; System . out . println ( Arrays . asList ( myStrings )); Arrays . sort ( myStrings ); System . out . println ( Arrays . asList ( myStrings )); } } Interface Comparable This is an example how you could implement Comparable . Country.java public class Country implements Comparable < Country > { int population ; double area ; String name ; public Country ( int population , double area , String name ) { this . population = population ; this . area = area ; this . name = name ; } @Override public int compareTo ( Country o ) { // a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this // object is less than, equal to, or greater than the // specified object. return this . name . compareTo ( o . name ); } @Override public String toString () { return name + \": \" + population ; } } Main.java import java.util.ArrayList ; import java.util.Collections ; import java.util.List ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { List < Country > europe = new ArrayList < Country >(); europe . add ( new Country ( 82000000 , 350000 , \"Germany\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 60000000 , 360000 , \"France\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 20000000 , 100000 , \"Norway\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 30000000 , 500000 , \"Sweden\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 50000000 , 123000 , \"Spain\" )); System . out . println ( europe ); Collections . sort ( europe ); System . out . println ( europe ); } } Output: [ Germany: 81903000 , France: 64667000 , Norway: 4985900 , Sweden: 9514406 , Spain: 47212990 , Switzerland: 8014000 , Monaco: 36371 ] [ France: 64667000 , Germany: 81903000 , Monaco: 36371 , Norway: 4985900 , Spain: 47212990 , Sweden: 9514406 , Switzerland: 8014000 ] You should definitely add JavaDoc and comment what you've compared. Note that it would sort the list in reverse order if you switched this.population - o.population; to o.population - this.population; . This would be bad style, as the JavaDoc of Comparable define the order. If you would like to sort in reverse, you should use Collections.reverse(europe); . You can also use compareTo() within compareTo(): @Override public int compareTo ( Country o ) { return this . name . compareTo ( o . name ); } Comparator If you need to compare objects in multiple ways, you might need to implement Comperator . If you only have to compare objects in one way, I would always use the Interface Comparable. It's easier to use. External Comparator An external Comparator PopulationDensityComperator.java could look like this: import java.util.Comparator ; public class PopulationDensityComperator implements Comparator < Country > { @Override public int compare ( Country o1 , Country o2 ) { double o1Density = o1 . population / o1 . area ; double o2Density = o2 . population / o2 . area ; if ( Math . abs ( o1Density - o2Density ) < 0.00001 ) { return 0 ; } else { return o1Density - o2Density ; } } } and you would use it like this in the Main.java: import java.util.ArrayList ; import java.util.Collections ; import java.util.List ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { List < Country > europe = new ArrayList < Country >(); europe . add ( new Country ( 81903000 , 357121.41 , \"Germany\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 64667000 , 668763 , \"France\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 4985900 , 385199 , \"Norway\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 9514406 , 450295 , \"Sweden\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 47212990 , 504645 , \"Spain\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 8014000 , 41285 , \"Switzerland\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 36371 , 2.02 , \"Monaco\" )); System . out . println ( europe ); Collections . sort ( europe ); System . out . println ( europe ); Collections . sort ( europe , new PopulationDensityComperator ()); System . out . println ( europe ); } } Your output would be: [ Germany: 81903000 , France: 64667000 , Norway: 4985900 , Sweden: 9514406 , Spain: 47212990 , Switzerland: 8014000 , Monaco: 36371 ] [ France: 64667000 , Germany: 81903000 , Monaco: 36371 , Norway: 4985900 , Spain: 47212990 , Sweden: 9514406 , Switzerland: 8014000 ] [ Norway: 4985900 , Sweden: 9514406 , Spain: 47212990 , France: 64667000 , Switzerland: 8014000 , Germany: 81903000 , Monaco: 36371 ] Internal (anonymous) Comparator You can also directly implement the comperator where you need it: import java.util.ArrayList ; import java.util.Collections ; import java.util.Comparator ; import java.util.List ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [] args ) { List < Country > europe = new ArrayList < Country >(); europe . add ( new Country ( 81903000 , 357121.41 , \"Germany\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 64667000 , 668763 , \"France\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 4985900 , 385199 , \"Norway\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 9514406 , 450295 , \"Sweden\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 47212990 , 504645 , \"Spain\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 8014000 , 41285 , \"Switzerland\" )); europe . add ( new Country ( 36371 , 2.02 , \"Monaco\" )); System . out . println ( europe ); Collections . sort ( europe ); System . out . println ( europe ); Collections . sort ( europe , new Comparator < Country >(){ @Override public int compare ( Country o1 , Country o2 ) { double o1Density = o1 . population / o1 . area ; double o2Density = o2 . population / o2 . area ; if ( Math . abs ( o1Density - o2Density ) < 0.00001 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( o1Density > o2Density ) { return 1 ; } else { return - 1 ; } } }); System . out . println ( europe ); } } Your output would be: [ Germany: 81903000 , France: 64667000 , Norway: 4985900 , Sweden: 9514406 , Spain: 47212990 , Switzerland: 8014000 , Monaco: 36371 ] [ France: 64667000 , Germany: 81903000 , Monaco: 36371 , Norway: 4985900 , Spain: 47212990 , Sweden: 9514406 , Switzerland: 8014000 ] [ Norway: 4985900 , Sweden: 9514406 , Spain: 47212990 , France: 64667000 , Switzerland: 8014000 , Germany: 81903000 , Monaco: 36371 ] I don't recommend this way for some reasons: It is more likely that your code gets more difficult to read It's more difficult to reuse your code (you can't use the same Comparator in another location) It's more difficult to extend your code An argument for such an Comparator might be, that it is easier to read. But this is only an argument if the Comparator is very short.

I've just installed Typing Test TQ for testing my typing speed and I wanted to save my results. This wasn't possible, but I could print them. So I thought I could print it to a PDF file and store it this way on my computer. Once again, I didn't think of Microsoft. The Linux-Way How would you solve this problem on a Debian machine? Well, most Debian machines would have a PDF printer pre-installed. So you would simply click on print, choose the PDF printer and be happy. If it is not pre-installed, type: sudo apt-get install cups-pdf Now you can use a PDF printer. Done. It works. The Windows-Way Windows 7 does not have a PDF printer, but it has a \"Microsoft XPS Document Writer\". Lets see what this is: XPS General Information Open XML Paper Specification is an open specification for a page description language and a fixed-document format originally developed by Microsoft as XML Paper Specification (XPS) that was later standardized by Ecma International as international standard ECMA-388. It is an XML-based specification, based on a new print path and a color-managed vector-based document format that supports device independence and resolution independence. OpenXPS was standardized as an open standard document format on June 16, 2009. XPS vs. PDF Comparison of OpenXPS and PDF XPS vs PDF.

The ideal model of circuits does ignore that electrons actually need time to pass the components of the circuit. So we introduced the \"dead time model\". So we added a model component for each real component that does only delay the incoming signal. But I've wondered if dead time of a cable wasn't important, too. So I thought the question would be How fast are electrons moving in a cable? , but I just realized that the question is How fast does a signal move in a wire? . How fast are electrons moving through a wire? If you have electric current \\(I\\) (measured in Ampere), the wire is a cylindric conductore with a cross-sectional area of \\(A\\) , \\(e = -1.6021766 \\cdot 10&#94;{-19} C\\) (coulombs) is the charge of an electron an \\(Q\\) is \\(\\frac{\\text{mobile electrons}}{\\text{volume}}\\) . \\(v = \\frac {I}{QeA}\\) According to this source, \\(Q = 8.5 \\cdot 10&#94;{22} \\frac{1}{cm&#94;3}\\) for copper. If \\(I=1 A\\) and if your wire has a radius of 0.5mm, you get: $v= \\frac{1 A}{ 8.5 \\cdot 10&#94;{22} \\frac{1}{cm&#94;3} \\cdot e \\cdot ((0.5mm)&#94;2 \\cdot pi)} = 9.349 \\cdot 10&#94;{-5} \\frac{m}{s} = $ (see Wolfram|Alpha ). Hmm ... seems to be very slow. Is my calculation correct? How fast are electrical signals moving through a wire? See physics.stackexchange.com \\(v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\mu_r \\varepsilon_r}}\\) where \\(\\varepsilon_r\\) is relative permittivity and \\(\\mu_r\\) is relative magnetic susceptibility . For copper: \\(\\mu_r = 0.999994\\) \\(\\varepsilon_r = 3\\) , as you can't measure permeability of metallic conductors (see \"Elektromagnetische Felder und Wellen\". Paul Lorrain, Dale R. Corson, François Lorrain, page 75) \\(v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{0.999994 \\cdot 3}} = 0.577352 \\cdot c\\) How fast are electrons moving around an atom? Well, first of all I have to mention, that electrons seem not to move around a nucleus as this image suggests: Atom according to Bohrs model A model with atomic orbitals seems to be more accurate. However, you can calulate the speed \\(v\\) an electron would have in Bohrs model. The centripedal force is \\(F_Z = \\frac{m \\cdot v&#94;2}{r}\\) This force pushes the electron away from the nucleus. The coulomb-force is \\(F_C = \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r&#94;2}\\) where \\(\\varepsilon_0 \\approx 8.8541 \\cdot 10&#94;{-12} \\frac{F}{m}\\) is permittivity . Now you calculate: \\begin{align}F_\\mathrm{C} = F_\\mathrm{Z} \\quad &\\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r&#94;2} = \\frac{m_{e}v&#94;2}{r}\\\\ &\\Leftrightarrow \\quad v&#94;2 = \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r m_e} = \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 m_e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} \\end{align} Ok, we're almost there. But how do we get \\(r\\) ? Well, you have to know this equation: \\( m_{e} v r = n \\hbar\\) where \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number and \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck constant . So you get: \\(\\Leftrightarrow r = \\frac{n \\hbar}{v m_e}\\) Now insert this in the equation above: \\begin{align} v&#94;2 &= \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 m_e} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{n \\hbar}{v m_e}}\\\\ \\Rightarrow v &= \\frac{e&#94;2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 n \\hbar} \\end{align} Lets take a hydrogen nucleus ( \\(n=1\\) ): We get \\(2.19 \\cdot 10&#94;6 \\frac{m}{s} \\approx 7.88 \\cdot 10&#94;6 \\frac{km}{h}\\) (see Wolfram|Alpha ). This is much less than 1% of the speed of light (which is \\(1.079 \\cdot 10&#94;9 \\frac{km}{h}\\) ) Sources Very good: How fast do electrons travel in an atomic orbital?

I haven't used them quite often, but I have seen some nice examples. So here are some C++ Preprocessor Snippets: Maximum / Minimum If you want to find the maximum / minimum of two elements, no matter of which type, you can do something like this: #include <iostream> #define MAX(a, b) ((a < b) ? b : a) using namespace std ; int main () { cout << MAX ( 42 , 1337 ) << endl ; cout << MAX ( 1337 , 42 ) << endl ; cout << MAX ( - 1337 , 42 ) << endl ; cout << MAX ( 1337.0 , 42 ) << endl ; return 0 ; } Absolute Value You can get the absolute value like this: #include <iostream> #define ABS(a) (a < 0 ? -(a) : a) using namespace std ; int main () { int a = 42 , b = - 43 , c = 0 , d = - 1337 ; cout << ABS ( a ) << endl ; cout << ABS ( b ) << endl ; cout << ABS ( c ) << endl ; cout << ABS ( d ) << endl ; return 0 ; } By the way, brackets around a are important, because without them you could get: a=1,b=3 ABS(a-b) = ABS(1-3) = (1-3 < 0 ? -1-3 : 1-3) = -2 < 0 ? -4 : -2 = -4 Swap variable content This is an example for a multiline replacement. #include <iostream> #define SWAP(a, b) { int tmp; \\ tmp = b; \\ b = a; \\ a = tmp; \\ } using namespace std ; int main () { int a = 42 , b = 1337 ; swap ( a , b ); cout << a << endl ; cout << b << endl ; return 0 ; } See also Wikipedia: C preprocessor Tips and tricks using the preprocessor: Part one - part two A very good article about the meaning of #import, #error, #pragma.

I would like to know what are the effects of a command I use before I use it - no matter if it is a command line command or a GUI or key-press-combination command. As it is very difficult to make GUI commands unambiguous, I really like the command line for some tasks. Why doesn't Windows offer a default command line that is usable? I mean, yes, you have the PowerShell ... but why isn't it the default shell? Why does the user have to know that there are other (better?) shells? Is there any reason not to use the PowerShell in Windows 7? And even the PowerShell misses some really basic tools. I mean, did you try the path autocompletion (with tab) on bash (the Linux shell)? It completes the path / command, if there is only one possibility. If there are more possibilities, the user gets displayed all options (if there are too many, he will get asked before all are displayed). The Windows-shells go through each possibility. Here are some screenshots of the shells displaying the content of the current folder: Windows32 cmd Windows PowerShell v1.0 Now compare this to Linux: Gnome shell (bash) Where do you find easier what you need? And why do they have a black background with white font color? Try to work with this for some hours and than compare it to a shell with black font size and white background... Missing (command line) tools I like using git / svn from command line. But the default way to use SVN (and eventually GIT) seems to be by GUI. Why results in a crappy, overblown right click menu: Windows right click menu Now compare this to Linux 10.04 with GNOME: Right click menu on GNOME 2 And I should also mention that I didn't clean up my Linux system for over one year. I use it every day, install new software, remove software, forget to remove software. I have git and svn on my Linux machine as well as Apache, Python, some games, ... The Windows 7 machine is a fresh install. It has better hardware and I only use it for work (so it basically only has TurtoiseSVN, Visual Studio and IIS). I guess this would be even worse if I used it every day. Updates Windows makes its updates at very bad times. Sometimes it just makes an update and you have to wait for quarter of an hour to finish it, before you can shut down. Why? Can't you just ask the user before you make an update? A friend of mine had a tutorial after which she wanted to go to a Christmas party. Guess what happened: Before she could shut down the computer, Windows decided to make automatically an update. Took about 15 - 20 minutes. No Christmas parties for Windows users. Automatic shutdown of Windows Windows 7: Automatic update installation Windows really shut down my computer automatically and blocked it for about 15 minutes. What if I had to hold a presentation?

This project is rather fixed for a web project, so we don't suffer from rapid changes (\"rapid\" in terms of other web applications), but nether the less they change. The task seemed to be clear at the beginning, but bit for bit my team of developers discovered details that were not so clear. In this project I have learned that a GUI / prototype driven development can be of great benefit. I assumed this beforehand, but I didn't expect how much it helped. So, I had the idea to create a good GUI to have something to talk about. How do you create a GUI for a web project? HTML is quite simple I know it very well everything I write is obviously possible to realize but the result looks too much like the resulting product. The customer might think that we already have some functional prototype it is also unsatisfying to print HTML pages or screenshots of rendered browser views although HTML is easy, arranging items on a screen might take a while GIMP GIMP was the next option I tried, but its disadvantage is too severe to think seriously about using it for rapid GUI prototyping: It takes ages! A friend of mine helped me out of my misery. He told me of a product called \" Balsamiq \". Balsamiq Balsamiq is easy to use, has a lot of very intuitive features and is able to generate a linked PDF. This means, you can add links to some parts of the interface and simulate interactivity. The user should have opened the slides in full screen, so that on slide fills the screen. Then you might even think it was an web application. Here is an example PDF created with Balsamiq What's great about Balsamiq Balsamiq was carefully designed, is available (and working!) on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 and via browser. The learning curve is very well. I keep finding new features as I need them. So I first intuitively found the most important ones and recognized advanced ones later. Here are two screenshots of the GUI of the Balsamiq web service: Balsamiq GUI overview Do you see the arrow-symbol? This looks very cool in drafts. Why doesn't GIMP provide anything similar?

You can easily find and publish information. It is great for trading as you can search through millions of articles and hundreds of vendors to find the product that fits best to your needs and is as cheap as possible. But recently I get a lot of spam from companies I like ( Amazon , PayPal and Thalia ). I like to get some e-mails from those companies. But how can they provide relevent content instead of spam? When is it good advertising and when does advertising become spam? Intervall of E-mails As a rule of thumb, I would say more e-mails without user-interaction than once a month is spam. So it is perfectly fine if I buy ten products in one week to get ten sales confirmation e-mails. But is not okay to get more than once a month information about the cheapest products, the latest cupons or the latest electronics that I could buy as a present for christmas. Of course, if the user has actively changed the interval of e-mails to once a week or even every day, it is okay to sent him e-mails every day. But this should be opt-in. So the user has to get active to get those e-mails. Easy unsubscribe In every e-mail should be a link to unsubscribe from this type of mail. The user should not have to login first, before he can unsubscribe. So the link has to be randomly generated for every user. Unambiguous sender address Thalia uses the address info@produktnews.thalia.de for sending product news. This is great, because I can create a filter that automatically deletes these e-mails. So although the unsubscribe-link doesn't work, I can get rid of this kind of spam without missing my order confirmations that get sent from info@thalia.de (that should be something like confirmation@thalia.de ) Although Thalia has one address that is clearly only for product information, they didn't solve this problem. They also use thalia@produktnews.thalia.de , what makes it much more difficult for me to filter spam. But it's better than PayPal. They seem to use paypal@e.paypal.de which could have any content.

[5 minutes later] Oh, Microsoft offers some nice-looking information at windows.microsoft.com : Windows 7 editions differences What the #$@&%*!? Why do they write down similarities? I don't want to know what's the same, I want to know the difference! And even the similarities are meaningless. For example Start programs faster and more easily, and quickly find the documents you use most often. If you use comparisons as \"faster\" or \"more easily\" you have to say what you compare. Faster than Vista? Faster than DOS? Faster than Linux? All of those lines are meaningless marketing slang that does not offer any useful peace of information and only wastes time. Result: I have wasted about one hour later, I know that I can't get my system in English without reinstalling it. I have to waste another hour to download it and even one more hour to reinstall it. Linux vs. Windows: 11 minutes of work, nothing to pay vs. 3 hours of work (I got it for free, as I am a student. Otherwise, I might have had to pay about $150). Visual Studio The team I am working with created a diagram on one developers machine. After he had to go, we wanted to continue on another developers machine. So we saved the version and opened it on the other machine. So far so good. After a while we noticed, that we were not able to edit the content of the diagram! The first developer had Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate, the second one \"only\" Visual Studio 2012 Professional. The difference is obvious, isn't it? NO, IT IS NOT! Finally, a little story. Some weeks ago, a prof had some problems showing his slides that were made with Microsoft PowerPoint. The bulled points were showing, but not the text. A friend of mine said: \"The source of this problem is obvious. He certainly does not have PowerPoint Ultimate\" ☺ TL;DR Microsoft creates a lot of different editions for their software. \"Ultimate\" seems to be always the best. Microsoft makes things too complicated, without any reason to do so. This video shows what I mean: I don't understand why a company with that much money, great developers and a lot of user feedback is not able to produce satisfactory, working software.","tags":"Cyberculture","title":"Microsoft product flavor hell"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/creating-gantt-charts/","text":"I am currently involved in a software project and I should create a Gantt chart. So I've searched for tools that allow me to do so, but it was astonishingly difficult to find good tools. I'm not completely content with any of them, but I would like to share my experiences. Gantter Overview Gantter is a free online tool that allows you to create Gantt charts. It looks like this: Overview of Gantter It is easy to use and has a good interface. I can simply define depencies: Gantter Predecessor depency Export Gantter offers some export options: HTML, PDF , PNG , MS-Project (.xml). All export options I've tried are unconvincing. I couldn't save the HTML export, the PDF export was splitted over several pages and the PNG ... well, it's a PNG. As I am currently on a Linux machine, I can't try the MS-Project export. Google Drive Gantter also has a Google Drive integration, but it requests these permissions: Google Drive permissions requested by Gantter I have contacted them today (11.12.2012) and asked why they want these permissions. I'll update this post as soon as I get an answer. My recommendation: Don't give them those rights! You can create an account without a Google Drive permission. GanttProject GanttProject is a Java Gantt chart program (as you might have noticed because of the SWING design): GanttProject - Overview It's quite good, but sometimes I got the feeling that it doesn't instantly response. It's perhaps imagination as I always think that of Java projects. The HTML-export is not so good. It basically converts the chart to an image and embeds this into a HTML page. This is not what I thought of! This way, you can't search or copy the tasks. You also can't see more information about the task. GanttProject export function GNOME Planner Planner is part of GNOME. Planner - Overview This is how you create a new task: Planner: Create a new task It is very annoying that you always have to click on \"Change\", then on \"As soon as possible\" change it to \"fixed date\" and then you can click on a date. Why don't you allow the user to click on a date and when he does, change it automatically to \"fixed date\"? The HTML-export is good, but I would also like to click on a tasks' bar and get the associated task highlighted (and perhaps some additional information). Trac jsGantt plugin You can let Trac automatically create a Gantt chart with Trac jsGantt plugin . According to this link, it should look like this: jsGanttSample I knew that I had to install the MasterTicketsPlugin to make it possible to add ticket dependencies. With that, it looked like this: jsGantt only with MasterTicketsPlugin Not quite what I've expected. So I guess I will also need SubticketsPlugin and TimingAndEstimationPlugin . Update: These Trac-Plugins are crap. The Gantt-Chart that was created looks ugly and doesn't look like I've expected.

Although the result looks very nice, I don't think LaTeX is an optimal solution for Gantt charts of software projects. Yes, you get a great result. But it takes a lot of time and after a week or so this particular chart is definitely outdated. You can't add more information directly as you could do it with HTML tooltips. I don't know if you can produce a linked PDF, but I guess this would be quite a lot of manual work. More tools ProjectLibre was recommended to me, but it is not in the Ubuntu repository ☹ Conclusion LaTeX rulez. If you want nice looking results, you should definitely use LaTeX. Although I think combining an automatically generated Gantt-chart with tickes would be nice, this seems not to be possible by now.","tags":"The Web","title":"Creating Gantt Charts"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/31-bwinf-runde-1-aufgabe-2/","text":"Die Aufgabenstellung Zum Transport von Geld werden schwer bewachte Geldtransporter eingesetzt. In einem solchen Geldtransporter können Koffer mit Münzen transportiert werden. Die Koffer enthalten Münzen in unterschiedlicher Menge und mit unterschiedlichem Gesamtwert.

Es ist daher notwendig, den Transporter gleichmäßig zu beladen, so dass er nicht zu einer Seite umkippen kann. Unser Transporter hat links und rechts je einen Kofferraum. Für jeden Kofferraum lassen sich Gesamtwert und Gesamtgewicht der darin enthaltenen Koffer bestimmen. Damit der Transporter keine Schlagseite bekommt, müssen die Koffer so eingeräumt werden, dass die Differenz zwischen den beiden Gesamtgewichten minimal ist.

Compile time vs. runtime A typical C workflow looks like this: You have an idea, you write your code, you compile it and you run it. C workflow You might make multiple errors. Simple typos or syntax errors are almost always detected at compile time. They are called \"compile time errors\". Others, like the access of an array-index that isn't in the array might only occur sometimes at runtime, depending on the input. Those are runtime errors and they are much more difficult to detect. Additionally, they can not be reproduced that easily as compile time errors can. gdb If you want to find runtime errors, you should deactivate all optimization flags and add debugging symbols. A gcc call might look like this: gcc mySourceFile.c -g This produces a binary file called \"a.out\". Now should run gdb - GNU debug: gdb ./a.out Within the command line program GNU debug you have to enter: run ./a.out You should now be able to see the line in which the runtime-error occurs. valgrind You might want to give valgrind a try.

Ich habe nur ein paar Kleinigkeiten umformuliert und die Formattierung geändert. Mailinglisten-Beitrag Der in der Vorlesung vorgestellte \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) Scheduler [1] wurde vom 2.6er Linux Kernel bis Version 2.6.23 verwendet und dann durch den sogenannten Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) [2] abgelöst, der Rot-Schwarz-Bäume verwendet, und daher in \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))\\) läuft -- dafür aber komplett fair ist ;-) Beide Scheduler wurden von Ingo Molnár entworfen und größtenteils implementiert. Abgesehen von den Wikipedia Artikeln fand ich auch Ingos eigene Beschreibung [3] sehr interessant. In der prä-2.6-Ära des Linux Kernels wurde ein Scheduler verwendet, zu dessen Effizienz ich keine Angaben gefunden habe. Anhand der (ziemlich detaillierten) Beschreibung in Kapitel 10 von „Understanding the Linux Kernel\" [1] gehe ich jedoch davon aus, dass es \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) gewesen sein muss. Auch wenn die dort beschriebenen Algorithmen inzwischen mehrfach überholt sind, fand ich das Kapitel sehr lesenswert. Wie in der Vorlesung vermutet wurde, kann man den Scheduler natürlich konfigurieren. Dazu ist es aber nicht notwendig, neu zu kompilieren -- noch nicht einmal neu zu booten. Stattdessen kann man (beim CFS) einfach über das /proc Dateisystem in die verschiedenen Dateien in /proc/sys/kernel/... schreiben. Die Änderungen werden instantan wirksam. (Und spätestens zum nächsten Reboot wieder zurückgesetzt, man kann also nicht viel kaputt machen.) Permanente Änderungen kann man in /etc/sysctl.conf schreiben. (Habe ich noch nicht probiert.) Ich habe ein kleines Programm geschrieben, das sehr viele Subprozesse erzeugt, die alle sinnlose Rechnungen auf der CPU ausführen und zwischendurch in regelmäßigen Intervallen eine (eigentlich zwei) Zellen auf dem Terminal umfärben. Man kann anhand dessen, wie sich das Muster ändert, schön sehen, wie oft ein einzelner Prozess an die Reihe kommt, und wie lange er es bleibt, wenn er es einmal ist. Das Programm kann von meiner Website heruntergeladen werden. In dem Archiv ist auch ein kleines Shell-Skript, sched-tune.sh , mit dem man die wichtigsten Parameter ändern kann. Die README Datei in dem Archiv erklärt genauer, wie man das Programm benutzen kann. Da der Bildschirm beim Ausführen des Programms (gewollt) stark flackert, muss ich Epileptikern und anderen empfindlichen Personen unter Umständen leider davon abraten. Leider lässt der Kernel keine völlig unsinnigen Werte zu. Man kann also nur bedingt ausprobieren, welchen Einfluss extreme Einstellungen haben / hätten. Wie in Referenz 4 beschrieben, „friert\" die grafische Oberfläche übrigens auch nicht ein, wenn man größere Scheduling Intervalle wählt, da jeder Tastendruck einen Interrupt auslöst, der -- egal wie geschedulet wird -- immer die Kontrolle an jenen Prozess übergibt, der gerade das Keyboard „gegrabbt\" hat.

Ich werde im folgenden mal kurz mögliche Lösungen in Python (und eine in Java) vorstellen. Python hat bei solchen Aufgaben den Vorteil, dass es viel kompakter ist und Ganzzahlen beliebig groß werden können. Händische Lösung Bevor man irgendwas programmiert, sollte man sicherstellen, dass man es testen kann. Was wären also die ersten paar Folgenglieder? \\(a_0 = a_1 = a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 5, a_5 = 9, a_6 = 17, a_7 = 31, a_8 = 57\\) Rekursive Lösung Solche Aufgaben lassen sich häufig sehr einfach rekursiv lösen: def tribonacci ( n ): if n < 3 : return n else : return tribonacci ( n - 1 ) + tribonacci ( n - 2 ) + tribonacci ( n - 3 ) Allerdings hat diese rekursive Lösung den riesigen nachteil, dass viele Berechnungen redundant sind. Angenommen, wir wollen tribonacci(5) berechnen. Dann läuft folgendes ab: Aufruf tribonacci(5) Aufruf tribonacci(4) Aufruf tribonacci(3) Aufruf tribonacci(2) Aufruf tribonacci(1) Aufruf tribonacci(0) Aufruf tribonacci(2) Aufruf tribonacci(1) Aufruf tribonacci(3) Aufruf tribonacci(2) Aufruf tribonacci(1) Aufruf tribonacci(0) Aufruf tribonacci(2) Man sieht deutlich, dass z.B. tribonacci(3) mehrfach berechnet werden muss. Wie kann man so was verbessern? Bottom-Up Ansatz Wir benötigen für ein neues Folgenglied immer nur das vorhergehende. Das kann dann so aussehen: def tribonacciBottomUp ( n ): last = 1 secondLast = 1 thirdLast = 1 for i in range ( 2 , n ): new = last + secondLast + thirdLast thirdLast = secondLast secondLast = last last = new return last Fill it Eine weitere Möglichkeit wäre die schwäche des rekursiven Ansatzes zu eliminieren, indem man alle bisher berechneten Werte in einem Array speichert.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. How many circular primes are there below one million? How to solve If you have heard of the sieve of Eratosthenes, this one sounds quite easy: Find all primes below one million For each prime, do: Generate all rotations Check for every rotation if it is a prime Count the number of circular primes The implementation Sieve of Eratosthenes The finds all primes below \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) . But you can make a lot of mistakes in the implementation. First, this is the way the sieve of Eratosthenes works: Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from prime's square). Source: Wikimedia For example, this implementation is not good: def getPrimesBelowN ( n = 1000000 ): \"\"\" Sieve of Eratosthenes \"\"\" from math import ceil roundUp = lambda n , prime : int ( ceil ( float ( n ) / prime )) primes = range ( 2 , n ) for currentPrime in primes : for multiplicant in xrange ( 2 , roundUp ( n , currentPrime )): noPrime = multiplicant * currentPrime if noPrime in primes : primes . remove ( noPrime ) return primes Whats bad with this code? Well, just think about what it does: For every noPrime Python has to go through the whole list. I couldn't find how in is implemented, but I guess it is linear. So Python has to go through the whole list for in . Additionally, remove could also be expensive. How could this get improved? Here is a better solution: def getPrimesBelowN ( n = 1000000 ): \"\"\" Sieve of Eratosthenes \"\"\" from math import ceil roundUp = lambda n , prime : int ( ceil ( float ( n ) / prime )) primes = [ True ] * n primes [ 0 ] = False primes [ 1 ] = False primeList = [] for currentPrime in xrange ( 2 , n ): if not primes [ currentPrime ]: continue primeList . append ( currentPrime ) for multiplicant in xrange ( 2 , roundUp ( n , currentPrime )): primes [ multiplicant * currentPrime ] = False return primeList This solution does not need to search for noPrime , it simply jumps there in the list. A generator version of the sieve of Erasthostenes can be found on code.activestate.com . isCircularPrime Rotation the digits of a number is the same as cutting the number into two pieces and switching the position of the pieces: def isCircularPrime ( primes , number ): number = str ( number ) for i in xrange ( 0 , len ( number )): rotatedNumber = number [ i : len ( number )] + number [ 0 : i ] if int ( rotatedNumber ) not in primes : return False return True Here is the same problem as above, in the sieving algorithm: Searching through the list takes much more time than jumping to a position in the list. So this one is better: def isCircularPrime ( primes , number ): number = str ( number ) for i in xrange ( 0 , len ( number )): rotatedNumber = number [ i : len ( number )] + number [ 0 : i ] if not primes [ int ( rotatedNumber )]: return False return True Some more speedups Every prime that contains one of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 can't be a circular prime, because one rotation exist where that digit is at the end. This rotation would be divisible by 2 and thus not be a prime (except for 2, of course). You can use the same thought for the digit 5.

Offensichtlich ist, dass die Schaltalgebra mit den Operatoren XOR und AND, also \\((\\{0,1\\}, XOR, AND)\\) ein Körper ist, da Sie offensichtlich isomorph zu \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\) ist. Behauptung: Alle booleschen Algebren mit drei oder mehr Elementen sind keine Körper Beweis: ( danke an Chricho ) Sei \\(\\mathcal{B} = (B, \\sqcap, \\sqcup)\\) mit \\(|B| \\geq 3\\) . Sei \\(a \\in B\\) mit \\(0 \\neq a \\neq 1\\) . Es gilt: \\(\\forall b \\in B: a \\land b \\leq a \\lneq 1 \\Rightarrow a\\) hat kein Inverses \\(\\Rightarrow \\mathcal{B}\\) ist kein Körper \\(\\blacksquare\\) Boolesche Algebren und die Schaltalgebra Die wohl bekannteste boolesche Algebra ist die Schaltalgebra: \\((\\{0,1\\}, \\lor, \\land, 0, 1)\\) Allerdings ist nicht jede Boolesche Algebra eine Schaltalgebra!

Jeder Produktterm \\(K(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\) kann so dargestellt werden, dass eine Variable \\(x\\) in höchstens einem Literal vorkommt. Sei $K(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ ein Produktterm und $y(x_1, \\dots x_n)$ eine boolesche Funktion. $K$ heißt Implikant von $y :\\Leftrightarrow (K \\Rightarrow y)$ Sei $K(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ ein Implikant der boolesche Funktion $y(x_1, \\dots x_n)$. $K$ heißt Minterm von $y :\\Leftrightarrow$ Für jede Variable $x_i$ in $y$ kommt genau ein mal in $K$ als Literal vor. Sei $y(x_1, \\dots x_n)$ eine boolesche Funktion und $x$ ein boolescher Ausdruck, der $y$ entspricht. $x$ heißt disjunktive Normalform (DNF) von $y :\\Leftrightarrow$ $x=\\bigvee_{i=0}&#94;k K_i, \\; k \\leq 2&#94;n - 1:\\quad K_i \\neq K_j \\Leftrightarrow i \\neq j$ Sei $D(x_1, \\dots, x_m)$ eine Disjunktion von Literalen $\\bigvee_{i=1}&#94;m L_i$ oder die Konstante „0\" oder die Konstante „1\".

Today, we have a lot of data that is stored or transferred in a binary way. Once in a while an error occurs and single bits get switched from 0 to 1 or the other way around. Coding theory tries to find algorithms with which you can detect and correct errors. Introduction To keep it simple, we make a small example. We have \\begin{align} \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\} &= \\mathcal{F}_3\\\\ \\{A', B', C', D', E', F', G', H'\\} &\\subsetneq \\mathcal{F}_8 \\end{align} \\begin{align} c_3 = \\{&(1,1,1,1,1,1),\\\\ &(0,0,0,0,1,1),\\\\ &(0,0,1,1,0,0),\\\\ &(0,1,0,1,0,1),\\\\ &(0,1,1,0,1,0),\\\\ &(1,0,0,1,1,0),\\\\ &(1,0,1,0,0,1),\\\\ &(1,1,0,0,0,0)\\} \\end{align} Hamming codes Hamming codes are a family of \\((2&#94;k - 1, 2&#94;{(2&#94;k -1)-k}, 3), \\quad k \\geq 2\\) codes. This means, every hamming code can only correct one error. The idea behind Hamming codes is to save in one bit if the number of a fixed set of positions of the message is even or odd. This is called parity and done with XOR. The parity-bit is saved at the end of the message (or, just another point of view: the positions that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) of each message are only parity bits. This are obviously \\(\\lceil \\log_2(\\text{length of code}) \\rceil = \\lceil \\log(2&#94;k - 1) \\rceil = k\\) ). Wikipedia has a really nice image for that: Parity-bits and data bits in a Hamming codeword Now, how are the parity-bits calculated? Well, think of each messages as a vector in \\(\\{0,1\\}&#94;{(2&#94;k - 1) - k}\\) . Then you define a matrix \\(G \\in \\{0,1\\}&#94;{2&#94;k - 1} \\times \\{0,1\\}&#94;{(2&#94;k - 1) - k}\\) . Now you can get the codewords \\(c\\) by multiplying the datawords \\(d\\) (messages) with \\(G\\) : \\(c = G \\cdot d\\) . This is the reason why Hamming-Codes are called \"linear codes\". They can be obtained by a linear function. How do I get the generator-matrix \\(G\\) ? I don't know it and my internet searches didn't reveal any solution.

[ 1 ] Es werden Rankings in Vorlesungen zitiert und erst vor kurzem wurde von einigen Professoren in der Vorlesung der Verlust des Status der Elite-Universität betrauert. [ 1 ] Ich weiß nicht, was die Kriterien für eine Elite-Uni nach der Exzellenzinitiative sind, aber ich kann mir einige notwendige Voraussetzungen vorstellen, die für mich eine Elite-Uni ausmachen: Lehre Vorlesungen, die anspruchsvollen Stoff gut strukturiert und aufbereitet vermitteln Übungen, die den Stoff vertiefen und eventuell motivieren Tutorien, die offene Fragen beantworten und von kompetenten Tutoren gehalten werden Forschung: Hier kann ich mir nicht anmaßen, gute Kriterien aufstellen zu können, da ich selbst noch nicht daran beteiligt bin. Wirtschaft: vgl. Forschung Damit die Personen, die an Lehre, Forschung und in der Wirtschaft beteiligt sind gut arbeiten können, muss die Organisation reibungsfrei verlaufen. Mir ist klar, dass bei 22.552 Studierenden (Stand: März 2012) nicht immer alles reibungsfrei ablaufen kann. Auch der Bologna-Prozess scheint wohl immer noch Probleme nach sich zu ziehen. Aber für ein paar Probleme, die ich vor kurzem selbst erleben musste, habe ich kein Verständnis. Diese Probleme sind - so scheint es mir - bürokratischer und organisatorischer Natur: Studienbüro Das Studienbüro hat folgende Öffnungszeiten: Mo-Mi: 10:00 - 12:00 Uhr Do: 13:30 - 15:30 Uhr Es hat also in der Woche nur 8 Stunden geöffnet. Ich war heute (Mittwoch) um 9:40 Uhr Studienbüro und es war bereits eine Schlange von ca. 20 Leuten vor der Tür. Als pünktlich um 10:00 Uhr der Eingang geöffnet wurde, reichte die Schlange bereits bis zum gegenüberliegenden Gebäude. Man muss nun beobachten, wie sich das im laufe des Semesters verhält, aber es ist schon ein deutliches Indiz dafür, dass hier entweder Mängel in der Organisation und Struktur des Studiums bzw. der damit verbundenen Software (z.B. QISPOS) vorliegen, oder zu wenig Personal vorhanden ist. Schalter und Schlangen Momentan sind Zettelrollen in verschiedenen Farben aufgestellt. Die Farben sind je nach Studiengang unterschiedlich. Auf jedem Zettel steht eine Nummer und diese wird aufgerufen. Dazu steht eine Frau an der Tür, ruft die Nummer und hält die Tür auf. Ich weiß nicht ob diese Frau noch irgendetwas anderes macht, aber es scheint nicht der Fall zu sein. Wenn sie in dieser Zeit einen weiteren Schalter betreuen würde und das Aufrufen wie bei der Bahn oder im Finanzamt über eine elektronische Anzeige geschehen würde, hätte man vermutlich schon eine Effizienzsteigerung. Die aktuelle Nummer könnte man dann auch über einen Webdienst verfügbar machen, sodass man in der Zwischenzeit auch etwas sinnvolleres machen kann. Nach ein paar Minuten wurde gefragt: \"Gibt es noch irgendjemanden der einen blauen Zettel hat?\". Es gab niemanden. Was passiert dann? Ist eine Arbeitskraft dann untätig, obwohl noch 50 Leute auf Hilfe / Antworten warten? Freundlichkeit und Kompetenz Als ich dann endlich im Studienbüro zu meinem Schalter gekommen bin, konnte ich mein Problem vorstellen. Ich versuche das möglichst wortwörtlich wiederzugeben: Das Modul \"Algorithmen I\" war nicht als bestanden markiert, obwohl ich die Klausur \"Algorithmen I\" bestanden habe, diese auch als bestanden im System stand und es keine weiteren Voraussetzungen gibt. Das habe ich der Angestellten so gesagt. Angestellte: „Da kann ich nichts machen, ich brauche erst ein Formular. Ohne Formular geht da nichts, da müssen sie zu Frau Gheta, ich muss 3 Schalter betreuen und habe dafür keine Zeit.\" Was soll denn das? Ein kurzer Blick ins Modulhandbuch - ich konnte auch sagen an welcher Stelle - ein Blick auf meine Leistungen (die sie bereits aufgerufen hatte) und alles wäre klar geweisen. Also habe ich das Problem nochmals beschrieben Ich: „Ich habe alle Teile des Moduls bestanden, warum ist dann das Modul nicht als bestanden markiert?\" Sie schaut in ihr System und sagt mir, dass ich noch nicht alles aus der Theoretischen Informatik bestanden habe. Warum hat sie plötzlich mit theoretischer Informatik angefangen? Ich habe nichts von Theoretischer Informatik gesagt und mir ist klar, dass ich für das Fach noch nicht alles bestanden habe. Aber das hat doch nichts mit dem Modul zu tun. Obwohl ich die Übungsscheine „Lineare Algebra I\" und „Lineare Algebra II\" für Mathematiker gemacht und bestanden habe, ist nur ein Übungsschein „Lineare Algebra I für die fachrichtung Informatik\" in QISPOS. Also sollte der Übungsschein „Lineare Algebra I für die fachrichtung Informatik\" in „Lineare Algebra I\" umgewandelt werden und der Übungsschein „Lineare Algebra II\" hinzugefügt werden. Ich habe beide Scheine in Papierform, vom Prof. unterschrieben, dabei gehabt und ihr gegeben. Angestellte legt die beiden Übungsschein-Bestätigungen auf einen Ablagestapel Angestellte: „Dafür benötigen sie eine Bestätigung.\" Ich: „Aber ich habe Ihnen doch gerade die Bestätigung gegeben?!?\" Angestellte: „Für eine Ummeldung muss ein anderes Formular ausgefüllt werden. Ich kann so nur die Übungsscheine hinzufügen.\" Na gut, dann habe ich nun wohl einen Übungsschein zu viel ... Nach ein bisschen Diskutieren meint sie, ich hätte wegen HM bereits einen Antrag gemacht. Ich habe niemals HM besucht und hatte bisher auch keine Probleme wegen HM vs. Analysis. Hoffentlich kommt das jetzt nicht dazu ... Insgesamt muss ich sagen, wurde ich unfreundlich behandet - ich hatte das Gefühl, direkt wieder rausgeworfen zu werden - und die Frau hat mir nicht zugehört. Kurz darauf bin ich zum „Servicezentrum für Studium und Lehre\" gegangen. Dort hat mir Frau Metzig geholfen. Sie hat mein Problem verstanden. Nach wenigen Minuten, ohne langes Anstehen oder irgendwelche Formulare hat sie mir versichert, dass Sie sich um das Problem in den nächsten zwei Tagen kümmert. Schon nach 2 Stunden kam eine E-Mail an, in der sie mir mitteilte, dass es ein Systemfehler war. Mein Problem ist nun behoben. QISPOS QISPOS ist ein System von der HIS Hochschul-Informations-System GmbH , das am KIT für die Prüfungsverwaltung eingesetzt wird. Das bedeutet, hier meldet man sich an und ab, kann Noten und bestandene Module nachschauen. Auch Voraussetzungen für andere Module wie z.B. PSE werden hiermit überprüft. Dieses System muss ziemlich schwere Voraussetzungen erfüllen: Es muss funktionieren. Immer. Leider ist das nicht der Fall: Prüfungsanmeldungen klappen nicht. Es werden fehlende Voraussetzungen angezeigt, obwohl es keine Voraussetzungen gibt (ist mir mit Algorithmen passiert) Die Anmeldung für manche Module ist nicht möglich, obwohl sie laut Modulhandbuch möglich ist (z.B. Physiker und Mathe) Sonstige Systemfehler kommen vor: Das Modul Algorithmen wurde bei mir nicht als bestanden markiert, obwohl es offensichtlich bestanden war. Das sind jetzt nur ein paar Fehler, die mir persönlich passiert sind. Es gibt bestimmt noch mehr. Und von unschönen Dingen wie langen Ladezeiten, einer schlechten Menüführung oder einer fehlenden Suchfunktion will ich mal gar nicht reden. Da frage ich mich schon, was das KIT dafür bezahlt. Einfach gesagt, sehe ich zwei Möglichkeiten: Es wird sehr wenig bezahlt: Dann ist es kein Wunder, dass diese Probleme auftreten. Dann sollte man sich überlegen, ob es nicht sinnvoll wäre, mehr zu investieren Man zahlt angemessen / viel für die geforderten Eigenschaften: In diesem Fall sollte man sich nach einem anderem Anbieter umsehen oder selbst eine Entwicklung starten. Ehrlich gesagt wundert es mich, dass es hierfür keine Uni-Eigene Lösung gibt. Gibt es OpenSource in diesem Bereich? Häufige Probleme - FAQ Als ich gewartet habe, sind mir zwei häufige Probleme aufgefallen: Defekte KIT-Card Keine Matrikelnummer Eine defekte KIT-Card sollte einfach über ein Online-Formular nachbestellbar sein. Ich sehe keinen Grund, warum man dazu in das Studienbüro gehen sollte. Wenn jetzt, nach beginn der Vorlesungszeit, noch keine Matrikelnummer vorhanden ist, läuft irgendwas schief. Da es bei vielen der Fall ist, kann es nicht an den Studenten liegen. Entweder wurden bestimmte voraussetzungen nicht deutlich genug gemacht (à la: Es muss Formular XY zurückgeschickt werden, bevor eine Matrikelnummer ausgestellt wird), oder es der Prozess eine Matrikelnummer zu erstellen dauert zu lange. Falls das zu lange dauert, kann man entweder den Prozessablauf beschleunigen, oder mehr Personal einstellen. Eine einfache FAQ-Liste auf der Seite des Studienbüros könnte schon helfen.

Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (kurz: BwInf) begann heute. Das bedeutet, bis zum 03.12.2012 haben Schüler mal wieder die Chance zu zeigen, was sie in der Informatik drauf haben. Es gibt keine verpflichtende Anmeldung, nur die Einsendung. Wenn ihr diesen Beitrag also vor dem 03.12.2012 lest, könnt ihr noch teilnehmen. Die offiziellen Informationen zum Wettbewerb, dessen Ablauf , die Teilnahmebedingungen und die Aufgaben gibt es auf bundeswettbewerb-informatik.de . Das Folgende ist inoffiziell; es sind meine persönlichen Erfahrungen. Ich habe selbst ein paar mal am Bundeswettbewerb teilgenommen und bin bei meiner letzten Teilnahme Bundessieger geworden. Später habe ich Musterlösungen erstellt und an der Korrektur der Erstrunden- und Zweitrundenaufgaben teilgenommen. Ich weiß also wovon ich rede. Aufbau des Wettbewerbs Der BwInf besteht aus drei Runden, in denen algorithmische Probleme gelöst werden müssen. Die ersten beiden Runden werden von zu Hause erledigt. Dafür habt ihr mehr als genug Zeit - jeweils über einen Monat. Die dritte Runde müsst ihr vor Ort bestehen. Diese läuft vollkommen anders ab, aber darüber will ich mal noch nichts berichten. (Falls ihr unbedingt einen Bericht wollt, hier ist der von Tobias ). Nur wer in der ersten Runde mindestens drei von fünf (+ 3 Junioraufgaben) Aufgaben weitgehend richtig gelöst hat, wird zur Zweiten zugelassen. Die Aufgaben der zweiten Runde sind prinzipiell ähnlich aufgebaut, jedoch deutlich schwerer zu lösen. Immer wieder sind \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\) -vollständige Probleme dabei. Warum sollte man teilnehmen? Programmiert ihr gerne? Habt ihr Spaß daran, an Aufgaben zu knobeln? Denkt ihr darüber nach, wie man bereits gelöste Probleme noch effizienter lösen kann? Dann ist der Bundeswettbewerb auf jeden Fall etwas für euch! Selbst wenn ihr nicht alle Fragen überzeugt mit einem „Ja\" beantworten könnt, könnte der Bundeswettbewerb euch gefallen. Probier es einfach mal aus. Einen weiteren Anreitz bieten Preise: Die Bundessieger werden soweit ich weiß immer in die Studienstiftung aufgenommen und es gibt Geldpreise. Und noch ein Schlusswort zur Motivation: Eine gute Dokumentation zu schreiben ist anstrengend. Ich hatte häufig bei der Dokumentation keine Lust mehr, sie noch ein weiteres mal anzusehen. Sie nochmals zu verbessern. Aber die Arbeit lohnt sich. Wenn ihr sie fertig geschrieben habt, könnt ihr stolz darauf sein. Wie ein Sprichwort so schön sagt: „Ohne Fleiß kein Preis.\" Tipps zur Aufgabenbearbeitung Zur Lösungsfindung Wenn ihr ein Skript habt, dass eventuell nicht sofort, aber nach ein paar Stunden die Lösung ausgeben sollte, dann vergesst nicht, auch eine Ausgabe mit Zwischenergebnissen dafür einzubauen! Kaum etwas ist ärgerlicher, als ein Programm, das lange läuft und am Ende keine Ausgabe macht oder sich aufhängt. Doku ist wichtig Bei der Korrektur wird zuerst die Dokumentation angesehen. Natürlich ist die Lösungsidee wichtig, aber eine negativ bewertete Dokumentation ist ärgerlich. Also lest euch bitte die Dokumentation nochmals durch und überprüft, ob die wichtigen Lösungsideen verständlich erklärt wurden. Ich denke das ist wohl der einzige Aspekt, wo euch andere helfen können. Gerade Leute ohne Programmierkenntnis sollten eure Lösungsidee verstehen können. Mein Vater (der nicht programmieren kann) hat häufig meine Einseundungen nochmals auf Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehler sowie auf fehlende Zusammenhänge überprüft. Er konnte zwar nicht sagen, was dort nicht stimmt, hat aber häufig ... naja, sagen wir mal Stellen gefunden, bei denen meine Deutschlehrer wohl Zahnschmerzen hätten (trifft wohl auch auf diesen Blog zu ;-) ) Also: Schreibt die Doku früh. Ich habe sie geschrieben, während ich programmiert habe. Dann setzt irgendwann eine Version auf, von der ihr denkt, dass sie fertig ist. Wartet so ein, zwei Tage und lest sie euch nochmals durch (es ist wirklich erstaunlich, was man dann sieht). Dann sucht euch jemanden, der die Aufgabenstellung nicht kennt und nicht programmieren kann. Der Korrekturleser sollte das Deutsche natürlich gut beherrschen. So ein Korrekturleser streicht nur mangelhafte Stellen in eurer endgültigen Version an, macht aber keine Verbesserungsvorschläge. Die müsst ihr euch selbst überlegen. Und dann ist man wirklich froh, wenn man das blöde Ding los ist. Eine Randbemerkung dazu noch: Ich habe mal einen kurzen Job als Programmierer für ein größeres Projekt übernommen. Dabei gab es über 2GB, die größtenteils C++-Code und ein paar Testdaten waren (rechnet es aus, das ist VERDAMMT viel Code!). Die hatten keine Dokumentation! Ich habe bestimmt eine Woche nur damit verbracht, mich mehr oder weniger wahllos durch wirre Quelltexte zu klicken, weil ich noch nicht einmal wusse, wo ich genau anfangen soll. Ich glaube den Zweck einer Dokumentation versteht man erst nach einem solchem Erlebnis. Beispiele Die Beispiele werden leider hin und wieder vergessen und sind oft nicht aussagekräftig. Überlegt euch: Welche Eingaben sind Standard-Fälle? Welche Eingaben sind Sonderfälle? Diese sollten unbedingt als Beispiele gezeigt werden, da es oft nicht klar ist, ob jemand in einer Einsendung daran gedacht hat. Mit Sonderfällen sind nicht falsche Eingaben gemeint - das ist für den Bundeswettbewerb unwichtig - sondern korrekt formatierte Eingaben, die etwas ungewöhnliches / schweres aufweisen. Die Beispiele sollen euch helfen, Probleme zu entdecken. Eventuell funktioniert eure Implementierung nicht so, wie ihr es euch vorstellt. Das könnt ihr damit feststellen. In diesem Zusammenhang solltet ihr euch das Konzept der testgetriebenen Entwicklung ansehen. Dabei schreibt man zuerst alle wichtigen Testfälle, bevor man überhaupt eine Zeile produktiven Codes schreibt. Beispielsweise für die Aufgabe „Verben\" würde ich heute so eine Herangehensweise wählen. Ach ja: Es kann sein, dass ihr ein Problem feststellt, dieses aber nicht beheben könnt. Dann solltet ihr es beschreiben. Es wird sowieso entdeckt. Man kann eurer Lösungsidee erkennen, welche schwächen die Implementierung hat. Versionskontrolle Ich habe leider erst nach dem Bundeswettbewerb meine ersten Erfahrungen mit Versionskontrollsystemen gesammelt. Immer wenn ich eine Idee hatte, wie man das Problem anders angehen könnte, habe ich eine Kopie der aktuellen Version erstellt und auf der Kopie weiter gearbeitet. Diese Lösung ist jedoch in vielerlei Hinsicht einem Versionskontrollsystem - SVN und Git sind die bekanntesten - unterlegen. Man kann nicht so leicht eine Sicherung durchführen. Es ist unübersichtlich, die wiederherstellung bei vielen Dateien ist schwer und man kann sich nicht so leicht die Unterschiede von verschiedenen Versionen anzeigen lassen. Zum vergleich: Hier kann man sich den Unterschied zweier Versionen auf code.google.com ansehen. Mit meld bekommt man ähnlich gute Ergebnisse auch auf dem eigenem Rechner. LaTeX LaTeX ist toll - aber keine Pflicht. Es werden leider relativ wenige Dokumentationen mit LaTeX erstellt. Dabei bietet LaTeX für den BwInf ein paar Vorteile: Das Ergebnis kann sich sehen lassen, LaTeX sieht einfach schön aus. Man kann die Doku in die Versionskontrolle stecken. Man kann Quelltext automatisch einbinden lassen (siehe dazu ein Blogpost von mir). Und so bekommt man LaTeX: How to install the latest LaTeX Version . Außerdem ist die Kombination LaTeX+Versionskontrolle toll ☺ Die CD Ich weiß leider nicht, warum keine Online-Abgabe möglich ist. Vielleicht, weil es einfacher ist. Eventuell aus Sicherheitsgründen. Wenn man Papier und eine CD in der Hand hat, kann es nicht passieren, dass eine Runde im schlimmsten Szenario komplett ausfallen muss, weil der Server abgeraucht ist. Egal wie, ihr müsst die CD erstellen. Dazu hätte ich - aus Sicht eines Korrektors - ein paar Bitten: Die CD hat über 600 MB. Das ist deutlich mehr, als ihr braucht. Also schreibt doch bitte auch die Beispiele des BwInf darauf, sowie eine PDF-Datei eurer Doku. Das erleichtert die Korrektur ungemein, da man so die Doku durchsuchen kann. Überprüft, ob die CD auch wirklich gebrannt wurde, abgeschlossen wurde und sie lesbar ist. Wenn eure Dokumentation schlecht ist und die CD nicht lesbar ist, kann eventuell eine gute Lösungsidee schlecht bewertet werden. edit: Hier habe ich eine Rückmeldung von Herrn Dr. Pohl erhalten. Es geht nicht um CD vs. Online-Abgabe sondern um CD und „gedruckte Dokumentation und CD\" vs. „Online-Abgabe\". Die Korrektur von Lösungsideen auf einem Blatt Papier ist immer noch die einfachste und für den Leser die angenehmste. Ich schreibe als Korrektor häufig Anmerkungen in eure Dokumentation, damit der Zweitkorrektor leichter nachvollziehen kann, was ich mangelhaft oder auch sehr gut gefunden habe. Außerdem schreibe ich manchmal rein, was der Einsender gemeint hat (falls die Doku nicht so toll war und es nicht direkt ersichtlich ist). Außerdem ist es mit CDs einfacher, die Infrastruktur für die Korrektur aufzubauen. An den Bewertungswochenenden werden so ca. 30 frisch aufgesetzte, unvernetzte PCs benutzt (es lohnt sich also nicht, Viren zu schreiben). Bei einer Online-Abgabe müssten diese PCs Internet haben, was leider nicht immer zur Verfügung steht. Oder sie müssten lokal, z.B. auf einem NAS, sein. Das ist alles etwas umständlicher als einfach eine CD zu brennen. Ihr dürft übrigens auch SD-Karten einschicken ☺ Vielen Dank an Herrn Dr. Pohl für die Hinweise! Die Programmiersprache Also eine Brainfuck -Einsendung muss jetzt nicht gerade sein (obwohl ich wirklich beeindruckt wäre). Aber eine Shakespeare -Einsendung würde ich mal toll finden ☺ Nein, im ernst: Ihr dürft fast alles benutzen. Ich selbst kann Python, PHP, Java, C++ und C gut genug um jede Einsendung verstehen zu können. Ich weiß, dass wir immer Leute haben die Haskel/Objective CAML und vielleicht noch ein paar weitere funktionale Sprachen können. Auch Pascal, Delphi (Object Pascal), BASIC stellen kein Problem dar. Das ist jetzt keine vollständige Liste; unter den Korrektoren gibt es einige, die auch exotische Sprachen können. Aber wenn euch klar ist, dass eure Sprache exotisch ist, dann solltet ihr besondere Sprachfeatures kommentieren. Ich habe damals meine Einsendung in PHP geschrieben, später in Python. Warum PHP? Naja, es gibt ein super Tutorial für PHP . Welche Programmiersprache würde ich heute nehmen? Nun, es gibt keine Programmiersprache die für jeden Zweck gut ist. Für kleine Probleme - und Bundeswettbewerbsaufgaben sind zwar schwer, aber doch recht übersichtlich - eignet sich häufig Python gut. Falls es in der zweiten Runde auf Geschwindigkeit ankommt, ist wohl C++ eine Sprache der Wahl. Für später empfiehlt es sich, Java zu lernen. Aber ihr müsst keine dieser Sprachen nehmen. Das ist ja das tolle am BwInf. Es steht euch frei, das zu wählen, was für euch das beste ist. Quelltext-Kommentare Trotz Doku sind Quelltextkommentare erwünscht. Allerdings müssen Standard-Strukturen (if/else,for,while, Variablendeklarationen) nicht kommentiert werden! Übertreibt es nicht, aber verwendet Kommentare, wenn einem Außenstehendem nicht direkt klar sein kann, was ihr macht. Java-Programmierer sollten definitiv die standard Sun Checkstyle und JavaDoc verwenden, Python-Programmierer sollten DocStrings kennen und verwenden. Für alle anderen Sprachen muss man halt ein Gefühl entwickeln. Wer in C wild mit Pointern um sich wirft sollte tendenziell wohl mehr Kommentare machen als jemand, der Pythons Standardbefehle nutzt. Style-Guides Es ist nicht zwingend erforderlich, dass ihr euch an sogenannte Styel-Guides haltet. Allerdings ist es bei der Bewertung - und insbesondere später, wenn ihr an echten Projekten mit anderen zusammen arbeitet - sehr hilfreich, wenn ihr euch an Konventionen haltet. Hier sind ein paar: C++ : von Google Java : Google oder Oracle Python : PEP8 , Online-Checker , NumpyDoc Was sollte man lernen? Falls ihr Informatik studieren wollt oder später programmieren wollt, sind SVN und GIT unverzichtbar. Außerdem werdet ihr wohl mit Java und C++ in Kontakt kommen. Am KIT wird euch beigebracht, wie ihr mit Eclipse und checkstyle umgeht. Aber es wird auch erwartet, dass ihr es nutzt. Ich vermute, dass für viele wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen im Natur- und Ingenieurswissenschaftlichen Bereich LaTeX kaum wegzudenken ist. (Ach ja: Ihr könnt auch Briefe mit LaTeX schreiben und komplexe Grafiken mit LaTeX erstellen !) Website-Empfehlungen Das meiste, was ihr wissen müsst, könnt ihr über Wikipedia lernen. Ich habe mich z.B. mal durch die Kategorie:Algorithmus geklickt. Das ist nicht sonderlich zielführend und sicher nicht jedermanns Sache, aber so habe ich mir einiges beigebracht. Ob es mir viel genutzt hat, kann ich nur schwer beurteilen. Wenn ihr Interessantes rund um die praktische Informatik in kleinen Portionen lernen wollt, ist der Newsletter von StackOverflow.com empfehlenswert. Der ist zwar auf englisch, aber ich glaube das Englisch ist einfach genug. Außerdem werdet ihr im Informatik-Bereich häufig auf englische Literatur, Websites, Manuals oder Spezifikationen treffen. Man muss sich vielleicht mal daran gewöhnen, mit leo einiges Übersetzen, aber das gibt sich schnell. Es gibt übrigens von einigen Universitäten Online-Vorlesungen. Ich habe mir damals eine Vorlesung vom MIT komplett angesehen (das waren damals zwei Dozenten, von denen einer Prof. John Guttag war). Dieses Semester habe ich vom Stanford Algorithms: Design and Analysis durchgearbeitet. Die stellen sogar eine PDF-Urkunde mit deinen Ergebnissen aus. Udacity bietet in der Hinsicht auch interessante Kurse. Wenn ihr generell am Knobeln Spaß habt, kann ich sogenannte „ Challenge Websites \" empfehlen. Die Probleme sind (größtenteils) schneller zu lösen als beim Bundeswettbewerb und man muss keine Doku schreiben. Buchempfehlungen Für die zweite Runde kann ich „Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness\" ( Link ) empfehlen. Es wird in der zweiten Runde häufig (immer?) erwartet, dass man auf die Komplexität des Problems bzw. das Laufzeitverhalten der eigenen Lösung eingeht. Wenn man das besonders gut macht, gibt es hin und wieder Bonuspunkte. Wenn ihr dieses Buch - das ganz eindeutig dem Bereich der Theoretischen Informatik zuzuordnen ist und für einen Schüler bestimmt keine leichte Lektüre ist - versteht und das Wissen übertragen könnt, dann könntet ihr hier Boni erhalten. Aber wie gesagt, das zu verstehen und auf ein konkretes Problem zu übertragen ist nicht leicht. Deutlich einfacher ist „Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst\". Das Buch gibt eine grundlegende Einleitung und ist auf deutsch. Und, nur um es nochmals zu betonen: Das sind persönliche Erfahrungen und teilweise Bitten von jemanden, der es korrigiert. Wenn Teilnehmer meine Tipps nicht beachten, gibt es keinen Punktabzug und es gibt auch keine Bonuspunkte, wenn ihr sie beachtet. Aber ihr erleichtert ein paar Leuten die Korrektur, ihr lernt dabei eventuell was neues (LaTeX und GIT/SVN werdet ihr im Informatik-Studium noch benötigen) und vielleicht fallen euch Fehler oder Mängel in eurer Lösung auf. Falls ihr Fragen habt kann ich die auch gerne beantworten. Auf Ikhaya habe ich bereits ein paar beantwortet.

And I recently started to create images with LaTeX / TikZ. Today, I've found this image in the article about the Intermediate value theorem: Pixel-image of a function from Wikipedia Get special points As a first step, you should open the image with GIMP (or any other editor of your choice) and find the pixel-coordinates of special points: Cubic function in GIMP This function has a maximum at (123 | 105) and a minimum at (172 | 218) ... well, thats not correct. Note that the axis of GIMP starts at the upper left. So the y-axis is wrong. I have cropped and flipped the image vertically. Now you can read the minimum / maximum coordinates with GIMP: Cubic function cropped and flipped vertically The local maximum is at (79 | 133) and the local minimum is at (131 | 20). Form equations A cubic function generally looks like this: \\(f(x) = a \\cdot x&#94;3 + b \\cdot x&#94;2 + c \\cdot x + d\\) You have two points, so they have to fit to this equation: (I) \\(f(79) = 133\\) (II) \\(f(131) = 20\\) The derivative has to be zero in a minimum and a maximum, so you know two more equations: (III) \\(f'(79) = 0\\) (IV) \\(f'(131) = 0\\) Four linear equations and four variables. Now we can solve those equations. Get explicit equations As a first step, we write down the equations in an explicit form. You have to know the general derivate of a cubic function: \\(f'(x) = 3 a\\cdot x&#94;2 + 2 b \\cdot x + c\\) (I) \\(493039a + 6241b+79c + d = 133\\) (II) \\(2352637a + 17689b + 131c + d = 20\\) (III) \\(18723a + 158 b + c = 0\\) (IV) \\(51483 a + 262 b + c = 0\\) Solve the equations Now you have to solve the equations. I took Wolfram|Alpha , because the numbers are really ugly. If you like to do it by hand, you have to know how to use the Gaussian algorithm .

In diesem Fall heißt a der Grenzwert von $(a_n)$ und man schreibt: $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (a_n) = a$. Ist $(a_n)$ nicht konvergent, so heißt $(a_n)$ divergent . Ich werde im Folgendem ein paar wichtige Hinweise geben, wie man konvergenz oder gegebenenfalls divergenz zeigen kann. Wichtige Folgen Konvergent \\(\\displaystyle e := \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}(1+\\frac{1}{n})&#94;n = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{k=0}&#94;n \\frac{1}{n!}\\) . \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0\\) . \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{c} = 1\\) , mit \\(c > 0\\) . \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{n} = 1\\) .

Beachte : Ich habe nicht die größte untere Schranke gewählt. Hatte ich das gemacht (und bewiesen, dass es keine größere untere Schranke gibt), dann hätte ich sogar den Grenzwert bestimmt. Cauchy-Folgen In Banachräumen kann man auch nachweisen, dass eine Folge eine Cauchy-Folge ist um Konvergenz zu zeigen. Sie muss dazu dieser Bedingung genügen: \\(\\forall_{\\varepsilon > 0} \\exists_{n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}}: \\forall_{n,m\\in\\mathbb{N}, n>n_0, m>n_0}: |a_m- a_n| < \\varepsilon\\) Beispiel: Mir fällt gerade kein Beispiel ein, bei dem man die Konvergenz schöner über das Cauchy-Kriterium zeigen kann als über die Beschränktheit / Monotonie. Falls dir eines einfällt, kannst du es ja in den Kommentar schreiben. (mit [latex] \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} 123 [/latex] wird es auch als LaTeX dargestellt ;-)) Weiteres Bei Polynomen darf man den \"Ausklammer-Trick\" nicht vergessen: \\(a_n = \\frac{3 \\cdot n&#94;5 + 2 \\cdot n&#94;2 + 42}{1000 \\cdot n&#94;5 + n&#94;3} = \\frac{n&#94;5}{n&#94;5} \\cdot \\frac{3 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n&#94;3} + 42 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n&#94;5}}{1000 + \\frac{1}{n&#94;2}}= \\frac{3 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n&#94;3} + 42 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n&#94;5}}{1000 + \\frac{1}{n&#94;2}}\\) Das sieht zwar deutlich schlimmer aus als vorher, ist aber besser.

Dabei wird hier eine Jordansche Normalform erzeugt, bei der die 1er auf der oberen Nebendiagonale sind und die größten Jordankästchen zuerst kommen. Ich werde hier nicht erklären, warum es so funktioniert. Hier sind zwei Beispiele mit 2x2-Matrizen und Beispiele mit 4x4-Matrizen . Gegeben sei eine Matrix \\(A \\in \\mathbb{C}&#94;{n \\times n}\\) . Berechnung der Jordanschen Normalform Charakteristisches Polynom bestimmen Als ersten Schritt muss man das charakteristische Polynom \\(p_A(\\lambda)\\) der Matrix \\(A\\) bestimmen. → Wie berechnet man das charakteristische Polynom? Zerlegung in Linearfaktoren Die Zerlegung des charakteristischen Polynoms \\(p_A(\\lambda)\\) in Linearfaktoren kann ziemlich schwer sein. Dafür muss man unbedingt die Mitternachtsformel \\(\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b&#94;2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) können und eventuell wissen, wie eine Polynomdivision funktioniert. Eventuell muss man dazu auch Nullstellen erraten. Wenn es ums raten geht, würde ich folgendes ausprobieren: 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3. Sobald man diese Zerlegung hat, kann man die Eigenwerte und die algebraische Vielfachheit der Eigenwerte direkt ablesen. Die Eigenwerte stehen in der Jordanmatrix auf der Diagonalen. Die algebraische Vielfachheit entspricht der Seitenlänge des quadratischen Jordanblocks. Anzahl der Jordankästchen bestimmen Jeder Eigenwert hat genau einen Jordanblock. Jeder Jordanblock hat wiederum Jordankästchen. Das sieht so aus: ( J = \\left( \\begin{array}{*4{c}} A_{\\lambda_1} & & & 0\\\\ & A_{\\lambda_2} & & \\\\ & & \\ddots & \\\\ 0 & & & A_{\\lambda_k} \\end{array} \\right)) \\(A_{\\lambda_i}\\) sind die Jordanblöcke zu den Eigenwerten \\(\\lambda_i\\) . Die Einzelnen Jordanblöcke schauen etwa so aus: Einzelner Jordanblock mit zwei hervorgehobenen Jordankästchen Jedes Jordankästchen ist quadratisch, hat auf der Diagonalen den Eigenwert und auf der oberen Nebendiagonale 1er. Sonst sind nur 0er im Jordankästchen. Außerhalb der Jordankästchen sind im Jordanblock nur 0er. Insbesondere können also auf der oberen Nebendiagonalen des Jordanblocks 0er stehen! Es gilt: \\(\\text{geometrische Vielfachheit des Eigenwertes } \\lambda := \\dim E_\\lambda \\leq \\text{algebraische Vielfachheit des Eigenwertes } \\lambda\\) \\(\\dim E_\\lambda = \\dim \\text{Kern}(A - \\lambda \\cdot I) = \\text{Anzahl der Jordankästchen im Jordanblock zu } \\lambda\\) → Wie bestimme ich den Kern einer linearen Abbildung? Außerdem gilt: Die Größe des größten Jordankästchens zum Eigenwert \\(\\lambda_i\\) ist gleich der Potenz, mit der der Linearfaktor \\((x-\\lambda_i)\\) im Minimalpolynom (leider NICHT das charakteristische Polynom ☹ ) vorkommt. Nun kann man häufig schon schlussfolgern, welche Größe die einzelnen Jordankästchen haben. Zusätzlich haben ähnliche Matrizen die gleiche Spur, die gleiche Determinante und den gleichen Rang. Das könnte helfen um \"falsche\" Jordanmatrizen auszuschließen. Damit ist die Jordansche Normalform der Matrix häufig schon bestimmt. Größe der Jordankästchen bestimmen Sei \\(\\Omega = \\Phi - \\lambda \\cdot id\\) und \\(K_k = \\text{Kern } ((\\Omega)&#94;k)\\) Man wähle \\(q \\in N&#94;+\\) so, dass \\(\\dim K_q = \\dim K_{q+1} = \\dim K_{q+2} = ... = \\dim V\\) und q minimal. Dann gilt: q ist die länge des größten Jordankästchens in dem Jordanblock (und außerdem der Exponent im Minimalpolynom zum betrachteten Eigenwert \\(\\lambda\\) ). Es sei \\(a_0 = \\dim K_0 = 0, a_1 = \\dim K_1, a_i = \\dim K_i\\) mit \\(i \\in 0, ..., q\\) .

Es ist die invertierbare Matrix S, für die gilt: \\(A = S \\cdot J \\cdot S&#94;{-1}\\) Kerne bestimmen Bestimme \\(K_1, K_2, K_3, ... , K_q\\) , wobei \\(\\dim K_{q-1} < \\dim K_q = \\dim K_{q+1} = \\dim K_{q+2} ...\\) gilt. Man kann also bei \\(K_q\\) aufhören. Für jedes \\(K_k\\) mit \\(k \\in 1, ..., q\\) bestimmt man eine möglichst einfache Basis. Zusammensetzen An dieser Stelle sollte man wissen, wie groß die Jordankästchen sind. Für ein Jordankästchen der Größe \\(i\\) wählt man einen Basisvektor \\(v_i\\) aus \\(K_i\\) , der jedoch nicht in \\(K_{i-1}\\) liegt. Die restlichen \\(i-1\\) Vektoren für dieses Kästchen erhält man, indem man die Abbildungsmatrix von \\(\\Omega&#94;{j}\\) , mit \\(j = 1, ..., i-1\\) , mit \\(v_i\\) multipliziert. Also: \\(v_j = (A - \\lambda \\cdot E)&#94;{i-j}\\) mit \\(j = 1, ..., i\\) Die Vektoren \\(v_j\\) schreibt man mit aufsteigenden Indizes in die geordete Basis. Beachte: Man wählt nur den Vektor \\(v_i\\) , alle anderen Vektoren für dieses Kästchen sind dadurch festgelegt! Außerdem schreibt man \\(v_i\\) erst am Ende in die Basis! Inverse Matrix bestimmen Sobald man \\(S\\) bestimmt hat, muss man nur noch das Inverse davon bestimmen: → Wie bestimme ich das Inverse einer Matrix? Interessante Eigenschaften der JNF Im Zusammenhang mit der JNF (und einigen Klausuraufgaben) sind mir ein paar erwähnenswerte Eigenschaften aufgefallen: Die Anzahl der Jordankästchen zum Eigenwert \\(\\lambda = 0\\) ist \\(n - \\text{Rang}(A)\\) . Begründung : Die Anzahl der Jordankästchen zum Eigenwert \\(\\lambda\\) ist gleich der Dimension des Eigenraumes von \\(\\lambda\\) . Der Eigenraum zum Eigenwert 0 hat die besonderheit, dass es der Kern ist. Nach der Dimensionsformel gilt: \\(\\dim \\text{Kern}(\\Phi) + \\dim \\text{Bild}(\\Phi) = n = \\dim \\text{Kern} + \\text{ Rang}(A_\\Phi)\\) .","tags":"German posts","title":"Wie berechnet man die Jordan'sche Normalform?"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/java-puzzle-10-multiple-interfaces/","text":"You have to following source code: A.java : public interface A { public int methodA ( double a , int b , char c ); public int methodB (); } B.java : public interface B { public int methodB (); public void methodC (); } test.java : public class test implements A , B { public static void main ( String [] args ) { test t = new test (); System . out . println ( t . methodA ( 1 , 2 , '3' )); System . out . println ( t . methodB ()); t . methodC (); } @Override public int methodA ( double a , int b , char c ) { return 42 ; } @Override public int methodB () { return 1337 ; } @Override public void methodC () { System . out . println ( \"methodC executed.\" ); } } What is the output?

Nachdem er das Spiel verloren hat, ist der Kaiser großzügig und will dem Bauern jeden Wunsch erfüllen. Der Bauer gibt sich bescheiden und verlangt für das erste Schachfeld ein Reiskorn, für das zweite zwei Reiskörner, usw. Allgemein formuliert verlangt er für jedes Schachfeld doppelt so viele Reiskörner wie für das Vorhergehende. Wieviel Reis muss der Kaiser von China abtreten? Lösung Ein Schachbrett hat \\(8 \\cdot 8 = 64\\) Felder. Für das \\(i\\) -te Feld, \\(1 \\le i \\le 64\\) , muss der Kaiser \\(2&#94;{i-1}\\) Reiskörner abgeben. Insgesamt muss er also \\(\\sum_{i=1}&#94;{64} 2&#94;{i-1}\\) Reiskörner abgeben. Das sind \\(2&#94;{64} - 1 = 18446744073709551615 \\approx 1{,}84 \\cdot 10&#94;{19}\\) Reiskörner. Vergleiche Wie viel sind 18.446.744.073.709.551.615 Reiskörner? Erdabdeckung Würde man die Erde gleichmäßig mit Reiskörnern abdecken, wie hoch wäre diese Schicht? Die Erde hat eine Oberfläche von ca. 510 Millionen \\(\\text{km}&#94;2\\) , ein Basmati-Reiskorn ist ca 6,5 mm lang, hat einen Durchmesser von ca. 1,5 mm und hat vereinfacht eine Kreiszylinderform. Daraus ergibt sich folgende Gleichung, bei der \\(x\\) die Höhe der Reisschicht ist: $ \\begin{align} x \\cdot A_{Erde} &= (2&#94;{64}-1) \\cdot 6,5\\text{mm} \\cdot (1,5\\text{mm})&#94;2 \\cdot \\pi \\\\ x &= \\frac{(2&#94;{64}-1) \\cdot 6,5\\text{mm} \\cdot (1,5\\text{mm})&#94;2 \\cdot \\pi}{A_{Erde}} \\\\ x &= \\frac{(2&#94;{64}-1) \\cdot 45,9458\\text{mm}&#94;3}{510 \\cdot 10&#94;6 \\cdot 10&#94;{12} \\text{mm}&#94;2} \\\\ x &= \\frac{8,47550 \\cdot 10&#94;{20} \\text{mm}&#94;3}{510 \\cdot 10&#94;{18} \\text{mm}&#94;2} \\\\ x &= 1,662\\text{mm} \\end{align} $ Die Erde könnte also komplett mit ca. 1,662 mm Reis, also etwas mehr als einem Reiskorn, bedeckt werden. Reispackungen Den vorhergehenden Vergleich finde ich noch etwas unpraktisch. Wieviele Reispackungen wären das? Eine handelsübliche Packung Reis beinhaltet ca. 1 kg Reis. Ein Reiskorn wiegt ca. 65 mg. $ \\begin{align} x &:= \\text{Reispackungen} \\\\ x \\cdot 1\\text{kg} &= 65\\text{mg} \\cdot (2&#94;{64}-1) \\\\ x \\cdot 10&#94;6\\text{mg} &= 1199038364791120854975\\text{mg} \\\\ x &\\approx 1,2 \\cdot 10&#94;{15} \\end{align} $ Reispackungen pro Person Auch \\(1,2 \\cdot 10&#94;{15}\\) ist noch zu groß, um sich etwas darunter vorstellen zu können.

Rechenweg \\begin{align} x &= \\text{Umfang} \\cdot \\frac{\\varphi}{360&#94;\\circ} \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot r \\cdot \\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{r}{r+h})}{360&#94;\\circ} \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot 6370 \\text{km} \\cdot \\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{6370}{6370,83})}{360&#94;\\circ} \\\\ &= 102,8 \\text{km} \\end{align} Antwort Bei optimalen, also unrealistischen, Bedingungen könnte man die Spitze des Burdsch Chalifa noch in 102,8 km entfernung sehen. Dies entspricht übrigens auch dem Punkt auf der Erdoberfläche, der vom Burdsch Chalifa am weitesten entfernt und zu sehen ist. Auch wenn nur die Luftlinie gemessen wird, sind es 102,8 km, da der Erdradius bedeutend größer als der Burdsch Chalifa ist. Laut Bildzeitung kann man die Spitze des Burdsch Chalifa noch in 95 km sehen. Erweiterung der Aufgabenstellung Das Dorf Mileiha liegt direkt östlich vom Burdsch Chalifa (25° 11' 50'' N, 55° 16' 27'' O). Wie weit östlich darf das Dorf maximal liegen, damit man die Spitze des Burdsch Chalifa bei optimalen Bedingungen noch sehen kann? Hinweis: Es gelten noch immer die gleichen Voraussetzungen wie im ersten Teil der Aufgabe. Situationsskizze Gesucht ist die grün eingezeichnete Kurve, die sich über die Erdoberfläche krümmt. Ihre Länge sei x. Um diese zu berechnen, müssen wir wissen welchen Radius die Kreisfläche hat, die entsteht, wenn man die Erde am 25. Breitengrad schneidet. Der Radius dieser Kreisfläche sei \\(r_{25}\\) . Berechnung $ \\begin{align} \\text{Breitengrad} &= 25 + \\frac{11}{60} + \\frac{50}{60 \\cdot 60} \\\\ \\text{Breitengrad} &= \\frac{9071}{360} \\approx 25,1972 \\\\ \\cos(\\frac{9071}{360}) &= \\frac{r_{25,1972}}{6370\\text{km}} \\\\ r_{25,1972} &= \\cos(\\frac{9071}{360}) \\cdot 6370\\text{km} \\\\ r_{25,1972} &\\approx 5764\\text{km} \\end{align} $ Der soeben errechnete Radius kann einfach in die im ersten Abschnitt erarbeitete Formel eingesetzt werden: $ \\begin{align} x &= 2 \\cdot r \\cdot \\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{r}{r+h})}{360&#94;\\circ} \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot 5764 \\text{km} \\cdot \\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{5764}{5764,83})}{360&#94;\\circ} \\\\ &\\approx 97,8 \\text{km} \\end{align} $ Nun sollte man noch berücksichtigen, dass die Beobachter wohl nicht auf der Erde kriechen, sondern ihre Augen in einer Höhe von ca. 1,6m sind: $ \\begin{align} x &= 2 \\cdot 5764 \\text{km} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{360&#94;\\circ} \\cdot ( \\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{5764}{5764,83}) + \\cos&#94;{-1}(\\frac{5764}{5764,0016}) \\\\ &\\approx 102 \\text{km} \\end{align} $ Antwort Der am weitesten entfernte Punkt, der direkt östlich vom Burdsch Chalifa steht und von dem aus die Spitze des Burdsch Chalifa unter optimalen Bedinungen noch erkannt werden kann, liegt ca. 102 km entfernt. Anmerkung: Mileiha liegt ca. 60 km vom Burdsch Chalifa entfernt. Er müsste also von Mileiha zu sehen sein.","tags":"German posts","title":"Sichtweite des Burdsch Chalifa"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/entwurfsmuster-beispiele/","text":"Singleton Zweck : Stelle sicher, dass es nur eine Instanz dieser Klasse gibt.

Then it gets extended by AbstractClass with templateMethod() , simpleOperation1() and simpleOperation2() . After that, the method overrides simpleOperation1() and simpleOperation2() , but templateMethod() uses them. It uses the methods that are now in ConcreteClass .

Unter anderem gibt es nur zwei Gruppen mit vier Elementen. alle anderen Gruppen sind isomorph zu diesen Gruppen. Das zeige ich im folgendem. Gruppen mit vier Elementen Es gibt genau zwei Gruppen mit vier Elementen. Das sind: \\(G_1 = (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}, +)\\) und \\(G_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}, +)\\) Beweis Teil 1: G 1 und G 2 sind Gruppen Eine Gruppe \\((A, \\circ)\\) müssen drei Eigenschaften erfüllen: (G1) Assoziativität : \\(\\forall a,b,c \\in A: (a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)\\) (G2) Neutrales Element : \\(\\exists e \\in A \\forall a \\in A: e \\circ a = a \\circ e = a\\) (G3) Inverses Element : \\(\\forall a \\in A \\exists a&#94;{-1} \\in A: a \\circ a&#94;{-1} = a&#94;{-1} \\circ a = e\\) Die Verknüpfungstafel für \\(G_1\\) lautet: + 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 0 2 2 3 0 1 3 3 0 1 2 Man sieht direkt an der Tabelle, dass 0 das neutrale Element ist und jedes Element ein Inverses hat. Für die Assoziativität fällt mir nichts besseres ein, als die 64 Möglichkeiten alle auszuprobieren. Geht das kürzer? Die Verknüpfungstafel für \\(G_2\\) lautet: + (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (0,0) (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1) (0,1) (0,0) (1,1) (1,0) (1,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (1,1) (1,0) (0,1) (0,0) Das neutrale Element ist hier also (0,0) . Beweis Teil 2: Es gibt keine weiteren Gruppen Hierfür ist es sehr hilfreich zu wissen, dass die Verknüpfungstafel einer Gruppe immer alle Elemente sowohl in jeder Spalte, als auch in jeder Zeile hat. Dann kann man es Sudoku-mäßig beweisen. Folgendes Skelett gilt immer: + e a b c e e a b c a a b b c c #1: e auf (1,1) Wir haben nun folgende Tabelle: + e a b c e e a b c a a e c b b b c c c b \\(b + a = c\\) (da a und e in dieser Spalte sind und b in der Zeile ist) \\(c + a = b\\) (nur b fehlt in der Spalte) \\(a + b = c\\) (da a und e in dieser Zeile und b in der Spalte bereits vorkommt) \\(a + c = b\\) (nur b fehlt in der Zeile) #1.1: e auf (2,2) + e a b c e e a b c a a e c b b b c e a c c b a e $c + c = e$ (genau 1 e pro Zeile / Spalte) $b + c = a$ (nur a fehlt in der Zeile) $c + b = a$ (nur a fehlt in der Zeile) Diese Lösung enstpricht \\(G_2\\) . #1.2: a auf (2, 2) + e a b c e e a b c a a e c b b b c a e c c b e a $b + c = e$ (genau 1 e pro Zeile / Spalte) $c + b = e$ (genau 1 e pro Zeile / Spalte) $c + c = a$ (nur a fehlt in der Zeile) Das entspricht \\(G_1\\) .

Eine bijektive Selbstabbildung von M heißt Permutation . Die Menge $S_M$ der Permutationen von M ist eine Gruppe bezüglich der Verkettung $\\circ$ von Abbildungen und heißt symmetrische Gruppe von M. Quelle: Skript von Herrn Prof. Dr. Leuzinger, KIT Allgemeines Es ist nun egal, ob ich die Permutationen von {1, 2, 3} oder {42, 1337, ABC} anschaue. Es sind einfach nur drei Objekte, die unterscheidbar sind. Um es einfacher zu machen, gehen wir nun von den Objekten {1, 2, ..., m} aus. Alle Permutationen dieser Objekte bilden eine Gruppe. Diese nennen wir \\(S_m\\) . Ein einzelnes Element aus \\(S_m\\) wird meist \\(\\pi\\) oder \\(\\sigma\\) genannt, also \\(\\pi \\in S_m\\) . Da \\(\\pi\\) eine Permutation ist, ist es insbesondere eine bijektive Selbstabbildung, also: $$M = {1, ..., m}$$ $$\\pi: M \\rightarrow M$$ $$i \\mapsto \\pi(i)$$ Kurz schreibt man auch: (\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & ... & m\\\\ \\pi(1) & \\pi(2) & \\pi(3) & ... & \\pi(m) \\end{pmatrix} ) Anzahl der Permutationen Wenn ich n Elemente habe, die ich auf n Plätze verteilen muss: Wie viele unterschiedliche Zuordnungen von Elementen zu den Plätzen gibt es? Die Antwort ist \\(n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot ... (n - 1) \\cdot n = \\prod_{i=1}&#94;n i\\) . Für das erste Element sind \\(n\\) Plätze frei. Das Zweite kann nur noch auf \\((n-1)\\) Plätze verteilt werden, ... , das letzte hat nur noch einen Platz zur \"Auswahl\". Erzeugung der Permutationen Angenommen, man muss in einem Test \\(S_3\\) explizit angeben. Wie geht das? Nun, zu erst erzeugt man alle Permutationen. Dafür rechnet man sich die Anzahl aus. Es gibt 3 Elemente, also \\(3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6\\) Permutationen: 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ 4. _ 5. _ 6. _ _ _ Nun zuerst zum ersten Element, der 1. Diese kann ich an die erste, die zweite oder die dritte Stelle verschieben. Also: 1. 1 _ 2. 1 _ 3. _ 1 4. _ 1 5. _ 1 6. _ 1 Nun zum zweiten Element, der 2. Wieder das gleiche Prinzip: Und nun nur noch das letzte Einfüllen: 1. 1 2 _ 2. 1 _ 2 3. 2 1 _ 4. _ 1 2 5. 2 _ 1 6. _ 2 1 1. 1 2 3 2. 1 3 2 3. 2 1 3 4. 3 1 2 5. 2 3 1 6. 3 2 1 Und nun noch als Menge in der mathematischen Schreibweise aufschreiben: (S_3 = \\left { \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} } {\\pi_1}, \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} } , \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} } {\\pi_3}, \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} } , \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} } {\\pi_5}, \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} } \\right }) Verkettung Was passiert, wenn ich die Permuation \\(\\pi_2\\) mit der Permutation \\(\\pi_3\\) verkette? Also: (\\pi_x(i) = \\pi_2(\\pi_3(i)) = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\pi_6) Aber: (\\pi_y(i) = \\pi_3(\\pi_2(i)) = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\pi_5 \\neq \\pi_6) Die Verkettung von Permutationen ist also nicht kommutativ! Es ergibt sich insgesamt folgende Verknüfungstabelle (gelesen wird: Zeile zuerst, Spalte später): \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_6\\) \\(\\pi_5\\) \\(\\pi_4\\) \\(\\pi_3\\) \\(\\pi_2\\) \\(\\pi_1\\) Man sieht nun, und das finde ich durchaus erstaunlich, man landet immer wieder in \\(S_3\\) . Durch die Verknüpfung von Permutationen kommt also immer wieder eine Permutation heraus! Das bedeutet, () ist unter dieser Verknüpfung abgeschlossen. Man kann nun auch noch sehen, jedes Element aus \\((S_3, \\circ)\\) ein inverses hat, da in jeder Zeile ein mal \\(\\pi_1\\) vorkommt. Außerdem ist \\((S_3, \\circ)\\) assoziativ. Kurz: \\((S_3, \\circ)\\) ist eine Gruppe, die jedoch nicht abelsch ist. Es wurde in der Vorlesung auch gezeigt, dass allgemein \\((S_m, \\circ)\\) eine Gruppe ist. Die Fehlstandszahl Es sei $\\pi \\in S_m$ eine Permutation. Die Fehlstandszahl $F(\\pi)$ von $\\pi$ ist die (eindeutige) Anzahl der Fälle, in denen für $i < k$ gilt $\\pi(i) > \\pi(k)$ . Die Permutationen mit gerader Fehlstandszahl $F(\\pi)$ heißen gerade, die Permutationen mit ungerader Fehlstandszahl heißen ungerade. Beispiele (\\pi_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 0. (\\pi_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 1, da \\(i = 2 < 3 = k\\) gilt, aber \\(\\pi_2(2) = 3 > 2 = \\pi_2(3)\\) . (\\pi_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 1. (\\pi_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 2. (\\pi_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 2. (\\pi_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} ) hat die Fehlstandszahl 2. Transposition Eine Transposition ist eine Permutation aus $S_m$, bei der zwei verschiedene, fest gewahlte Zahlen $i, k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., m\\}$ vertauscht werden, während alle anderen Zahlen fest bleiben. Man schreibt fur diese Transposition auch kurz $(i~k)$. Transpositionen werden gerne mit \\(\\tau\\) abgekürzt. Also: \\(\\pi_2 = (2~3), \\pi_3=(1~2), \\pi_6 = (1~3)\\) sind Transpositionen. \\(\\pi_1, \\pi_4, \\pi_5\\) sind keine Transpositionen. Es gilt: \\(\\tau \\circ \\tau = id\\) wir haben in der Vorlesung gezeigt: Jede Permutation \\(\\pi \\in S_m, m \\geq 2,\\) lässt sich als Verkettung von Transpositionen darstellen. Beispiel: (\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 6 & 5 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 2\\end{pmatrix} = (1~6) \\circ (2~5) \\circ (3~4) \\circ (4~6) \\circ (5~6)) Gelesen wird das ganze von rechts nach links. Die Transposition \\((5~6)\\) wird also zuerst angewendet. Wie bei Abbildungen die verkettet werden halt auch. Die Fehlstandszahl von \\(\\sigma\\) ist 13 und die Anzahl der Transpositionen ist ungerade. Interessanterweise gilt auch \\(\\sigma = (1~4) \\circ (3~5) \\circ (2~6) \\circ (1~3) \\circ (1~2)\\) . Außerdem kann man beliebig häufig eine Transposition doppelt hinzufügen, da es ja die Identität ist. Die Darstellung einer Permutation als folge von Transpositionen ist also nicht eindeutig.

Sie zeigt eine \"ist ein\"-Beziehung an. Beispiele sind: Tiger ist eine Großkatze ist eine Katze ist ein Raubtier ist ein Tier . Auto ist ein Fortbewegungsmittel . Auto ist ein Luxusgut . Beachte dass Auto hier sowohl von Luxusgut , als auch von Fortbewegungsmittel erbt. Das geht in manchen Programmiersprachen (C++, Python), in anderen nicht (Java). Assoziation Assoziation Die Assoziation zeigt eine Verbindung an, z.B.: Person - Termin: Eine Person hat Termine; Termine gehören zu einer Person. Lehrer - Schüler: Ein Schüler hat Lehrer; Lehrer haben Schüler. Auto - Fahrer: Ein Auto hat einen Fahrer; ein Fahrer hat ein Auto. In einer Datenbank würde man für diese Relationen eine weitere Tabelle erstellen. Also eine Tabelle für Personen, eine für Termine und eine für Person-Termin-Verknüpfungen. Aggregation Aggregation Die Aggregation ist eine spezielle Assoziation. Sie zeigt eine \"hat\"-Beziehung an. Dabei ist die Richtung wichtig und sollte angezeigt werden. Aggregationen sind z.B.: PKW hat Räder Eltern haben Kinder Buchladen hat Bücher Komposition Komposition Die Komposition zeigt eine notwendige \"ist-Teil-von\" Beziehung an. Das Teil kann also nicht ohne das Ganze existieren.

Answer 0 , 1 or -1 . Explanaition First the simple ones: 0 is the result you would expect. One thread executes and reduces globalVar to 0 , the other one does nothing and then globalVar gets printed. If the main program is faster than any of the two threads, it prints 1 before globalVar gets reduced. Now the most interesting one: -1 . This is called a race condition . You have to know that globalVar-- is not an atomic operation. First you have to get the value, then you have to reduce it and after that you can save the value. This is an order of execution which would lead to a wrong value: First Thread Second Thread test.globalVar text checks if (globalVar > 0) looping ... looping ... execute test.globalVar--; text . checks if (globalVar > 0) execute all four bytecode commands of \"test.globalVar--;\" . text 1 1 0 -1 Resolve this problem Use join() if you don't want to get 1 as output. If you don't want to get -1 , you should take a look at the keyword synchronised . A side note With javap -c MyParallelClass you can view the bytecode of the class MyParallelClass . It looks like this: Compiled from \"MyParallelClass.java\" public class MyParallelClass extends java . lang . Object implements java . lang .

SQLite ) und Dateisysteme (z.B. ext3 ) eingesetzt wird. Im Folgenden sollte man immer im Hinterkopf behalten, dass an den Schlüsseln auch Werte - sog. Satellitendaten - hängen. Der Einfachheit halber lasse ich diese aber hier weg. Definition Die folgende Definition ist sinngemäß aus \"Introduction to Algorithms\" von Thomas H. Cormen übernommen. Für einen B-Baum der Ordnung t , \\(t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{1\\}\\) , gilt: Jeder Knoten $x$ hat die folgenden Attribute: $n$, die Anzahl der Schlüssel die im Knoten $x$ gespeichert wird, die $n$ Schlüssel, die in aufsteigender Reihenfolge gespeichert werden (also $key_1 \\leq key_2 \\leq ... \\leq key_{n}$), $isLeaf$, ein boolscher Wert der True ist, falls $x$ ein Blatt ist und False ist, falls $x$ ein innerer Knoten ist Jeder innere Knoten hat $n + 1$ Zeiger $c_1, c_2, ... c_{n+1}$ auf seine Kinder. Blattknoten haben keine Kinder, also sind ihre $c_i$-Attribute undefiniert. Ein Knoten eines B-Baumes sieht also so aus: Node of a B-tree Die Schlüssel $key_i$ setzen grenzen für die Werte der Schlüssel, die in den einzelnen Subbäumen gespeichert sind. Falls $k_i$ ein Schlüssel im Subbaum mit der Wurzel $c_i$ ist, dann gilt: $k_1 \\leq key_1 \\leq k_2 \\leq key_2 \\leq ... \\leq key_{n} \\leq k_{n} \\leq key_{n+1}$ Alle Blätter haben die gleiche Tiefe. Für die Anzahl der Schlüssel eines Knotens gilt: Jeder Knoten (bis auf die Wurzel) hat mindestens t-1 Schlüssel. Jeder Knoten hat höchstens $2t - 1$ Schlüssel. Stolperfallen Ein Schlüssel ist etwas anderes als ein Zeiger! Folgerungen $(2) \\Rightarrow$ Die Wurzel hat min. 2 Kinder, falls der Baum nicht leer ist. $(2), (5.1) \\Rightarrow$ Jeder innere Knoten (bis auf die Wurzel) hat min. t Kinder. $(2), (5.2) \\Rightarrow$ Jeder innere Knoten hat maximal 2t Kinder. Wenn man an den Zeigern die Kinder in die Elterknoten zieht, sodass am Ende alle Knoten in der Wurzel sind, entsteht wegen (3) eine sortierte Liste. $ h \\leq \\log_t \\frac{n+1}{2}$ (Cormen, S. 489) Ein B-Baum hat in der Tiefe h min. $2t&#94;{h-1}$ Knoten. Besondere B-Bäume Ein B-Baum der Ordnung t = 2 wird auch 2-3-4-Baum genannt, da jeder Knoten entweder 2, 3 oder 4 Kinder hat. Ich habe ja ausgeschlossen, dass es einen B-Baum der Ordnung t = 1 gibt. Warum eigentlich? Aus (5.1) folgt: In einem B-Baum der Ordnung t = 1 müssten einzelne Knoten keine Schlüssel haben. Das ist nicht sinnvoll. Also muss \\(t \\geq 2\\) gelten. Suchen eines Schlüssels Das Suchen eines Schlüssels funktioniert so: SEARCH - KEY ( node , key ): int i = 0 while i < node . n and node . key [ i ] . key < key : i += 1 if node . key [ i ] . key == key : # Schl&uuml;ssel ist gesuchter Schl&uuml;ssel return node . key [ i ] . satelittendaten else if node . isLeaf : # Erfolglose Suche return NIL else : # Rekursiv weitersuchen DISK - READ ( node . c [ i ]) return SEARCH - KEY ( node . c [ i ], key ) Es wird also zuerst der Knoten durchsucht und dann gegebenenfalls der passende Subbaum. Laut Vorlesung (Folie 97) gilt: Anzahl Zugriffe auf Hintergrundspeicher maximal: \\({\\cal O}(\\log_t(n))\\) Innerhalb eines Knotens: \\({\\cal O}(t)\\) Insgesamt also: \\({\\cal O}(t \\cdot \\log_t(n))\\) Einfügen von Schlüsseln Wenn ein Schlüssel in einen B-Baum eingefügt werden soll, dann muss man insebesondere auf Regel (5.1) und (5.2) achten: Jeder Knoten enthält n Schlüssel, mit \\(t-1 \\leq n \\leq 2t -1\\) . Die Idee ist, dass man das Blatt sucht, in dem der Schlüssel sein müsste. Falls noch Platz ist, kann man den Schlüssel einfach einfügen. Falls nicht, muss man das Blatt aufsplitten. Beispiel zu Fall 1: Es ist noch Platz Abb. 2: B-Baum der Ordnung t = 2 In den B-Baum aus Abb. 2 soll nun der Schlüssel 16 eingefügt werden. In einem B-Baum der Ordnung 2 hat jeder Knoten mindestens einen und höchstens 3 Schlüssel. Egal wo wir also landen würden, es würde noch in diesen Baum passen. Wir landen aber im Knoten rechts unten, da \\(11 < 16\\) ist. Das Ergebnis ist also: Abb. 3: B-Baum der Ordnung t = 2 Beispiel zu Fall 2: Knotenüberlauf Will man nun in den B-Baum der Ordnung 2 aus Abb. 3 den Schlüssel 17 hinzufügen, so gibt es einen \"Knotenüberlauf\". Der Schlüssel müsste in den Knoten rechts unten. Damit hätte dieser 4 Schlüssel, er darf aber nur 3 haben. Also splitten wir zuerst den Knoten. Schlüssel 15 wandert zu dem Elternknoten hoch, die beiden einzelnen Schlüssel bilden eigene Knoten. Damit man sieht, was mit den Schlüsseln geschehen würde, wenn der Baum größer wäre, habe ich diese mal eingefärbt: Abb. 4: B-Baum der Ordnung t = 2 Nun ist man beim Einfügen von 17 wieder in Fall 1. Das Ergebnis sieht so aus: Abb. 5: B-Baum der Ordnung t = 2 Natürlich kann es auch passieren, dass beim hochwandern des mittleren Knoten (15 von Abb. 3 nach Abb. 4) der Elternknoten überläuft. Dann muss halt auch dieser gesplittet werden. Wenn die Wurzel überläuft, muss eine neue Wurzel erstellt werden. Dann kann die alte Wurzel gesplittet werden. Die Laufzeit des Einfügens ist in \\({\\cal O}(t \\cdot \\log_t(n))\\) . Löschen eines Schlüssels Falls sich der Schlüssel in einem Blatt befindet, kann man ihn einfach löschen. Allerdings muss man darauf achten, dass mindestens t-1 Schlüssel im Knoten verbleiben. Ist der Schlüssel in einem inneren Knoten ist das ganze schwerer. Fall 1: Schlüssel in Blatt Der Einfachste Fall ist der 1. Fall des Einfügens , nur umgekehrt. Also aus dem B-Baum aus Abb. 3 die 16 entfernen. Dann entsteht der B-Baum aus Abb. 2. Fall 2 - 3 Für die anderen Fälle habe ich leider kein kleines Beispiel und will deshalb auf die Erklärung verzichten. Falls ihr da Hilfe braucht: Cormen, dritte Ausgabe, S. 499ff war sehr hilfreich.

Trivia [...] standard B-trees had numerous characteristics that were at odds with the ext2 design philosophy of simplicity and robustness. For example, XFS's B-tree implementation was larger than all of ext2 or ext3's source files combined. Source: ext2.sourceforge.net Beispiel Fügt man die Schlüssel 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 in einen anfangs leeren B-Baum ein, entwickelt sich dieser wie folgt: Entwicklung eines B-Baumes der Ordnung t = 3 Die grauen Felder sind für Zeiger reserviert. Ist kein Zeiger eingezeichnet, dann ist es ein NIL-Zeiger. Siehe auch Which datastructure do nodes of B-Trees use?

Es gibt weitaus mehr Datenstrukturen (z.B. Bloomfilter ), als ich hier erwähne. Diese Datenstrukturen wurden in der Vorlesung Algorithmen I bei Frau Zitterbart am KIT erklärt. Array Array Ein Array, auch Feld genannt, ist eine Datenstruktur. Charakteristika: Ein Array hat eine feste, nicht veränderbare Größe. Der Zugriff auf jedes beliebige Element erfolgt in konstanter Zeit - ist also insbesondere unabhängig von der Größe! Dynamische Arrays Dynamische Arrays sind wie normale Arrays, nur dass sie wachsen können. Sobald ein Element eingefügt werden soll, dass nicht mehr ins Array passen würde, allokiert man ein doppelt so großes Array und kopiert die Elemente um. In Java ist es ein Vector bzw. eine ArrayList , in C++ Vektoren . Hashtabelle In der Informatik bezeichnet man eine spezielle Indexstruktur als Hashtabelle (englisch hash table oder hash map) bzw. Streuwerttabelle. Als Indexstruktur werden Hashtabellen verwendet um Datenelemente in einer großen Datenmenge aufzufinden. Zu Hashtabellen alternative Index-Datenstrukturen sind beispielsweise Baumstrukturen (wie etwa ein B+-Baum) und die Skip-List. Hashtabellen zeichnen sich durch einen üblicherweise konstanten Zeitaufwand bei Einfüge- bzw. Entfernen-Operationen aus. Beim Einsatz einer Hashtabelle zur Suche in Datenmengen spricht man auch von einem Hashverfahren oder Streuspeicherverfahren. Quelle: Hashtabelle Hashtabellen werden hier benutzt: Python 3.2.3: Modules/_pickle.c Java OpenJDK 7: java.util.HashTable und sehr viele mehr benutzen es (Properties.java, Dictionary.java, Enum.java, ...) Sie garantieren eine amortisierte Laufzeit von \\({\\cal O}(1)\\) für Suchen, Löschen und Einfügen. Folgende Begriffe sollte man kennen: Divisions-Rest-Methode : \\(h(k) = k \\mod m\\) Multiplikationsmethode : \\(h(k) = \\lfloor A \\cdot k \\mod 1 \\rfloor\\) , mit z.B. \\(A \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\) offenes Hashing Doppeltes Hashing : \\(h(k, i) = (h_1(k) + i \\cdot h_2(k)) \\mod m\\) Lineares und quadratische Sondieren Belegungsfaktor: \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Anzahl gespeicherter Elemente}}{\\text{Anzahl der Slots}}\\) Primäre und sekundäre Clusterbildung Stack Stack a capacity of 5 elements and size of 4. Stacks, auch \" Stapelspeicher \" oder \"Kellerspeicher\" genannt, sind eine elementare Datenstruktur. Es sollte sie in jeder Sprache geben. In Java ist es in java.util.Stack , in Python sind es Listen und natürlich gibt es auch in C++ Stacks . Wie man am Bild sehr schön sehen kann, definiert ein Stack keine Ordnung über die Elemente. Wenn ein neues Element kommt, wird es auf den Stack gelegt. Man kann auch nur das oberste Element - in diesem Fall a - vom Stack nehmen. Deshalb werden Stacks auch als LIFO-Speicher ( L ast I n F irst O ut) bezeichnet. Stacks werden mit dynamischen Arrays realisiert. Dazu mal ein kleines Beispiel: import java.util.Stack ; public class test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { Stack < Integer > s = new Stack < Integer >(); s . add ( 12 ); s . push ( 13 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++) { s . push ( i ); System . out . printf ( \"size: %d \\t capacity: %d\\n\" , s . size (), s . capacity ()); } while ( s . size () > 0 ) { System . out . printf ( \"Element: %d \\t size: %d \\t capacity: %d\\n\" , s . pop (), s . size (), s . capacity ()); } } } Ausgabe: size: 3 capacity: 10 size: 4 capacity: 10 size: 5 capacity: 10 size: 6 capacity: 10 size: 7

It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. Operation Worst-Case-Laufzeit Anmerkungen Push ${\\cal O}(1)$ Ein Element auf den Stack legen Pop ${\\cal O}(1)$ Das oberste Element von der Liste nehmen Ein Stack lässt sich als doppelt verkettete, zyklische Liste implementieren. Warteschlangen Warteschlangen, auch Queues genannt, sind Stacks sehr ähnlich. Beide unterstützen prinzipiell nur zwei Operationen. Bei Stacks nanne es sich PUSH und POP, bei Warteschlangen heißt es ENQUEUE und DEQUEUE. Im Unterschied zum Stack wird bei der Warteschlange das Element nicht von oben wieder weggenommen, sondern von hinten. Das Bild einer Warteschlange ist hier sehr passend.

Nachfolger \\({\\cal O}(1)\\) Bäume In der Vorlesung wurden Bäume sehr unpräzise eingeführt. Ich versuche das mal etwas präziser zu machen: Sei \\(G = (V, E)\\) ein gerichteter Graph. \\(G\\) heißt gerichteter Baum \\(: \\Leftrightarrow \\exists_{r \\in V} \\forall_{x \\in V}:\\) Es exisitert genau ein Pfad von \\(r\\) nach \\(x\\) . Sei $G = (V, E)$ ein gerichteter Baum und sei $r \\in V$ das $r$ aus der Definition. $r$ heißt Wurzel von $G$. ACHTUNG: Die folgende Definition habe ich mir ausgedacht! NICHT IN DER KLAUSUR VERWENDEN! Sei \\(E \\subseteq V \\times V\\) eine Menge ungerichteter Kanten. Dann bezeichne \\(G(E) := \\{(v, w) | \\{v, w\\} \\in E\\}\\) die Menge aller zugehörigen gerichteten Kanten. Sei $U = (V, E)$ ein ungerichteter Graph. $U$ heißt ein ungerichteter Baum $:\\Leftrightarrow \\exists$ gerichteten Baum $G = (V, E')$ mit $E' \\subsetneq G(E)$. Sei $G = (V, E)$ ein Baum und $x, y \\in V$. $x$ heißt Elternknoten von $y :\\Leftrightarrow x$ liegt auf dem Pfad von der Wurzel nach $y$ direkt vor $y$.

B-Bäume B-Baum der Ordnung 2 B-Baum der Ordnung 3 Ein B-Baum ist ein immer vollständig balancierter Baum, der Daten sortiert nach Schlüsseln speichert. Er kann binär sein, ist aber im Allgemeinen kein Binärbaum. Das Einfügen, Suchen und Löschen von Daten in B-Bäumen ist in amortisiert logarithmischer Zeit möglich. B-Bäume wachsen – und schrumpfen – anders als viele Suchbäume von den Blättern hin zur Wurzel. Quelle: Wikipedia Die beiden abgebildeten B-Bäume sind entstanden, indem die Zahlen von 0 bis 19 in aufsteigener Reihenfolge eingefügt wurden. Für einen B-Baum der Ordnung t, \\(t \\geq 2\\) , gilt: Alle Pfade von der Wurzel zu einem Blatt sind gleich lang. Die Wurzel hat mindestens 2, höchstens 2t Kinder. Alle anderen inneren Knoten haben mindestens t, höchstens 2t Kinder. Jeder Knoten mit i Kindern hat i-1 Schlüssel. Die beiden B-Bäume habe ich mit diesem Script erstellt.

To specify them, go to: Run → Run Configurations ... → Arguments args4j args4j is a small Java class library that makes it easy to parse command line options/arguments in your CUI application. Source: args4j.kohsuke.org Lets see how easy it really is. Requirements First, you have to get the package. It is not in my Ubuntu-Version, but Ubuntu Quantal will have args4j . The package is called libargs4j-java . If you can't install it this way, you have to download args4j . Currently, it is args4j-2.0.21.jar . You can add this as an external jar to Eclipse: Right-click on your project. Select \"Properties\" Type \"java build path\" in the input field at the upper left corner of the window. Now it should look like this: Project properties in Eclipse - Libraries Now you have to click on \"Add External Jar\" and add the args4j.jar file. Source Example As always in Java, you add another class for parsing your command line values. I've called it CommandLineValues.java and it does only check for the command line argument -i FILE or --input FILE . import java.io.File ; import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineException ; import org.kohsuke.args4j.CmdLineParser ; import org.kohsuke.args4j.Option ; /** * This class handles the programs arguments. */ public class CommandLineValues { @Option ( name = \"-i\" , aliases = { \"--input\" }, required = true , usage = \"input file with two matrices\" ) private File source ; private boolean errorFree = false ; public CommandLineValues ( String ... args ) { CmdLineParser parser = new CmdLineParser ( this ); parser . setUsageWidth ( 80 ); try { parser . parseArgument ( args ); if (! getSource (). isFile ()) { throw new CmdLineException ( parser , \"--input is no valid input file.\" ); } errorFree = true ; } catch ( CmdLineException e ) { System . err . println ( e . getMessage ()); parser . printUsage ( System . err ); } } /** * Returns whether the parameters could be parsed without an * error. * * @return true if no error occurred. */ public boolean isErrorFree () { return errorFree ; } /** * Returns the source file. * * @return The source file. */ public File getSource () { return source ; } } Here is some part of the main file: public static void main ( String [] args ) { CommandLineValues values = new CommandLineValues ( args ); CmdLineParser parser = new CmdLineParser ( values ); try { parser . parseArgument ( args ); } catch ( CmdLineException e ) { System . exit ( 1 ); } // Now you can use the command line values List < ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >>> matrices = read ( values . getSource ()); ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >> A = matrices . get ( 0 ); ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >> B = matrices . get ( 1 ); int [][] C = ijkAlgorithm ( A , B ); printMatrix ( C ); } Usage Examples If you do not specify the required parameters, you get a quite good error message: moose@pc07:~/Desktop$ java -jar matrix-multiplication.jar Option \"-i (--input)\" is required -i ( --input ) FILE : input file with two matrices Help is not automatically generated: moose@pc07:~/Desktop$ java -jar matrix-multiplication.jar --help \"--help\" is not a valid option -i ( --input ) FILE : input file with two matrices If you want to have default parameters, you simply assign the values to the attributes: @Option ( name = \"-l\" , aliases = { \"--leafsize\" }, required = false , usage = \"input file with two matrices\" ) private int leafsize = 32 ; Note: How can I prevent Eclipse from adding the 'final' for certain lines of Java code? Commons CLI Installation As for args4j, they offer a jar file which is in commons-cli-1.2-bin.tar.gz on the download-page . If you just want to test if you have the required packages, copy this piece of code to Eclipse: public class CommandLineValues { CommandLineParser parser = new BasicParser (); } If you get the following error, you don't have the required org.apache.commons.cli : Java error mentioned by Eclipse: Missing org.apache.commons.cli Usage examples I have not found a single, complete and working usage example.

The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments. Installation I had to install python-argparse on my old Ubuntu machine before I could use it. Usage As far as I've just tried it, you can use argparse very similar to optparse. See this diff for my switch from optparse to argparse for a simple script. It is very easy to add command line options argument (if you require an option, it would not be an option any more, would it? I'll try to call them arguments from now on): #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from argparse import ArgumentParser parser = ArgumentParser () # Add more options if you like parser . add_argument ( \"-f\" , \"--file\" , dest = \"myFilenameVariable\" , help = \"write report to FILE\" , metavar = \"FILE\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"-q\" , \"--quiet\" , action = \"store_false\" , dest = \"verbose\" , default = True , help = \"don't print status messages to stdout\" ) args = parser . parse_args () print ( args . myFilenameVariable ) Every option has some values like: dest : You will access the value of option with this variable help : This text gets displayed whey someone uses --help . default : If the command line argument was not specified, it will get this default value. action : Actions tell optparse what to do when it encounters an option on the command line. action defaults to store . These actions are available: store : take the next argument (or the remainder of the current argument), ensure that it is of the correct type, and store it to your chosen destination dest. store_true : store True in dest if this flag was set. store_false : store False in dest if this flag was set. store_const : store a constant value append : append this option's argument to a list count : increment a counter by one callback : call a specified function nargs : ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single action. required : Mark a command line argument as non-optional (required). choices : Some command-line arguments should be selected from a restricted set of values. These can be handled by passing a container object as the choices keyword argument to add_argument(). When the command line is parsed, argument values will be checked, and an error message will be displayed if the argument was not one of the acceptable values. type : Use this command, if the argument is of another type (e.g. int or float). argparse automatically generates a help text. So if you call python myScript.py --help you will get something like that: usage: ikjMultiplication.py [ -h ] [ -i FILE ] ikjMatrix multiplication optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -i FILE input file with two matrices Example 1: Fibonacci It is absolutely no problem to calculate the 100,000st Fibonacci number. #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def mul ( A , B ): a , b , c = A d , e , f = B return a * d + b * e , a * e + b * f , b * e + c * f def pow ( A , n ): if n == 1 : return A if n & 1 == 0 : return pow ( mul ( A , A ), n // 2 ) else : return mul ( A , pow ( mul ( A , A ), ( n - 1 ) // 2 )) def fib ( n ): if n < 2 : return n return pow (( 1 , 1 , 0 ), n - 1 )[ 0 ] if __name__ == \"__main__\" : import argparse parser = argparse .

It is rarely used in high-level code today. Code that makes use of it is called Spaghetti code by some people. I have almost never seen goto statements in code, so I've been curious about them. GOTO from xkcd.com Python Python does NOT offer GOTO. However, somebody made a GOTO module for April Fools' Day. See goto in Python if you're still interested. Java Java has no goto statement. Studies illustrated that goto is (mis)used more often than not simply \"because it's there\". Eliminating goto led to a simplification of the language--there are no rules about the effects of a goto into the middle of a for statement, for example. Studies on approximately 100,000 lines of C code determined that roughly 90 percent of the goto statements were used purely to obtain the effect of breaking out of nested loops. As mentioned above, multi-level break and continue remove most of the need for goto statements. Source: java.sun.com C++ GOTO works in C++. Here is a minimal example: Minimal Example #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int main (){ int test = 0 ; start :; if ( test > 10 ) { goto end ; } else { test += 7 ; goto start ; } end :; cout << \"test: \" << test << endl ; return 0 ; } Output: test: 14 Euclidean GCD algorithm Most of you might know the euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor in a version like this one: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int euclidGCD ( int a , int b ) { while ( b != 0 ) { int m = a % b ; a = b ; b = m ; } return a ; } int main (){ // Outputs 20 cout << \"GCD of 340 and 32760: \" << euclidGCD ( 340 , 32760 ) << endl ; return 0 ; } Here is a goto-version that works perfectly fine: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int euclidGCD ( int a , int b ) { if ( b > a ) goto b_larger ; while ( 1 ) { a = a % b ; if ( a == 0 ) return b ; b_larger : b = b % a ; if ( b == 0 ) return a ; } } int main (){ cout << \"GCD of 340 and 32760: \" << euclidGCD ( 340 , 32760 ) << endl ; return 0 ; } Source: literateprograms.org Try bad things You can't jump into a function: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int myFunction ( int i ) { i += 1 ; inFunctionLabel :; i += 1 ; return i ; } int main (){ int test = 0 ; goto inFunctionLabel ; cout << \"test: \" << test << endl ; return 0 ; } Compiler error: gotoExample.cpp: In function & lsquo ; int myFunction ( int ) & rsquo ; : gotoExample.cpp:7: warning: label & lsquo ; inFunctionLabel & rsquo ; defined but not used gotoExample.cpp: In function & lsquo ; int main () & rsquo ; : gotoExample.cpp:15: error: label & lsquo ; inFunctionLabel & rsquo ; used but not defined So goto is at least bound to its scope.","tags":"Code","title":"GOTO in Python, Java and C++"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/java-puzzle-1-pre-and-postincrement/","text":"The puzzle What is the output of the following piece of code? public class test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { int i = 1 ; i += ++ i + i ++ + ++ i ; int j = 1 ; j += ++ j + j ++ + ++ j ; int k = 1 ; k += k ++ + k ++ + ++ k ; int m = 1 ; System . out . println ( \"i = \" + i ); System . out . println ( \"j = \" + j ); System . out . println ( \"k = \" + k ); System . out . println ( \"m = \" + ( m += 1 )); } } . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Answer The output is: i = 9 j = 9 k = 8 m = 2 Explanation Part one First, take a look at statements of this structure: i += s where i is the integer and s is a statement (e.g. ++i ). This gets evaluated to i = a + s Source: docs.oracle.com Part two Lets take a look at pre- and postincrement in Java. You can quite easily figure out what the different increments do by this snippet: public class test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { int i = 0 ; int j = 0 ; int k = 0 ; System . out . println ( \"i = \" + ++ i ); System . out . println ( \"i = \" + i ); System . out . println ( \"j = \" + j ++); System . out . println ( \"j = \" + j ); System . out . println ( \"k = \" + ( k += 1 )); } } Output: i = 1 i = 1 j = 0 j = 1 k = 1 Line 7 adds +1 to i and returns the value. Line 10 returns the value of j and adds +1 to j . Line 13 adds +1 to k and returns k . Lets return to the original puzzle. Java parses your code from left to right ( Source 1 , Source 2 ). Most important: Evaluation of an expression can also produce side effects, because expressions may contain embedded assignments, increment operators, decrement operators, and method invocations. So: int i = 1 ; i += ++ i + i ++ + ++ i ; is the same as i = (( i + (++ i )) + ( i ++)) + (++ i ); The first ++i increments i to 2 and returns 2. So you have: i = 2 ; i = (( 1 + 2 ) + ( i ++)) + (++ i ); The i++ returns 2, as it is the new value of i , and increments i to 3: i = 3 ; i = (( 1 + 2 ) + 2 ) + ++ i ; The second ++i increments i to 4 and returns 4: i = 4 ; i += (( 1 + 2 ) + 2 ) + 4 ; So you end up with 9 . A parse tree of this evaluation would look like this: Parse tree The explanation for the other three ones is similar.

One of the most famous examples I know is \"+\". If you add two elements from \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) you will use the same character \"+\" as you use for adding two numbers from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . You even use the plus-sign if you add matrices (which is obviously something different than adding single numbers). In some programming languages, like C++, you can overload operators by yourself. First simple example Imagine you wanted to store some data - lets say the prename, surname and age - about people you know. This could be done in a struct . After you've stored it, you would like to print this information. Obviously, you don't want to do something like this: for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { cout << \"Person(\" << myArray [ i ]. prename << \" \" << myArray [ i ]. surname << \", \" << myArray [ i ]. age << \")\" ; } If you wanted to print this information more than one time, you would have to add this long line every time. A toString() method like the one Java uses would be nice. In C++, you don't have toString, but you can overload the << operator! This is how it works: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; typedef struct person { // attributes string prename ; string surname ; int age ; // constructor person ( string p , string s , int age ) : prename ( p ), surname ( s ), age ( age ) {} } Person ; // \"toString\" for C++ std :: ostream & operator << ( std :: ostream & strm , const person & a ) { return strm << \"Person(\" << a . prename << \" \" << a . surname << \", \" << a . age << \")\" ; } int main (){ Person Martin ( \"Martin\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person Andreas ( \"Andreas\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person AndiOld ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 30 ); Person AndiYoung ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 22 ); Person myArray [] = { Martin , Andreas , AndiOld , AndiYoung }; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { cout << myArray [ i ] << endl ; } return 0 ; } Sorting You can sort by overloading < . You can use a sort by adding #include <algorithm> to your program and using sort(array, array + elements); This is how it looks like: #include <iostream> #include <algorithm> using namespace std ; typedef struct person { // attributes string prename ; string surname ; int age ; // constructor person ( string p , string s , int age ) : prename ( p ), surname ( s ), age ( age ) {} } Person ; // \".equals()\" for C++ bool operator < ( const Person & a , const Person & b ){ if ( ! ( a . prename == b . prename )) { return a . prename < b . prename ; } else if ( ! ( a . surname < b . surname )) { return a . surname < b . surname ; } else { return a . age < b . age ; } } // \"toString\" for C++ std :: ostream & operator << ( std :: ostream & strm , const person & a ) { return strm << \"Person(\" << a . prename << \" \" << a . surname << \", \" << a . age << \")\" ; } int main (){ Person Martin ( \"Martin\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person Andreas ( \"Andreas\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person AndiOld ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 30 ); Person AndiYoung ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 22 ); Person myArray [] = { Martin , Andreas , AndiOld , AndiYoung }; sort ( myArray , myArray + 4 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { cout << myArray [ i ] << endl ; } return 0 ; } By the way, if you don't define < you get something like this: In file included from / usr / include / c ++/ 4.4 / algorithm : 62 , from operators . cpp : 2 : / usr / include / c ++/ 4.4 / bits / stl_algo . h : In function & lsquo ;

I know this example does NOT make any sense. But it is an example you can work with: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; typedef struct person { // attributes string prename ; string surname ; int age ; // constructor person ( string p , string s , int age ) : prename ( p ), surname ( s ), age ( age ) {} } Person ; // \"comperator\" for C++ bool operator == ( const Person & a , const Person & b ){ return a . age == 30 ; } int main (){ Person Martin ( \"Martin\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person Andreas ( \"Andreas\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person AndiOld ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 30 ); Person AndiYoung ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 22 ); Person myArray [] = { Martin , Andreas , AndiOld , AndiYoung }; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { cout << ( myArray [ i ] == myArray [ i ]) << endl ; } return 0 ; } Casting You can also define casts: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; typedef struct person { // attributes string prename ; string surname ; int age ; // constructor person ( string p , string s , int age ) : prename ( p ), surname ( s ), age ( age ) {} // prefix operator int () { return age ; } } Person ; int main (){ Person Martin ( \"Martin\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person Andreas ( \"Andreas\" , \"Thoma\" , 22 ); Person AndiOld ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 30 ); Person AndiYoung ( \"Andreas\" , \"Berger\" , 22 ); Person myArray [] = { Martin , Andreas , AndiOld , AndiYoung }; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { cout << int ( myArray [ i ]) << endl ; } return 0 ; } Adding new operators I like Python very much. Python allows me to get the power of a number like this: a = 2 ** 10 # 1024 Lets try it for C++: Doesn't work #include <iostream> using namespace std ; // does NOT work // operators.cpp:7: error: expected initializer before &lsquo;*&rsquo; token int operator ** ( int a , int b ){ int power = 1 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < b ; i ++ ) { power *= a ; } return power ; } int main (){ cout << 2 ** 10 << endl ; return 0 ; } I guess it doesn't work as it would be very difficult to distinguish something like this: a = a * * b ; a = a ** b ; If you try to use a $ you get: operators . cpp : 16 : 13 : error : invalid suffix \"$10\" on integer constant If you try to use a § you get: operators . cpp : 7 : error : stray & lsquo ; \\ 302 & rsquo ; in program operators . cpp : 7 : error : stray & lsquo ; \\ 247 & rsquo ; in program operators . cpp : 16 : error : stray & lsquo ; \\ 302 & rsquo ; in program operators . cpp : 16 : error : stray & lsquo ; \\ 247 & rsquo ; in program operators . cpp : 7 : error : expected type - specifier before & lsquo ;( & rsquo ; token You are also not allowed to redefine * : operators . cpp : 7 : error : & lsquo ; int operator * ( int , int ) & rsquo ; must have an argument of class or enumerated type Works You can wrap the integer like this: #include <iostream> using namespace std ; typedef struct integer { int inner ; // constructor integer ( int i ) : inner ( i ) {} } Integer ; int operator &#94; ( Integer a , Integer b ){ int power = 1 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < b . inner ; i ++ ) { power *= a . inner ; } return power ; } int main (){ cout << ( Integer ( 2 ) &#94; Integer ( 10 )) << endl ; // outputs 1024 return 0 ; } See also A class for dealing with fractions - which includes 7 examples for operator overloading Operators in C and C++ The General Syntax of operator overloading in C++ . sbi, Stack Overflow.

Versioning LaTeX-files is much better than versioning Word-files, as LaTeX is line-based. Versioning is my way to solve the following problems: Dead end : Once in a while I stuck while writing. I tried to improve some part of the documentation, but it didn't work. So I want to jump back. It is much more convenient to jump back in a versioning system than to press CTRL + Z often or to create copies of the old version. Versioning : This might sound strange, but versioning was a problem for me as I wrote my \"Facharbeit\" (a thesis you have to write in Germany at the end of secondary school). I had so many backups that I didn't know what was the original. If you use a versioning system, you can have everything in one place. Simpler collaboration : Some weeks ago I had to prepare a presentation about graph algorithms with three fellow students. We just met once to decide how to split the project. After that, everybody could work on his part while everybody could see the progress. We had no need of merging the documents. (See GITHub-Repository ) Simpler proofreading : The proofreader can make a fork of the repository with the documentation and make changes on his copy. After that, the writer can make a diff and see if he wants to take those changes. You can't forget small changes of the proofreader (like a \",\" you forgot / you made too much) with diffs. Backups : I've been ultra-paranoid as I wrote my thesis for secondary school. I regularly sent a copy to my father per Email and I had at least two copies on different data storage mediums. I wouldn't have needed this if I used versioning with GITHub. (I trust in the reliability of the service GITHub offers) Accessibility : To open LaTeX, you only need a text editor. If you want to complie it, you have to get one of many free LaTeX distributions like TeX-Live. After compiling it you get a PDF. PDFs look always the same, so you don't have the problem of shifted margins. Speed : I can write mathematical formulae much faster with LaTeX than with Word. Professional look : You can quite often see if a presentation / documentation was written with LaTeX or with Word. I think the LaTeX-Documentations do look much more professional. Source Code Inclusion : You can include and highlight source code directly within LaTeX. No need for copy and paste (see How to print Source Code with LaTeX , How to print MIPS assembly code in LaTeX ) Great Visualizations : You can create great visualizations directly within LaTeX (see , How to draw a finite-state machine , Plotting function graphs with LaTeX and Complex LaTeX visualizations (Tikz) ) I guess some might not know what a diff is or how it can look like. diff is a program that compares text files. This is an example with two text files. Each of them has 100 paragraphs: moose@pc07:~/Desktop$ diff file1.txt file2.txt 127 ,128d126 < And here is another one. < 189c187 < Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

This post is about simple implementations of matrix multiplications. The goal of this post is to find out how easy it is to implement a matrix multiplication in Python, Java and C++. Additionally, I want to get to know how good these solutions are. The second post will be an implementation of the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication. Strassen algorithm does matrix multiplication in \\(\\cal O(n&#94;{log_2(7)+o(1)}) \\approx \\cal O(n&#94;{2.807})\\) instead of \\(\\cal O(n&#94;3)\\) .

The implementations I will post all scripts for this test and I've added a GIT repository , so feel free to test it on your machine. I am also happy if you post some of your solutions with running times ☺ I am quite sure that my Java and C++ code can be written much better. If you know how, please leave a comment. If you know other languages, you could create a script for these. I focus on Python, Java and C++ as they are very often used. I have implemented these three types of algorithms for this post: ijk-algorithm : This is a simple, straight forward implementation of a matrix multiplication. I've used the definition of matrix multiplication. I didn't use multiple threads. ikj-algorithm : just like the ijk-algorithm, but I've switched two of the three the for-loops. Library-functions : I always prefer libraries over self-implemented solutions. I think they are faster than anything I could come up with in a reasonable amount of time. If you post a solution, please consider these restrictions: Input : The input file should get passed with the parameter -i , e.g.: python -i 2000.in or java Shell -i 2000.in The standard value for the command line parameter -i should be \"2000.in\" (a \\(2000 \\times 2000\\) matrix) The user should not have to give the size of the matrix! The two square-matrices that should get multiplied are ... ... read from a text-file. ... represented like this: Every line of one matrix is one line in the text-file. Newlines are only \"\\n\". Every number is separated by \"\\t\". The both matrices are separated by one newline. Output : The result has to get printed to standard output. The result has to be formatted like the input (tabs for separation of number, \\n for marks a new line) The Tests I will check the speed of a multiplication of two big matrices following for Python, Java and C++ for all algorithms like this: time python scriptABC.py -i ../2000.in > result.txt diff result.txt bigMatrix.out The bigMatrix.out was produced by the Python ijk-implementation.

I was very astonished, that the library Boost is slower (actually MUCH slower) than my simplest approach was. Conclusion If I want to create a working piece of code in a minimum amount of time, I will always take Python. It has been very easy to solve this task with the given restrictions. But C++ is amazing when speed is important. It was astonishingly difficult to find working code examples for this task for Java and C++.

I'll explain them now and I'll give some usage examples. lambda A lambda creates an anonymous function , that means a function without a name. A lambda may have any number of arguments. Here are some examples for lambdas: f = lambda x : x * x print ( f ( 7 )) Output: 49 g = lambda x , y : x + y * y + abs ( x ) print ( g ( 1 , 1 ), g ( 1 , - 1 ), g ( - 1 , 1 ), g ( 10 , 6 ), g ( - 10 , 6 )) Output: (3, 3, 1, 56, 36) h = lambda myVar , anotherVar : set ([ myVar , anotherVar ]) print ( h ( 1 , 2 ), h ( 'a' , 1 ), h ( 'a' , 'a' ), h ( 1 , 1 )) Output: (set([1, 2]), set(['a', 1]), set(['a']), set([1])) Sometimes you would like to get an if-statement in a lambda. So imagine you would like to make a lambda function like this: def f ( x ): if x == 0 : return 42 elif x == 1 : return 1337 else : return 0 This is the way you would do it: f = lambda x : x == 0 and 42 or x == 1 and 1337 or 0 (Thanks to Ikke's blog for the hint!) map(function, sequence) Map is a function with two parameters. The first parameter is another function, the second is a sequence. Map returns a list. It only applies function to every item of the sequence. Here are some examples: def square ( x ): return x * x l = map ( square , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]) l = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] This is equivalent to: l = map ( lambda x : x * x , range ( 1 , 11 )) You can also use more than one list: a = range ( - 10 , 10 ) b = range ( 0 , 20 ) l = map ( lambda x , y : x * y , a , b ) Output: [0, -9, -16, -21, -24, -25, -24, -21, -16, -9, 0, 11, 24, 39, 56, 75, 96, 119, 144, 171] reduce(function, sequence) You can quite often reduce problems to an operation on two elements. Reduce takes two elements from sequence, uses function on them and saves the result. Then it takes the result and another element of the sequence and uses function... Example: Imagine you would like to get the sum of a list. Then you need to add two elements of the list, save the result and add another element, save the result, add another element, ... r = reduce ( lambda x , y : x + y , [ 1 , 2 , 63 , 3 , 5 ]) r = 74 You can calculate the factorial n! like this: fac = lambda n : reduce ( lambda x , y : x * y , range ( 1 , n + 1 )) print ( fac ( 2 )) print ( fac ( 3 )) print ( fac ( 10 )) Output: 2 6 3628800 filter(function, sequence) filter gets all elements from sequence, where function returns true: def is_prime ( element ): if element == 2 : return True elif element <= 1 or element % 2 == 0 : return False else : for i in range ( 3 , element , 2 ): if element % i == 0 : return False return True my_list = [ 4 , 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 11 ] r = filter ( is_prime , my_list ) r = [13, 2, 7, 11, 11] Some more examples Task: What is the sum of digits of \\(2&#94;n, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) ? sumOfDigits = lambda exp : reduce ( lambda x , y : x + y , map ( lambda x : int ( x ), str ( 2 ** exp )) ) print ( sumOfDigits ( 2 )) print ( sumOfDigits ( 3 )) print ( sumOfDigits ( 4 )) print ( sumOfDigits ( 10000 )) Output: 4 8 7 13561 Task: Encode and decode a string in the following way: Split Words by spaces.

Es wird auch kurz erwähnt, dass es auf dem Mond keine Atmosphäre geben kann. Warum ist das so? Die kurze Antwort Der Mond ist leicht. Er übt deshalb eine weitaus geringere Anziehungskraft aus, als die Erde. Deshalb ist die Geschwindigkeit, die benötigt wird um den Mond zu verlassen auch um einiges niedriger als die Fluchtgeschwindigkeit der Erde. Gleichzeitig ist es auf dem Mond sehr heiß, die einzelnen Gas-Teilchen bewegen sich also sehr schnell. Das bedeutet, sie können den Mond verlassen. Die lange Antwort Definitionen und Größen Die Atmosphäre bezeichnet die gasförmige Hülle um einen Himmelskörper. Die Fluchtgeschwindigkeit Der Mond hat Temperaturen von bis zu 130 °C. Das sind 403,15 Kelvin. Die Masse des Mondes beträgt \\(7,349 \\cdot 10&#94;{22} kg\\) , der Radius beträgt 1738 km. Die Atommasse von Sauerstoff beträgt \\(15,999 u\\) .

So I will describe some special features of Python which make it much easier to quickly implement algorithms. I also made drafts how the tasks would be solved in most programming languages. When I say most, I mean most languages that are widely spread (so C/C++/Java is much more important than almost any other languages combined). I know that those tasks would be solved completely different in functional programming languages. Rapid, readable programming Intuitive looping through lists You can loop through every list-like datastructure like this: for element in list : print ( element ) Arbitrary Integer size Description : Print the sum of the digits of \\(2&#94;{100000}\\) . Java : import java.math.BigInteger ; public class test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { BigInteger a = new BigInteger ( \"2\" ); a = a . pow ( 100000 ); int sum = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < a . toString (). length (); i ++) { sum += a . toString (). charAt ( i ); } System . out . println ( sum ); } } Python : (was much faster in both computation and programming time!) big = 2 ** 100000 sumOfDigits = 0 for digit in str ( big ): sumOfDigits += int ( digit ) print ( sumOfDigits ) Python has no need for a special class as it has arbitrary length integers (see source ) Swich values of variables Description : You want to make sure, that variable a is smaller than b ( \\(a < b\\) ). Most languages : tmp = a a = min ( a , b ) b = max ( tmp , b ) Python : a , b = min ( a , b ), max ( a , b ) Return more than one variable Description : Evaluate \\(f: \\mathbb{R}&#94;2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}&#94;3, f(x, y) := (x&#94;2, y&#94;2, x+y)\\) Most languages : double function ( double x , double y ) { double returnValues [ 3 ]; returnValues [ 0 ] = x * x ; returnValues [ 1 ] = y * y ; returnValues [ 2 ] = x + y ; return returnValues ; } double values [ 3 ] = function ( 4 , 5 ); printf ( \"Part 1: %.2f \" , values [ 0 ]); printf ( \"Part 3: %.2f \" , values [ 2 ]); Python : def function ( x , y ): return ( x * x , y * y , x + y ) a , b , c = function ( 4 , 5 ) print ( \"Part 1: %.2f \" % a ) print ( \"Part 3: %.2f \" % b ) This is called \"Argument Unpacking\". In fact it does return only one variable (a tuple), but it creating the tuple is so easy that it does not feel like creating another variable. Short initialisation Description : Get a string representation of a list from the standard library Java : import java.util.LinkedList ; import java.util.List ; public class test { public static void main ( String [] args ) { List < Integer > myList = new LinkedList < Integer >(); myList . add ( 1 ); myList . add ( 3 ); myList . add ( 3 ); myList . add ( 7 ); System . out . println ( myList ); } } Python : myList = [ 1 , 3 , 3 , 7 ] print ( myList ) Both get the same result. Chaining Comparisons Description: You would like to check if \\(x \\in [-5, 42]\\) . Most languages : if (- 5 <= x & amp ;& amp ; x <= 42 ) Python : if - 5 <= x <= 42 : Enumeration Description : You have a list and you would like to print it, prefixed with the index in the list. Java : List myList = ( List initialisation and assignment , multiple lines ) int i = 0 ; for ( int element : myList ) { System . out . printf ( \"%i: %i\" , i , element ); i ++; } Python : myList = [ 1 , 3 , 3 , 7 ] for nr , element in enumerate ( myList ): print ( \" %i : %i \" % ( nr , element )) Named String formatting Python allows you to give parameters names: print ( \"The %(foo)s is %(bar)i .\" % { 'foo' : 'answer' , 'bar' : 42 }) any() and all() Description : You have a very long list and you want to know, if a prime is in this list. Most languages : List myList = ( List initialisation and assignment of many values ) boolean isPrimePresent = false ; for ( int element : myList ) { if ( isPrime ( element )) { isPrimePresent = true ; break ; } } if (! isPrimePresent ) { System . out . println ( \"The list did not containe a prime.\" ); } Python : myList = [ 4 , 4 , 9 , 12 ] if not any ( isPrime ( x ) for x in myList ): print ( \"The list did not contain a prime\" ) See also: StackOverflow answer from steveha .

You can easily see that it has 32 bits. As one bit may have two values - 0 or 1 - there are \\(2&#94;{32} = 4,294,967,296 \\approx 4.3 \\cdot 10&#94;9\\) possible addresses. The internet needs IP-addresses to know which information should be sent to whom. So only 4.3 billion devices can be connected to the internet. Devices are home computers (your PCs), servers (of big companies like Google or Facebook), Smartphones. So we are currently getting out of addresses. To solve this problem, IPv6 was introduced. Pure Numbers IPv6 has 128 bit. This means there are the number of addresses is: \\(2&#94;{128} = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 \\approx 3.4 \\cdot 10&#94;{38}\\) Quite a lot. Playing with numbers Imagine the world had 10 billion people ( \\(10,000,000 = 10 \\cdot 10&#94;9 = 10&#94;{10}\\) ). Imagine everyone bought 6 smartphones, 5 computers, 1 car, 4 tablet, 4 car radios in every year. That would be 20 internet devices for every person every year. Now you could give every device a unique address for much, much more than billion billion years! The sun is going to get a red giant in about 4 billion years, so this is nothing we have to worry about.

If you compile it with no optimization, you might get 43: $ gcc -O0 cpuzzle-1.c ; ./a.out aufgabe-3.c: In function & lsquo ; f & rsquo ; : aufgabe-3.c:5: warning: function returns address of local variable x = 43 x = 43 If you compile it with 03 Optimization, you might get 5. $ gcc -O3 cpuzzle-1.c ; ./a.out aufgabe-3.c: In function & lsquo ; f & rsquo ; : aufgabe-3.c:5: warning: function returns address of local variable x = 5 x = 5 Long answer The general answer Lets analyse this code line by line. Line 3 - 7 is a function f that returns a pointer to an integer. The pointer points to a local variable. As far as I know it is not defined what value should be there after you leave the function (has anybody a source for that?). The variable is a so called local or automatic variable and is located on the stack frame. Line 9 - 14 is a function g that doesn't take any parameter and doesn't return anything. This function should not have any influence on the behavior of the program. It puts 42 on the stack and increases it by one. Line 17 calls f and stores the returned function pointer in the variable x. Line 18 calls g. Remember that g should not have any influence on the other program. But you saved a pointer to a local variable which is not in the scope of the main function. So g is allowed to use the space which was previously used by the local variable i in the function f. It uses this space for j = 42 and increases it by 1. So if you access the address of the former variable i in f you will get 43. Actual assembly code You still want to get more into detail? Ok ... First you should get your assembly code. If you're running a Linux machine, you can type this into the console: gcc -S -O0 cpuzzle-1.c ; gcc cpuzzle-1.c -o cpuzzle ; mv cpuzzle-1.s cpuzzle-1-O0.s This will create a file called \"cpuzzle-1.s\" which contains the assembly code for the non-optimized version. Rename it into \"cpuzzle-1-O0.c\". Then the same for O3: gcc -S -O3 cpuzzle-1.c ; gcc cpuzzle-1.c -o cpuzzle ; mv cpuzzle-1.s cpuzzle-1-O3.s Now you can compare those two with meld or any other diff Tool: C Puzzle #1 - Assembly code part 1 The O3 code got an additional .p2align 4,,15 .p2align 4,,15 means: When allocating memory, align it such that each new section must start at a location with 4 0's at the end (i.e. a multiple of 16 bytes), except for if more than 15 bytes must be skipped. Quoted from MooseBoy It makes sense to store the data this way, as your computer can only access blocks. If one piece of data is half in one block, half in the other, you have to make to (slow) memory-accesses. C Puzzle #1 - Assembly code part 2 (the main) It is quite difficult to talk about it, so I made some annotations to this code. I have to admit that I don't know why the compiler does most of the optimizations ☹ C Puzzle #1, Assembly code part 1: Annotated C Puzzle #1, Assembly code part 2: Annotated You might also be interested in __printf_chk . An implementation is here . What you should have learned Never return pointers to local variables / variables in the wrong scope.

In computer science, a mask is data that is used for bitwise operations. Essentially it is a variable. They are very often used in C programs.

You can easily create visualizations of graphs and graph algorithms (if you have a template ;-) ). This post should give you a template to visualize graph algorithms with LaTeX. I recently found a great animation of Prim's algorithm done by Kjell Magne Fauske . I've edited his source files to show an eulerian path. This is how it looks like: LaTeX (Tikz) animation of an eulerian path This animation was automatically created. See Archive and the intermediate PDF . The ideas Draw the Graph If you want to visualize a graph algorithm, you should first try to get the image of the graph with Tikz. First include all packages / create the general structure of the document: \\documentclass [hyperref={pdfpagelabels=false}] { beamer } \\usepackage { lmodern } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } % this is needed for german umlauts \\usepackage [ngerman] { babel } % this is needed for german umlauts \\usepackage [T1] { fontenc } % this is needed for correct output of umlauts in pdf \\usepackage { verbatim } \\usepackage { tikz } \\usetikzlibrary { arrows,shapes } % see http://deic.uab.es/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/index_by_theme.html \\usetheme { Frankfurt } \\usefonttheme { professionalfonts } \\begin { document } \\begin { frame } Your content will be here. \\end { frame } \\end { document } Simple graphs could look like this: \\begin { figure } \\begin { tikzpicture } [->,scale=1.8, auto,swap] % Draw the vertices. \\node (a) at (0,0) { $ a ( this is text ) $ } ; \\node (b) at (0,1) { $ b $ } ; \\node (c) at (1,1) { $ c $ } ; \\node (d) at (1,0) { $ d $ } ; \\node (e) at (3,1) { $ d $ } ; % Connect vertices with edges and draw weights \\path (a) edge node {} (b); \\path (b) edge node {} (c); \\path (c) edge node {} (d); \\path (d) edge node {} (a); \\end { tikzpicture } \\end { figure } You should get something similar to this: Simple example graph created with LaTeX and Tikz Animate Animations can be created with Tikz by working with layers. You don't want to redraw the whole graph every time. Most of the time you want to overlay/underlay some parts of the graph. This can be achieved by declaring a new layer: \\pgfdeclarelayer { NAME } Then you need to tell PGF which layers are to use in the next figure: \\pgfsetlayers { LAYER LIST } The layer main should always be part of the list. Here is an example: \\pgfdeclarelayer { background } \\pgfdeclarelayer { foreground } \\pgfsetlayers { background,main,foreground } Now the magic begins.

So quite a lot tried to solve a problem, but couldn't even solve one. I think these problems were much harder than the ones from Round 1A 2012 . Problem 1 ( Safety in Numbers ): Small Set: 2695/5614 users (48%) Large Set: 2016/2686 users (75%) Problem 2 ( Tide Goes In, Tide Goes Out ): Small Set: 684/894 users (77%) Large Set: 620/671 users (92%) Problem 3 ( Equal Sums ): Small Set: 2261/2534 users (89%) Large Set: 149/854 users (17%) Safety in Numbers I tried this approach: X is the sum of all points given by judges. The visitors have an equal amount of points to give. \\(P_i\\) is the number of total points of contestant i. \\(J_i\\) is the number of points of contestant i by the judges. \\(V_i\\) is the percentage of the visitors points contestant i gets. So: \\(P_i = J_i + V_i * X\\) You don't know \\(V_i\\) and \\(P_i\\) . You have to get the minimal value of \\(V_i\\) to guarantee that contestant \\(i\\) will not to be eliminated. So you have to create some kind of \"worst case\" for contestant i, if he gets \\(V_i \\cdot X\\) visitor-points. The worst case is that the minimum of all remaining visitors is as high as possible. So if you think of them as players, they will always try to get a equal number of points. If they can get an equal number of points, you can make these (in)equations: \\(average = (X - p_i)/(N-1)\\) \\(p_i + V_i \\cdot X \\geq avg + \\frac{1-V_i}{N-1} \\cdot X\\) \\(V_i \\cdot X - \\frac{1-V_i}{N-1} \\cdot X \\geq avg - p_i\\) \\(V_i X (N-1) - (1-V_i) \\cdot X \\geq (N-1) \\cdot (avg - p_i)\\) \\(V_i X (N-1) - X +V_i \\cdot X \\geq (N-1) \\cdot (avg - p_i)\\) \\(V_i X (N-1) +V_i \\cdot X \\geq (N-1) \\cdot (avg - p_i) + X\\) \\(V_i \\geq (N-1) \\cdot ((avg - p_i) + X)/(X (N-1) +X)\\) \\(V_i \\geq (N-1) \\cdot ((avg - p_i) + X)/(X ((N-1) +1))\\) \\(V_i \\geq \\frac{N-1}{X \\cdot N} \\cdot (avg - p_i + X)\\) Unfortunately, its possible that the other players can't get an equal number of points. So this approach is useless in this case. Here is an approach with an approximation, which also works for the large input set. #include <iostream> #include <cstdio> using namespace std ; int main () { int testcases , N , sum ; int s [ 1011 ]; cin >> testcases ; for ( int caseNr = 1 ; caseNr <= testcases ; caseNr ++ ) { cin >> N ; /** the sum of all points of all contestants*/ sum = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; i ++ ) { cin >> s [ i ]; sum += s [ i ]; } printf ( \"Case #%d:\" , caseNr ); for ( int contestant = 0 ; contestant < N ; contestant ++ ) { // approximate the minimum for each contestant double low = 0 , high = 1 ; // increase the accuracy 100 times for ( int j = 0 ; j < 100 ; j ++ ) { double mid = ( low + high ) / 2 ; double me = s [ contestant ] + mid * sum ; double remaining = 1 - mid ; for ( int k = 0 ; k < N & amp ; & amp ; remaining > 0 ; k ++ ) { if ( k != contestant & amp ; & amp ; s [ k ] < me ) { // the contestant k needs at least // this part of all audience votes remaining -= ( me - s [ k ]) / sum ; } } if ( remaining > 0 ) { low = mid ; } else { high = mid ; } } printf ( \" %.6lf\" , low * 100 ); } printf ( \" \\n \" ); } } Tide Goes In, Tide Goes Out This one could be solved with Graphs. You calculate one Graph, where every node is one cell. Every cell / node is connected to adjacent cells. Every cell has a value which is the time when you can enter them. After you've created the graph, you can make something like that: graph = createGraph ( floorHeight , ceilingHeight ) endReached = False nodesReached = [] while ( not endReached ): tmp = getMinimumAdjacentNode ( graph , nodesReached ) nodesReached . append ( tmp ) return maxTime ( nodesReached ) Equal Sums A trivial solution for the small one is to try every combination.

Installation Für die Installation von Java, Subversion (SVN), Eclipse und Checkstyle samt Dokumentation muss folgendes in der Konsole eingegeben werden: sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-source openjdk-6-demo openjdk-6-doc openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre-lib subversion libapache2-svn eclipse checkstyle checkstyle-doc Dann werden etwa 276 MB an Archiven heruntergeladen und 662 MB an zusätzlichen Packeten installiert. Bei meiner Internetverbindung (DSL 1000 ☹ ) hat das ca 40 Minuten gedauert. CheckStyle Siehe eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net mit detaillierten Installationsanweisungen . Subversive Siehe eclipse.org: Download Suversive . Diese Erklärung ist aber nicht so toll. Nach der Installation und dem Neustart von Eclipse muss man das \"Subversive Connector Kit\" auswählen. Kurz in der Konsole bash svn --version eingeben. Bei mir ist anscheinend Subversion in der Version 1.6.12 installiert. Also wähle ich \"SVN Kit 1.3.7\". Zuerst muss man den SVN Connector installieren: http://community.polarion.com/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/ Das macht man wie mit CheckStyle. Dann muss man Subversive installieren: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/subversive/0.7/update-site/ Auch hier macht man es wie mit CheckStyle.

Eine Spalte kann man direkt entfernen, wenn in der Spalte nur an einer Stelle eine 1 steht und diese 1 an einer ungeraden Zeile (1, ..., n) steht. Berechnung des charakteristischen Polynoms Das charakteristische Polynom einer Abbildungsmatrix A ist der Wert folgender Determinanten: \\(det(\\lambda \\cdot E_n - A)\\) , wobei \\(E_n\\) die Einheitsmatrix ist. Beispiel Siehe Wikipedia . Berechnung am PC Mit Wolfram|Alpha kann man das charakteristische Polynom berechnen und auch direkt die Eigenwerte . Wozu das Ganze? An dem charakteristischem Polynom kann man direkt die Eigenwerte ablesen. Existiert eine Basis aus Eigenvektoren für den Vektorraum, dann ist eine Matrix diagonalsiierbar. Wenn eine Matrix in Diagonalform ist, dann kann man damit besonders gut rechnen.

I hope you remember it. SVN svn co URL LocalTarget --username yourUserName Source: svn checkout svn up Source: svn update svn log -l 4 Source: svn log Updating the repository You can update a SVN repository with this command: svn up [ path ] If you need to execute the command often, you might want to define an alias. aliases are shorthands for long commands in the bash. To create a permanent one, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias swt = 'svn up /home/moose/Studium/SWT' Now you only have to enter \"swt\" to execute \"svn up /home/moose/Studium/SWT\". Nice diffs You can modify your config file: gedit ~/.subversion/config and change diff-cmd to meld . Compare revisions svn diff -r 63 :64 compares revision number 63 with revision number 64 with the tool you defined (see Nice diffs). Git Global configuration $ git config --global user.name \"Martin Thoma\" $ git config --global user.email info@martin-thoma.de $ git config --global color.ui true Nice diffs If you want a GUI for git diff , then you should do the following: Install meld: sudo apt-get install meld Got to /bin and create a Shell-Script called git-meld with the following content: #!/bin/bash meld \" $2 \" \" $5 \" Make it executable: chmod +x git-meld Add it to your git configuration: git config --global diff.external git-meld Enjoy this experience when entering git diff : Using Meld with GIT See also jeetworks.org for some other solutions.

NEVER change short URL Short URLs should live forever and never change. Preview Adding '?preview' should give you a preview of the URL The preview should be the default option. Only if the user actively deactivated that - which can be stored with a cookie - preview should not be shown.

It's a simple substitution cipher : #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def decode ( ciphertext , key = \"ynficwlbkuomxsevzpdrjgthaq\" , alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" ): dic = {} for i in range ( 0 , len ( key )): dic [ key [ i ]] = alphabet [ i ] plaintext = \"\" for l in ciphertext : if l in dic : l = dic [ l ] plaintext += l return plaintext if __name__ == \"__main__\" : testcases = input () for caseNr in xrange ( 0 , testcases ): cipher = raw_input () print ( \"Case # %i : %s \" % ( caseNr + 1 , decode ( cipher ))) A minimalistic python solution for this one was suggested by Niklas B. He makes use of Lambdas , str.translate() and str.maketrans() : #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import string as s testcases = input () key = \"ynficwlbkuomxsevzpdrjgthaq\" decode = lambda c : s . translate ( c , s . maketrans ( key , s . ascii_lowercase )) for i in range ( 0 , testcases ): print decode ( raw_input ()) Problem B: Dancing With the Googlers #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from math import ceil , floor def line2intlist ( line ): list = line . split ( ' ' ) numbers = [ int ( x ) for x in list ] return numbers def getDist ( points , isSurprising = False ): p = floor ( points / 3.0 ) trip = [ p , p , p ] if 3 * p < points : trip [ 0 ] += 1 if ( 3 * p + 1 ) < points : trip [ 1 ] += 1 trip . sort ( reverse = True ) if isSurprising and ( trip [ 1 ] == trip [ 0 ]) and trip [ 1 ] > 0 : trip [ 1 ] -= 1 trip [ 0 ] += 1 trip . sort ( reverse = True ) return trip def maxGooglers ( nrOfGooglers , surprising , p , points ): mg = 0 surp = 0 for pi in points : trip = getDist ( pi , True ) if ceil ( pi / 3.0 ) >= p : mg += 1 elif trip [ 0 ] >= p : surp += 1 mg += min ( surp , surprising ) return mg if __name__ == \"__main__\" : testcases = input () for caseNr in xrange ( 0 , testcases ): originalList = line2intlist ( raw_input ()) nrOfGooglers = originalList [ 0 ] surprising = originalList [ 1 ] p = originalList [ 2 ] points = originalList [ 3 :] print ( \"Case # %i : %i \" % ( caseNr + 1 , maxGooglers ( nrOfGooglers , surprising , p , points ))) Problem C: Recycled Numbers The small dataset of this one was easy, but I had to change my code a bit to make it work for the large dataset. Sadly, I didn't know that I only have 8 minutes to get it work ☹ I've tried cPickle for the 2,000,000 list. It took 128.7 MB and 1 minute 6.287s for the large data set after it was pickled. Without pickling it took 1 minute 31.900s. #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- try : import cPickle as pickle except : import pickle def line2intlist ( line ): list = line . split ( ' ' ) numbers = [ int ( x ) for x in list ] return numbers def binomialCoefficient ( n , k ): if k < 0 or k > n : return 0 if k > n - k : # take advantage of symmetry k = n - k c = 1 for i in range ( k ): c = c * ( n - ( k - ( i + 1 ))) c = c // ( i + 1 ) return c #return n * (n - 1) / 2 def rot ( num , rot ): num = str ( num ) num = num [ len ( num ) - rot : len ( num )] + num [ 0 : len ( num ) - rot ] return int ( num ) def getRotList ( num ): \"\"\" Only return bigger rotated ones \"\"\" rotList = [ num ] for i in xrange ( 1 , len ( str ( num ))): tmp = rot ( num , i ) if tmp not in rotList and len ( str ( tmp )) == len ( str ( num )): rotList . append ( tmp ) return sorted ( rotList ) def inBorder ( rotations , A , B ): count = 0 for el in rotations : if A <= el and el <= B : count += 1 return count def recycled ( A , B , liste ): pairs = 0 minList = range ( 0 , B + 1 ) for tmpList in liste [ A : B + 1 ]: if minList [ tmpList [ 0 ]]: nrInBorder = inBorder ( tmpList , A , B ) pairs += binomialCoefficient ( nrInBorder , 2 ) minList [ tmpList [ 0 ]] = 0 return pairs if __name__ == \"__main__\" : liste = [] try : liste = pickle . load ( open ( \"save.p\" , \"rb\" )) except IOError : for i in xrange ( 0 , 2000001 ): tmp = getRotList ( i ) liste . append ( tmp ) pickle . dump ( liste , open ( \"save.p\" , \"wb\" )) testcases = input () for caseNr in xrange ( 0 , testcases ): A , B = line2intlist ( raw_input ()) print ( \"Case # %i : %i \" % ( caseNr + 1 , recycled ( A , B , liste ))) Problem D: Hall of Mirrors This one was very hard. I had some ideas, but none of them seemed to work. This is a solution based on the solution of \"dwenzel\". At the moment, I've only made some comments and broke some lines to let them fit into my blog. This solution needs about 2 minutes 42 seconds for the small input set and 2 minutes 12 seconds for the large input set.

Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. Today, I would like to discuss problem 142. I've seen a post from Santiago Alessandri , so I liked to do the task by myself. The task is: Find the smallest x + y + z with integers \\(x > y > z > 0\\) such that x + y, x - y, x + z, x - z, y + z, y - z are all perfect squares. I don't want to post the solution (if you want to cheat, I guess you could easily Google it), but some thoughts that might help you to get in the right direction. First thought: Brute-force Brute-force is the easiest way that could give you the solution. So I wrote this piece of code: #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import sys from math import sqrt def is_square ( integer ): root = sqrt ( integer ) if int ( root + 0.5 ) ** 2 == integer : return True else : return False for x in xrange ( 3 , 1000 ): print x for y in xrange ( 2 , x ): for z in xrange ( 1 , y ): if ( x > y and y > z ): if ( is_square ( x + y ) and is_square ( x - y ) and is_square ( x + z ) and is_square ( x - z ) and is_square ( y + z ) and is_square ( y - z )): print ( \" %i - %i - %i \" % ( x , y , z )) sys . exit () This is quite fast until you reach about 500. So this is not a good way to solve it. Apply some math You can formalize the task like this: Find the smallest \\(x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) , so that: \\(x > y > z > 0\\) \\(a = x + y\\) \\(b = x - y\\) \\(c = x + z\\) \\(d = x - z\\) \\(e = y + z\\) \\(f = y - z\\) With \\(a, b, c, d, e, f \\in Squares\\) . Now you can make the following conclusions: \\(\\overset{A.1, A.2, A.3}{\\implies} a > b\\) \\(\\overset{A.1, A.4, A.5}{\\implies} c > d\\) \\(\\overset{A.1, A.6, A.7}{\\implies} e > f\\) \\(a > c\\) : \\(y > z\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x + y > x + z\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow a > c\\) \\(c > e\\) : \\(x > y\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x + z > y + z\\) \\(c > e\\) a is the biggest element (see B.1, B.4, B.6) \\(b < c\\) : \\(-y < z\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x - y < x + z\\) \\(b < c\\) c is the second biggest element (see B.7, B.2, B.5, B.8) \\(b < d\\) : \\( y > z\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow -y < -z\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x - y < x - z\\) \\(b < d\\) \\(d > f\\) : \\( x > y\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x - z > y - z\\) \\(d > f\\) I can't tell anything about the relationship between: d and e b and f b and e Lets conclude: Graph that visualizes the situation of the squares of Euler 142 You also know: \\(x = \\frac{a - b}{2} \\implies \\text{ (a - b) has to be even} \\implies \\text{a and b have the same parity.}\\) The same argumentation can be used for (c, d) and (e, f). \\(x > y > z > 0 \\land a = x + y \\implies a \\geq 5\\) . With this in mind you don't have to loop over three variables but only over two. This is much faster. As z is over 1000 you need it. My new script took about 1.5 minutes.

Just take a look at them. I've also included some video clips of funny individuals. Axoltotl Axoltol The axoltotl is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures. Some have indeed been found restoring the less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brain—restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished. The axolotl is therefore used as a model for the development of limbs in vertebrates.

Ubuntu does only provide TeX Live 2009. The latest one is TeX Live 2013. As Ubuntu doesn't provide the latest LaTeX-Code, I'll explain how to install it by yourself on an Ubuntu System. What is LaTeX? LaTeX is a document markup language. So with LaTeX you're able to write math formula like \\(\\sum_{i=0}&#94;\\infty \\frac{1}{2&#94;i} = 2\\) . The term LaTeX refers only to the language in which documents are written, not to the editor used to write those documents. In order to create a document in LaTeX, a .tex file must be created using some form of text editor. While most text editors can be used to create a LaTeX document, a number of editors have been created specifically for working with LaTeX. A number of TeX distributions are available, including TeX Live (multiplatform) and MiKTeX (Windows). When I write \"LaTeX\" I think of \"TeX Live\".

Sie ist abhängig von der Basis des Urraums und des Zielraumes. Formale Definition Eine Lineare Abbildung \\(\\Phi\\) muss folgende Eigenschaften erfüllen: \\(\\Phi: V \\rightarrow W\\) ist eine Abbildung \\(\\forall x, y \\in W : \\Phi(x+y) = \\Phi(x) + \\Phi(y)\\) \\(\\forall x \\in W : \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{K}: \\Phi(a \\cdot x) = a \\cdot \\Phi(x)\\) Sei V ein n-dimensionaler \\(\\mathbb{K}\\) -Vektorraum mit der Basis \\(B = \\{b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\\}\\) und W ein m-dimensonaler \\(\\mathbb{K}\\) -Vektorraum mit der Basis \\(C = \\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_m\\}\\) . Sei \\(\\Phi:V \\rightarrow W\\) eine lineare Abbildung. Dann ordnen wir der linearen Abbildung \\(\\Phi\\) in folgender Weise eine Matrix A zu: \\(\\Phi (b_k) = \\sum_{i=1}&#94;{m} a_{ik}c_i, ~~ k = 1, ..., n, ~~ a_{ik}\\in \\mathbb{K}\\) Dann gilt: \\(\\Phi(x) = A \\cdot x ~~~\\text{ mit } x \\in V\\) Diese Matrix A nennt man Abbildungsmatrix . Beispiele Sei \\(\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}&#94;4 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}&#94;3\\) . Nullzeile \\(A_1 = \\left . \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\\\5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\end{pmatrix} }_\\text{dim V} \\right \\} \\text{dim W}\\) Standardbasis Sei \\(B_S = ( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} )\\) und \\(C_S = ( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} )\\) Also sind B und C die geordnete Standardbasis des \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;4\\) bzw. des \\(\\mathbb{R}&#94;3\\) . Was macht nun eine Abbildung \\(\\Phi\\) mit der Matrix \\(A_1\\) ? Ich denke ist ist leicht ersichtlich, dass bei einer Abbildungsmatrix dieser Form die erste Komponente des Bildvektors immer 0 ist. \\(\\Phi_1( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} ) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 70 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) \\(\\Phi_1( \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 7 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} ) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 18 \\\\ 54 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) Andere Basis Sei \\(B_1 = ( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} )\\) und \\(C_1 = ( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix} )\\) Auch hier schauen wir uns wieder die Abbildung \\(\\Phi\\) mit der Abbildungsmatrix \\(A_1\\) an. \\(\\Phi_1(\\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} }_\\text{in Basis C}) = A_1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 70 \\end{pmatrix} }_\\text{in Basis B}\\) Auch hier ist also die erste Komponente jedes Bildvektors 0. Allerdings haben die Bildvektoren nun eine andere Basis. Sie werden sozusagen anders interpretiert. Nullspalte \\(A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\0 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\0 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{pmatrix} \\) Nun mal wieder zwei Beispiel-Abbildungen: \\(\\Phi_2( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} ) = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 47 \\\\ 74 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) \\(\\Phi_2( \\begin{pmatrix} 100 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} ) = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 47 \\\\ 74 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) Wenn die Abbildungsmatrix eine Nullspalte hat, ist es egal was der abzubildende Vektor als Eintrag an dieser Stelle hat. Basiswechsel bei Abbildungen Ich habe ja gerade veranschaulicht, dass bei einem Basiswechsel zwar die Abbildung gleich bleibt, es aber dennoch unterschiedliche Vektoren sind. Sie müssen halt unterschiedlich interpretiert werden. Nun könnte man die Abbildung, also insbesondere die Matrix, so ändern, dass die Vektoren, die man als \"gleich\" interpretieren würde, gleich abgebildet werden. Wir suchen also eine neue Abbildungsmatrix \\(A_1'\\) , die die gleiche Abbildung beschreibt wie \\(A_1\\) mit den Standardbasen, nur von \\(B_1\\) nach \\(C_1\\) . Wenn man das machen will, kann man sich den Vorgang wie eine Ansammlung von Funktionen (im Sinne der Informatik) betrachten. Wir haben eine Funktion, die die Abbildung von der Standardbasis in die Standardbasis beschreibt. Als Input bekommen wir einen Vektor in der Basis \\(B_1\\) und herauskommen soll ein Vektor in der Basis \\(C_1\\) . Wir müssen also den Input-Vektor von der Basis \\(B_1\\) in die Standardbasis umwandeln und den Output-Vektor der gegebenen Funktion von der Standardbasis in die Basis \\(C_1\\) konvertieren. Dazu bestimmen wir zuerst die Basiswechselmatrix \\(T_S&#94;{B1}\\) von der Basis \\(B_1\\) in die Standardbasis. Das ist genau die Basis selbst: $$T_{B1}&#94;S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 1 & 7 \\\\ 3 & 3 & 4 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 7 & 1 & 8 \\end{pmatrix}$$ (siehe alten Blogpost ) Und die Basiswechselmatrix \\(T_S&#94;{C1}\\) von der Standardbasis in die Basis \\(C_1\\) . Das ist das Inverse der Basis \\(C_1\\) : $$ T_S&#94;{C1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} -6 & -2 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 3 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$ Insgesamt sieht das dann so aus: \\(T_S&#94;{C1} \\cdot (A_1 \\cdot (T_{B1} \\cdot x))\\) . Da für die Matrixmultiplikation das Assoziativgesetz gilt, kann man das vereinfachen: $$ A_1′ = T_S&#94;{C1} \\cdot A_1 \\cdot T_{B1}&#94;S = \\begin{pmatrix} 110 & 156 & 93 & 195 \\\\ 10 & 16 & 3 & 15 \\\\ -50 & -72 & -39 & -87 \\end{pmatrix} $$ (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) Ein Test ob es stimmen kann: z.B. sind \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} _S = 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} _{B_1} $ und $ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 30 \\\\ 70 \\end{pmatrix} _S = 110 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + 10 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} -50 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 110 \\\\ 10 \\\\ -50 \\end{pmatrix} _{C_1}\\) \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 110 &amp; 156 &amp; 93 &amp; 195 \\\\ 10 &amp; 16 &amp; 3 &amp; 15 \\\\ -50 &amp; -72 &amp; -39 &amp; -87 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} _{B_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 110 \\\\ 10 \\\\ -50 \\end{pmatrix} \\) (siehe Wolfram|Alpha ) Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie man nur mit den Basen B und C und der Abbildungsmatrix \\(A_1'\\) wieder auf die Abbildungsmatrix \\(A_1\\) kommt. Ich habe auf Stackexchange mal nachgefragt, aber das ist nicht von Erfolg gekrönt gewesen. Anzahl der Abbildungsmatrizen Für jede lineare Abbildungen \\(\\Phi: V \\rightarrow W\\) (wobei V und W endliche Vektorräume sind) gibt es eine Abbildungsmatrix. Wie sieht dann die Abbildungsmatrix folgender Abbildung aus? Sei \\(V:= \\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}[t] | deg(t) \\leq 5 \\}\\) der Vektorraum aller Polynome in t mit reellen Koeffizienten und Grad \\( \\leq 5\\) . Sei \\(F: V \\rightarrow V\\) die Shift-Abbildung \\((Fp)(t) = p(t+1)\\) (Quelle: Matheraum.de ) Wenn V allerdings der \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\) und W der \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 3 \\mathbb{Z}\\) über jeweils den Körper \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\) sind, dann ist die Abbildungsmatrix eine 1x1 Matrix. Das eine Element dieser 1x1 Matrix kann zwei verschiedene Werte - 0 und 1 - annehmen. Selbst wenn W der \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 41 \\mathbb{Z}\\) wäre, würde es nur zwei verschiedene Abbildungen geben. Wenn V der \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 3 \\mathbb{Z}\\) und W der \\(\\mathbb{Z}/ 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\) ist, dann gibt es nur eine lineare Abbildung \\(\\Phi: V \\rightarrow W\\) (die Nullabbildung). Die Abbildungsmatrix \\( \\begin{pmatrix}1\\end{pmatrix} \\) bezeichnet keine lineare Abbildung \\(\\Phi\\) , da 2 in V ist, aber nicht in W. Es scheint also so zu sein, dass man im Allgemeinen nichts über die Anzahl der linearen Abbildungen sagen kann. Dies und das Zwei lineare Abbildungen können hintereinander ausgeführt werden, indem ihre Matrizen multipliziert werden: \\(\\Phi_1 : V \\rightarrow W, \\Phi_1(x) := A_1 \\cdot x\\) \\(\\Phi_2 : W \\rightarrow X, \\Phi_2(x) := A_2 \\cdot x\\) \\(\\Phi_2 \\circ \\Phi_1 : V \\rightarrow X, x \\mapsto \\Phi_2 \\circ \\Phi_1(x) := \\Phi_2(\\Phi_1(x)) = A_2 \\cdot (A_1 \\cdot x) = (A_2 \\cdot A_1) \\cdot x\\) Der Rang der Abbildungsmatrix entspricht der Dimension des Bildes der Abbildung.

Hier ein paar Hinweise zu den Abschlussaufgaben aus dem Forum. Dabei habe ich die Antworten von jgraf, mmohr und praktomat genommen. Allgemeines Was wir absolut nicht sehen wollen sind grosse Methoden, die verstreut über den ganzen Code diverse returns enthält. Eventuell sollte man diese Methode dann ohnehin in Hilfsmethoden aufteilen. Parameter: Die Anzahl der Parameter muss exakt stimmen. Sind zu überzählige Parameter vorhanden, muss ein Fehler ausgegeben werden. toString/equals: Sollte nur für Klassen geschrieben werden, bei denen es Sinn macht. Vor allem auf eins aufpassen: Wenn man equals überschreibt, dann sollte man auch hashCode überschreiben (siehe docs.oracle.com ) bzw, beliebige suche nach \"equals hashCode\"). Mir fallen spontan wenige Fälle ein, wo es keinen Sinn macht, equals()/hashCode() oder toString() zu überschreiben. Die Shell ist vielleicht so ein Fall, oder auch Utility-Klassen. Verbergt die tatsächlichen Typen, woimmer es möglich ist! Also z.B. private Map meineMap = new HashMap (); Frage: Dürfen Strings direkt im Programmcode stehen, oder sollten diese gesammelt am Beginn einer Klasse stehen? Antwort: Kommt darauf an, wenn Sie mehr als eimal verwendet werden, dann sollte man Konstanten daraus machen. Frage: Soll die Shell nur korrekte Werte an den eigentlichen LittlePraktomat übergeben, also alle Fehlerquellen bereits in der Shell-Klasse abgefangen werden oder soll der LittlePraktomat Exceptions werfen, die in der Shell dann gefangen werden? Oder soll beides gemacht werden? Antwort: Die öffentlichen Methoden einer Klasse sind deren Schnittstelle. In den Javadoc Kommentaren sollte stehen, wie diese Schnittstelle zu verwenden ist. Also welcher Art die Eingaben sein müssen und wie die Ausgaben aussehen. Wenn sich ein Aufrufer nicht and diese Vereinbarung hält, dann sollte die Methode der Schnittstelle eine Exception werfen (IllegalArgument, NullPointer, ...). Diese Exceptions sollten normalerweise nie vom Aufrufer gefangen werden. Sie sollen das Program kontrolliert zum Absturz bringen. Die Logik dahinter ist folgende: Wenn eine IllegalArgumentException (oder ähnliches) fliegt, dann wurde eine Schnittstelle falsch verwendet. Der Aufrufer der Schnittstelle hat aber vor dem Aufruf sicher zu stellen, dass alle Forderungen der Schnittstelle eingehalten werden. D.h. wenn eine solche Exception auftritt liegt ein Programmierfehler vor. Mit Hilfe des Exceptionstacktrace kann der Entwickler diesen realtiv bequem finden und beheben. Es ist also beides zu machen, die Shell (der Aufrufer) hat vor dem Verwenden der Praktomat-Schnittstelle sicher zu stellen, dass alle Eingaben korrekt sind. Sind die Eingaben falsch, dann wird eine Fehlermeldung ausgegeben. Die Praktomat-Schnittstelle schützt sich vor falscher Verwendung mit Hilfe von Exceptions. Tests Ihr müsst eine Tests.txt mit abgeben. Die ist wie ein Beispiel aufgebaut und sollt wichtige Eingaben / Ausgaben enthalten, die eventuell zu Fehlern führen könnten. Da ihr sie ja sowieso schreibt, könnt ihr euer Programm auch auf eure Tests.txt überprüfen. Ich habe mir dazu folgendes kleines Python-Script zum Vergleichen gebastelt und vergleiche dann den normalisierten realen Output mit hilfe von Meld mit dem erwartetem Output. Also folgendes in der Bash: python checkTests.py meld ../tmp/createdOutputNormalized.txt ../tmp/compareTo.txt Ihr müsst halt noch die Pfade anpassen. Abschlussaufgabe 1 Folgendes zum LittlePraktomat: Falls die Namen von Personen etwas anderes als Kleinbuchstaben haben (also z.B. Großbuchstaben!) soll ein Fehler ausgegeben werden. äöü müssen nicht als Kleinbuchstaben erkannt werden, a-z reicht. Abschlussaufgabe 2 Folgendes zu Othello : Wer sehr schnell die Aufgabe erledigt hatte (also noch am ersten Tag), dem fehlen hier eventuell ein paar Sachen. Habt ihr den hole-Befehl?

I don't want to paint my room the next time as it is too cold at the moment, but the holes were really ugly. I've added a photo of them. So I went to the next hardware store and asked what could be done. I thought I needed to use gypsum which is gray, so it wouldn't look very good. Additionally you can buy gypsum only in 1.5 kg bags. Situation before Holes in the ceiling The tools The guy at the hardware store suggested to use acrylic paint. So I did. These were the tools I needed: Acrylic paint : about 4.00 Euro some masking tape a putty knife Masking tape and putty knife Acrylic paint One special problem As I had a wall plug in my ceiling I needed to remove it before I could start. I could not simply push it into the wall (it didn't work, I've tried it). And removing this special wall plug isn't that easy. This is how it looks like in the wall: Wall plug So I tried to stretch it: Stretching the wall plug with the hammer didn't work Stretching the wall plug with a wrench worked ... ... kind of Filling the hole First you need to clean both holes so that the acrylic paint can stick. Then you have to use the masking tape to get a clean border: Use the masking tape You have to use the putty knife to get a clean, smooth surface with the acrylic paint. Maybe you need to fill the hole repeatedly with acrylic paint. As soon as the surface looks okay, you can stop. Now remove the masking tape and then wait some hours until the acrylic paint is dry. The time you have to wait depends on the acrylic paint you use, but mine is dry enough for painting after 4 - 6 hours. Situation afterwards Afterwards, it looks like this: Filled hole in the ceiling Hmm ... well ... it looks different when I look at it. I can barely see it as it's not that bright at the ceiling.

This is what they mean [6] : b: byte (8 bit) s: short (16 bit integer) or single (32-bit floating point) w: word (16 bit) l: long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating point) q: quad (64 bit) t: ten bytes (80-bit floating point) Simple example C-Code This program simply outputs #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"%i\" , 1337 * 42 ); return 0 ; } Assembly Now I compile it and I save the assembly code: gcc -S test.c ; gcc test.c -o test This gives me test.s (the assembly code) and an executable called \"test\". .file \"test.c\" .section .rodata .LC0: .string \"%i\" .text .globl main .type main, @function main: pushl %ebp movl %esp, %ebp andl $-16, %esp subl $16, %esp movl $.LC0, %eax movl $56154, 4(%esp) movl %eax, (%esp) call printf movl $0, %eax leave ret .size main, .-main .ident \"GCC: (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 4.4.3\" .section .note.GNU-stack,\"\",@progbits This is code of the GNU Assembler . I guess other assemblers might produce other code. Could anybody please give me an example of other assemblers? The first and most important thing you might notice is that neither \"1337\" nor \"42\" appear in the assembly code, but 56154 which is 1337*42. I didn't use any optimization options! You might also notice that constants begin with a dollar sign and registers (esp, ebp) begin with a percent sign. The following ones are called assembly directives. They tell the assembler what to do next. .file , .section , .size and .ident are such directives. .data might be the most well-known one and tells the assembler to store something in the data segment of the program. .LC0 is a label for the immediately following string. .globl indicates that the following label (in this case \"main\") is a global symbol. Line 14: I'm not quite sure why you need the 4. I thought the integer size could be the reason (see variable sizes in C ), but as I used a string it still worked. As I used a character, it disappeared. Further information objdump gives even more information!

Er wird mit PDA (pushdown automaton) bzw. NPDA (nondeterministic pushdown automaton) abgekürzt. Laut Wikipedia verwendet die Gleitkommaeinheit einen PDA. Dazu habe ich allerdings keine Quelle, das ist also mit Vorsicht zu genießen. Ein weiterer Einsatzzweck ist die Syntaxanalyse einer Tokenfolge. Das kann für Compiler oder Interpreter von Interesse sein. Definitionen Der Kellerautomat ist als 7-Tupel definiert: \\((Q, \\Sigma, \\Gamma, q_0, Z_0, \\delta, F)\\) , wobei Q: endliche Zustandsmenge \\(\\Sigma\\) : endliches Eingabealphabet \\(\\Gamma\\) : endliches STACK-Alphabet \\(q_0 \\in Q\\) : Anfangszustand \\(Z_0 \\in \\Gamma\\) : Initialisierung des STACK \\(\\delta: Q \\times (\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\varepsilon\\}) \\times \\Gamma \\rightarrow 2&#94;{Q \\times \\Gamma&#94;*}\\) . \\(F \\subseteq Q\\) : Menge der akzeptierenden Endzustände. Bemerkenswert ist hierbei, dass F leer sein kann. Dies ist möglich, da ein PDA auch durch leeren Stack akzeptieren kann. Die Zustandsüberführungsfunktion ist etwas umständlich beschrieben. Dort steht, dass jede Regel folgende Form hat: \\(\\delta(\\text{Zustand}, \\text{Eingabesymbol}, \\text{Stacksymbol}) = (\\text{Neuer Zustand}, \\text{Neuer Stack})\\) Die Konfiguration eines PDA ist ein Tripel \\((q, w, \\alpha)\\) , wobei \\(q \\in Q\\) : aktueller Zustand \\(w \\in \\Sigma&#94;*\\) : der Teil der Eingabe, der noch nicht gelesen wurde \\(\\alpha \\in \\Gamma&#94;*\\) : der STACK-Inhalt Ein PDA ist deterministisch \\(: \\Leftrightarrow |\\delta(q, a, Z)| + |\\delta(q, \\varepsilon, Z)| \\leq 1 ~~~ \\forall_{q \\in Q, a \\in \\Sigma, Z \\in \\Gamma}\\) . Anschaulich Du hast einen Kartenstapel (deine Eingabe, auf der du immer nur ein Zeichen lesen darfst), einen Stapel für Notizzettel, wobei am Anfang nur ein Notizzettel dort liegt und immer nur ein Symbol auf dem Zettel steht (dein Stack, der mit \\(Z_0 \\in \\Gamma\\) initialisiert ist), einen Zustand und eine Menge Regeln ( \\(\\delta\\) ). Nun schaust du dir in jedem Schritt die oberste Karte auf dem Kartenstapel an und legst sie weg. Des Weiteren schaust du dir deine oberste Notiz an und legst sie weg und überprüfst deinen Zustand. Aus diesen Informationen schlussfolgerst du, was du als nächstes machst. Du kannst dir aussuchen in welchen Zustand du gehen willst und was du noch auf deinen Notiz-Stapel tun willst. Du kannst auch einfach nichts auf den Notiz-Stapel legen. Beispiele Sei \\(L = \\{w \\in \\{0,1,2\\}&#94;* | w = 0&#94;i1&#94;j2&#94;j ~~~ i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}\\) \\((\\{q_0, q_1, q_2\\}, \\{0, 1, 2\\}, \\{1, \\#\\}, q_0, \\#, \\delta, \\emptyset)\\) mit $\\delta(q_0, 0, #) = {(q_0, #), (q_1, #)}, $ $\\delta(q_1, 1, #) = {(q_1, 1)}, $ $\\delta(q_1, 1, 1) = {(q_1, 11)}, $ $\\delta(q_1, 2, 1) = {(q_2, \\varepsilon)}, $ $\\delta(p, a, Z) = \\emptyset $ sonst. Der Kellerautomat akzeptiert durch leeren STACK. Aus diesem Grund legen wir am Anfang auch immer wieder # auf den Stack. Sonst würde der PDA zu früh akzeptieren. Da \\(|\\delta(q_0, 0, \\#) = 2 > 1|\\) ist dieser Kellerautomat Nicht-Deterministisch. Umformungen Akzeptierender Endzustand → leerer STACK Siehe Skript von Prof. Dr. Dorothea Wagner, S. 107. Gegeben sei ein Kellerautomat \\({\\cal K}_1 (Q_1, \\Sigma, \\Gamma_1, \\delta_1, q_0&#94;1, Z_0&#94;1, F_1)\\) der durch akzeptierenden Endzustand akzeptiert. Wir wollen einen neuen Automaten \\({\\cal K}_2 (Q_2, \\Sigma, \\Gamma_2, \\delta_2, q_0&#94;2, Z_0&#94;2, F_2)\\) der durch leeren STACK akzeptiert. Idee : Wir führen einen neuen Zustand \\(q_E\\) ein, bei dessen Erreichen wir den STACK leeren. Um zu verhindern, dass der STACK zwischenzeitlich leer wird, legen wir zu beginn das STACK-Symbol \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) ab. Formal : \\(Q_2 := Q_1 \\cup \\{q_0&#94;2, q_E\\}\\) , wobei \\(q_0&#94;2\\) der neue Anfangszustand von \\({\\cal K}_2\\) ist. \\(\\Gamma_2 := \\Gamma_1 \\cup \\{Z_0&#94;2\\}\\) , wobei \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) den STACK initialisiert. Die Menge \\(\\delta_2(q, a, Z)\\) für \\(a \\in \\Sigma \\cup \\{\\varepsilon\\}\\) und \\(Z \\in \\Gamma_2\\) sei durch folgende Bedingungen festgelegt: Sorge für die gleiche Anfangssituation: \\(\\delta_2(q_0&#94;2, \\varepsilon, Z_0&#94;2) = \\{(q_0&#94;1, Z_0&#94;1Z_0&#94;2)\\}\\) Falls der Zustand, das gelesene Zeichen und das STACK-Symbol im \"alten\" Automaten sind, dann wie gehabt: \\(\\delta_2(q, a, Z) = \\delta_1(q, a, Z) \\text{f&uuml;r } (q \\in Q_1, a \\neq \\varepsilon, Z \\in \\Gamma_1) \\lor (q \\in Q_1 \\setminus F_1, a = \\varepsilon, Z \\in \\Gamma_1)\\) Sorge dafür, dass die STACK-Leerungsregel aufgerufen wird, falls der Zustand akzeptierend ist: \\(\\delta_2(q, \\varepsilon, Z) = \\delta_1(q, \\varepsilon, Z) \\cup \\{(q_E, \\varepsilon)\\} \\text{f&uuml;r } q \\in F_1, Z \\in \\Gamma_2\\) Diese Regel leert den STACK: \\(\\delta_2(q_E, \\varepsilon, Z) = \\{(q_E, \\varepsilon)\\} \\text{ f&uuml;r } Z \\in \\Gamma_2\\) Leerer STACK → akzeptierender Endzustand Siehe Skript von Prof. Dr. Dorothea Wagner, S. 107. Gegeben sei ein Kellerautomat \\({\\cal K}_1 (Q_1, \\Sigma, \\Gamma_1, \\delta_1, q_0&#94;1, Z_0&#94;1, F_1)\\) der durch leeren STACK akzeptiert. Wir wollen einen neuen Automaten \\({\\cal K}_2 (Q_2, \\Sigma, \\Gamma_2, \\delta_2, q_0&#94;2, Z_0&#94;2, F_2)\\) der durch akzeptierenden Endzustand akzeptiert. Idee : Wir legen ein zusätzliches Symbol \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) auf den STACK. Wird \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) gelesen, ist der STACK noch nicht leer, aber man kann in einen akzeptierenden Zustand \\(q_F\\) wechseln. Formal : \\(Q_2 := Q_1 \\cup \\{q_0&#94;2, q_F\\}\\) , wobei \\(q_0&#94;2\\) Anfangszustand von \\({\\cal K}_2\\) ist und \\(F_2 := \\{q_F\\}\\) \\(\\Gamma_2 := \\Gamma_1 \\cup \\{Z_0&#94;2\\}\\) , wobei \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) Initialisierung des STACKS von \\({\\cal K}_2\\) ist und \\(\\delta_2\\) festgelegt durch: Zuerst sorgen wir dafür, dass \\(Z_0&#94;2\\) ganz unten im STACK ist: $$\\delta_2(q_0&#94;2, a, X) = \\begin{cases} \\{q_0&#94;1, Z_0&#94;1, Z_0&#94;2\\} & \\text{falls } a= \\varepsilon \\text{ und } X = Z_0&#94;2\\\\ \\emptyset & \\text{sonst} \\end{cases}$$ Dann wie gehabt: \\(\\delta_2(q, a, Z) = \\delta_1(q, a, Z) \\text{, falls } q \\in Q_1, a \\in \\Sigma \\cup \\{\\varepsilon\\} \\text{ und } Z \\in \\Gamma_1\\) Und am Schluss auch akzeptieren: \\(\\delta_2(q, \\varepsilon, Z_0&#94;2) = \\{(q_F, \\varepsilon)\\} \\text{ f&uuml;r } q \\in Q_1\\) . Dies und das Ein Kellerautomat mit zwei STACKs ist Turingmächtig. (→ Zweikellerautomat ) Ein NPDA erkennt genau die kontextfreien Sprachen. Ein PDA erkennt manche kontextfreie Sprachen, aber nicht alle. (Genauer: Deterministisch kontextfreie Sprache ) Zu jedem PDA, der eine Sprache L durch einen akzeptierenden Endzustand akzeptiert, kann ein PDA konstruiert werden, der L mit leerem STACK akzeptiert (und umgekehrt). Für jede Grammatik G in Greibach-Normalform gibt es einen PDA.

Problemen einzuordnen. Meist betrachtet man die Laufzeit- und die Speicherplatzkomplexität, aber es wäre prinzipiell auf Vorstellbar, dass man andere Kriterien nutzt. Ich werde in diesem Artikel mal kurz die in der Vorlesung behandelten Klassen vorstellen. Da es umständlich ist, werde ich im Folgenden nur noch von Problemen reden. Gemeint sind aber meist auch formale Sprachen und Algorithmen. Die Klasse P In der Klasse \\(\\cal P\\) sind alle Probleme, die mit einer deterministischen Turingmaschine in polynomialzeit lösbar sind. Das sind also alle Probleme, für die es einen Algorithmus gibt, der in \\(\\cal O(n&#94;i), i \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) ist. Wenn es allerdings noch keinen Algorithmus gibt, der ein Problem in polynomialzeit löst, kann das Problem dennoch in \\(\\cal P\\) liegen. Dann muss es einen besseren Algorithmus zur Lösung des Problems geben. Die Klasse NP In der Klasse \\(\\cal NP\\) sind alle Probleme, die mit einer nicht-deterministischen Turingmaschine in polynomialzeit lösbar sind. Das besondere an einer nicht-determinisitschen Turingmaschine ist das Orakelmodul. Es liefert einfach die Lösung. Wie es das macht, wissen wir nicht. Irgendwie geht es halt. Diese Lösung muss in polynomialzeit von einer deterministischen Turingmaschine verifiziert werden. Was liegt dann nicht in \\(\\cal NP\\) ? Das Orakelmodul hört sich so mächtig an, dass eventuell alle Probleme in \\(\\cal NP\\) liegen könnten. Weit gefehlt. Suchprobleme liegen häufig (aber nicht immer) außerhalb von \\(\\cal NP\\) . Das sind dann Probleme mit einer Fragestellung à la \"Gib eine optimale Tour durch eine gegebene Menge an Städten an\". Wenn das Orakel-Modul eine solche Tour liefert, muss der deterministische Teil noch schauen, ob es eventuell eine längere Tour gibt. Die wohl berühmteste Fragestellung der Theoretischen Informatik lautet nun: P vs. NP : Gibt es Probleme, die in NP liegen, aber nicht in P? Es ist wohl anschaulich klar, dass gilt: \\(\\cal P \\subset NP\\) . P vs. NP ist die Frage, ob \\(\\cal P = NP\\) oder \\(\\cal P \\subsetneq NP\\) . Oder nochmals anders formuliert: \\(\\cal NP \\setminus P \\stackrel{?}{=} \\emptyset\\) Die Klasse NPC Die Klasse der NP-Vollständigen Probleme ist echt in NP, also \\(\\cal NPC \\subsetneq NP\\) . Das besondere an \\(\\cal NPC\\) ist, dass jedes Probleminstanz in \\(\\cal NP\\) in eine Instanz eines beliebigen Problems in \\(\\cal NPC\\) umgewandelt werden kann. Das es ein solches Problem gibt, hat Cook 1971 mit SAT gezeigt. Cook hat also anschaulich folgendes gemacht: SAT ist in NPC Für alle folgenden Beweise, dass ein Problem in \\(\\cal NPC\\) liegt, wurde der Satz von Cook verwendet. Laut diesem Satz (dessen Beweis wahnsinning lang ist) lässt sich jede Probleminstanz von Problemen in \\(\\cal NP\\) sich in eine Instanz von SAT umwandeln. Es reicht also zu zeigen, dass sich eine beliebige SAT-Instanz I in eine Instanz I' des neuen Problems in polynomialzeit umwandeln lässt. Diese beiden Instzanzen müssen in folgender Beziehung stehen: Für I existiert eine Lösung \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) für I' existiert eine Lösung: Beweis, dass 3-SAT in NPC liegt Sobald man von einem Problem sicher weiß, dass es in \\(\\cal NPC\\) liegt, kann man natürlich auch etwas anderes als SAT verwenden. Im Bezug auf P vs. NP ist es vor allem interessant. Wenn ein Problem nicht in P, aber in NP liegt, dann ist sicher jedes Problem in NPC außerhalb von P. Also: \\(\\cal P \\neq NP \\Rightarrow P \\cap NPC = \\emptyset\\) . Warum? Angenommen es existiert ein Problem P für das gilt: \\(P \\in \\cal NP\\) \\(P \\notin \\cal P\\) \\(P \\notin \\cal NPC\\) Dann gibt es eine polynomielle Transformation von jeder Instanz von P in eine Probleminstanz von einem beliebigem Problem in \\(\\cal NPC\\) . Damit kann jedes Problem in \\(\\cal NPC\\) nicht mehr in \\(\\cal P\\) liegen, da sonst auch \\(P \\in \\cal P\\) . NPI, co-P und co-NP Formal gilt: \\(\\cal NPI := NP \\setminus (P \\cup NPC)\\) . Es sind also alle Probleme, die innerhalb von \\(\\cal NP\\) sind, aber außerhalb von \\(\\cal P\\) und noch nicht in \\(\\cal NPC\\) in \\(\\cal NPI\\) . Es ist also so eine Art \"Zwischenklasse\". Um es etwas anschaulicher zu machen, habe ich mal folgendes Bildchen erstellt: P vs. NP: Die Klassen P, NP, NPC und NPI im Überblick Bemerkenswert ist folgende Aussage: Im Fall \\(\\cal P = NP\\) ist auch \\({\\cal P} \\setminus \\{\\emptyset, \\Sigma&#94;*\\} = {\\cal NPC}\\) (siehe Nachklausur von 2007 / 2008, Frage 5). Warum stimmt das? Damit ein Problem \\(\\in \\cal NPC\\) ist, muss es nur eine polynomielle Transformation von jedem Problem in NP auf das eine Problem geben. Das ist offensichtlich der Fall, wenn man alle Probleme in NP in polynomieller Zeit lösen kann. In diesem Fall kann man das Entscheidungsproblem lösen und eine Ja-Instanz auf eine beliebige andere Ja-Instanz abbilden und analog Nein-Instanzen auf Nein-Instanzen abbilden. Da \\(\\emptyset\\) keine Ja-Instanz hat und \\(\\Sigma\\) keine Nein-Instanz hat, muss man diese herausnehmen. Formal gilt: \\(\\text{co-}{\\cal P} := \\{L \\in \\Sigma&#94;* | L&#94;C \\in {\\cal P}\\}\\) und analog \\(\\text{co-}{\\cal NP} := \\{L \\in \\Sigma&#94;* | L&#94;C \\in {\\cal NP}\\}\\) . Folgende Aussage finde ich dazu sehr interessant: \\(L \\in {\\cal NPC} \\land L \\in \\text{co-}{\\cal NP} \\Rightarrow {\\cal NP} = \\text{co-}{\\cal NP}\\) D-TAPE und N-TAPE Im Skript wurde das seltsam geschrieben ( \\(\\cal DTAPE\\) ). Ich habe so nicht mehr erkannt, dass es TAPE heißen soll. In der Klausur sollte man sich davon nicht irritieren lassen. Formal: \\(D-TAPE(s(n)) := \\{L | \\text{Es existiert eine determinitistische TM, die L mit Platzbedarf s(n) akzeptiert.}\\}\\) \\(N-TAPE(s(n)) := \\{L | \\text{Es existiert eine nicht-determinitistische TM, die L mit Platzbedarf s(n) akzeptiert.}\\}\\) Quellen und Material Theoretische Grundlagen der Informatik : Skript von Prof. Dr. Dorothea Wagner Die Bilder stehen hier zur Verfügung: Material zu den Komplexitätsklassen","tags":"German posts","title":"Komplexitätsklassen in der Informatik: Ein Überblick"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/konstruktion-der-chomsky-normalform/","text":"Dieser Artikel könnte inhaltliche Fehler beinhalten. Bitte lest euch die Kommentare durch. Die Chomsky-Normalform ist eine bestimmte Art, eine kontextfreie Grammatik zu formulieren. Dabei haben nur die Produktionsregeln eine festgelegte Form, alles andere ist wie immer. Die Chomsky-Normalform kommt bei dem CYK-Algorithmus, der das Wortproblem für kontextfreie Grammatiken löst, zum Einsatz. Jede kontextfreie Grammatik kann in Chomsky-Normalform gebracht werden. Die Chomsky-Normalform Das Besondere an der Chomsky-Normalform ist, dass alle Regeln der Grammatik \\(G (V, \\Sigma, P, S)\\) folgende Form haben: \\(A \\rightarrow BC\\) oder \\(A \\rightarrow a\\) . Dabei sind \\(A, B, C \\in V\\) und \\(a \\in \\Sigma\\) . Falls die Grammatik in der Lage ist, das Leere Wort \\(\\varepsilon\\) zu erzeugen, dann fügt man folgende Sonderregel hinzu: \\(S' \\rightarrow S | \\varepsilon\\) . Dabei darf S' niemals auf der rechten Seite einer Produktion stehen. Eine Eigenschaft der Chomsky-Normalform ist, dass jedes Wort aus \\(2 \\cdot |w| - 1\\) Ableitungen gebildet werden kann. (Falls das leere Wort gebildet werden kann sind es \\(2 \\cdot |w|\\) Ableitungen für jedes nicht-leere Wort und eine Ableitung für das leere Wort) In jedem Ableitungsschritt erhält man entweder ein Terminal, oder ein weiteres Nicht-Terminal. Konstruktion der CNF Aus einer Grammatik \\(G (V, \\Sigma, P, S)\\) kann mit folgenden vier Schritten eine Grammatik \\(G' (V', \\Sigma, P', S)\\) in Chomsky-Normalform (CNF) erstellt werden: Schritt 1 Immer wenn ein Symbol aus \\(\\Sigma\\) in einer Produktion steht, wird dieses durch \\(Y_a\\) ersetzt und eine neue Produktion \\(Y_a \\rightarrow a\\) zu P' hinzugefügt. Es ist somit sichergestellt, dass alle Regeln entweder nur Nicht-Terminale auf der rechten Seite der Produktion stehen haben oder \\(\\varepsilon\\) oder dass dort ein einzelnes Terminal steht. Schritt 2 Immer wenn mehr als zwei Variablen auf der rechten Seite stehen, werden diese durch neue ersetzt. Sagen wir es stehen rechts m Variablen. Dann führt man m - 2 neue Variablen ein, fügt diese zu V' hinzu, und macht aus einer Regel \\(A \\rightarrow B_1 B_2 ... B_m\\) die Regeln \\(A \\rightarrow B_1 C_1, C_1 \\rightarrow B_2 C_2, ..., C_{i+1} \\rightarrow B_i C_i ... C_{m-2} \\rightarrow B_{m-3} C_{m-3}\\) . An dieser Stelle ist sichergestellt, dass alle Regeln entweder nur ein oder zwei Nicht-Terminale auf der rechten Seite der Produktion stehen haben oder \\(\\varepsilon\\) oder dass dort ein einzelnes Terminal steht. Schritt 3 Nun wollen wir alle \\(\\varepsilon\\) -Übergänge entfernen. Um dies zu erreichen, suchen wir alle Regeln, die nach \\(\\varepsilon\\) abbilden, also von der Form \\(A \\rightarrow \\varepsilon\\) sind. Dabei streichen wir die Regeln \\(A \\rightarrow \\varepsilon\\) . Falls A nun nicht mehr auf der linken Seite auftaucht, streichen wir es überall aus der rechten Seite. Falls dabei eine Regel zu \\(B \\rightarrow \\varepsilon\\) wird, streichen wir auch diese. Das wiederholen wir so lange, bis keine \\(\\varepsilon\\) -Übergänge mehr vorhanden sind. Am Ende fügen wir die Regel \\(S' \\rightarrow S | \\varepsilon\\) hinzu, falls die Grammatik auf das leere Wort abbilden konnte. Nun ist sichergestellt, dass alle Regeln entweder nur ein oder zwei Nicht-Terminale auf der rechten Seite der Produktion stehen haben oder dass dort ein einzelnes Terminal steht. Allerdings kann es noch Kreise in der Ableitung geben, die man entfernen kann. Schritt 4 In diesem Schritt entfernen wir eventuell vorhandene Kettenregeln, also Regeln der Form \\(A_1 \\rightarrow A_2 \\rightarrow A_3 \\rightarrow A_u \\rightarrow A_1\\) . Diese findet man mit einer Tiefensuche. Dann ersetzt man alle \\(A_2, ..., A_u\\) durch \\(A_1\\) . Die Regel \\(A_1 \\rightarrow A_1\\) kann entfernt werden, da sie ja nichts ändert. Beispiele Die Sprache der Palindrome Gegeben sei folgende Grammatik: \\(G(\\underbrace{\\{S\\}}_{V}, \\underbrace{\\{a,b\\}}_{\\Sigma}, S, P)\\) mit \\(P = \\{S \\rightarrow \\varepsilon | a | b | aSa | bSb \\}\\) . Schritt 1 \\(S \\rightarrow \\varepsilon | Y_a | Y_b | Y_aSY_a | Y_bSY_b\\) \\(Y_a \\rightarrow a\\) \\(Y_b \\rightarrow b\\) Schritt 2 \\(S \\rightarrow \\varepsilon | Y_a | Y_b | Y_aC_1 | Y_bC_2\\) \\(C_1 \\rightarrow SY_a\\) \\(C_2 \\rightarrow SY_b\\) \\(Y_a \\rightarrow a\\) \\(Y_b \\rightarrow b\\) Schritt 3 \\(S \\rightarrow Y_a | Y_b | Y_aC_1 | Y_bC_2\\) \\(C_1 \\rightarrow SY_a\\) \\(C_2 \\rightarrow SY_b\\) \\(Y_a \\rightarrow a\\) \\(Y_b \\rightarrow b\\) \\(S' \\rightarrow S | \\varepsilon\\) Schritt 4 Keine Kettenregel vorhanden. Ergebnis Nun werden noch einzelne Nicht-Terminale durch die möglichen Terminale ersetzt und man ist fertig. Damit ist die Grammatik: \\(G_{CNF} (\\{S, S', Y_a, Y_b, C_1, C_2\\}, \\{a,b\\}, S', P'))\\) mit folgenden Produktionen P': \\(P' = \\{S \\rightarrow a | b | Y_aC_1 | Y_bC_2,\\) \\(~ C_1 \\rightarrow SY_a,\\) \\(~ C_2 \\rightarrow SY_b,\\) \\(~ Y_a \\rightarrow a,\\) \\(~ Y_b \\rightarrow b,\\) \\(~ S' \\rightarrow S | \\varepsilon\\}\\) Sie ist also nicht schöner oder einfacher geworden, hat aber eine bestimmte Struktur erhalten.

Dafür benötigt man im Wesentlichen sogar nur drei Schritte. Der Algorithmus Überflüssige Zustände streichen : Manche Zustände sind nicht erreichbar. Diese können offensichtlich gestrichen werden. Akzeptierende von nichtakzeptierenden Zuständen trennen : Alle akzeptierenden Zustände werden in eine Äquivalenzklasse gepackt, alle Zustände die nicht akzeptieren kommen in eine andere Klasse. Zustände trennen : Für jedes Zeichen des Eingabealphabets $\\Sigma$ schreibt man sich auf, in welchen Zustand der Zustand führt. Wenn zwei Zustände in verschiedene Klassen führen, werden diese getrennt. Dies wiederholt man so lange, bis man ein mal alle Zeichen aus $\\Sigma$ durchgegangen ist, ohne dass Zustände getrennt wurden. Beispiel Gegeben sei folgender Endlicher Automat A: \\(A = (\\{0,1\\}, \\{S, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\\}, S, \\sigma, \\{D\\})\\) mit folgender Übergangsfunktion \\(\\sigma\\) : Endlicher Automat mit überflüssigen Zuständen Es ist offensichtlich, dass I nicht erreicht werden kann. Da der Graph gerichtet ist, kann man schnell sehen, dass auch H und G nicht erreicht werden können. Algorithmisch kann man diese Zustände durch eine Tiefensuche bestimmen. Nach Schritt 1 haben wir also den Automaten \\(A_1 = (\\{0,1\\}, \\{S, A, B, C, D, E, F\\}, S, \\sigma, \\{D\\})\\) : Keine überflüssen Zustände im Endlichen Automaten In Schritt 2 erstellen wir also zuerst eine Äquivalenzklasse der Zustände: \\(\\{S, A, B, C, D, E, F\\}\\) . Die akzeptierenden Zustände werden von den nicht akzeptierenden getrennt: \\(\\{D\\}, \\{S, A, B, C, E, F\\}\\) In Schritt 3 gehen wir nun immer wieder die Zeichen \"0\" und \"1\" aus \\(\\Sigma\\) durch: In welche Klassen führt \"0\"? C wird also von \\(\\{S, A, B, E, F\\}\\) getrennt. Wir haben folgende Klassen: \\(\\{C\\}, \\{D\\}, \\{S, A, B, E, F\\}\\) \"1\" trennt nun \"A\" von \\(\\{S, B, E, F\\}\\) : \"0\" trennt nun \"S\" von \\(\\{B, E, F\\}\\) : Wir haben nun die Äquivalenzklassen \\(\\{S\\}, \\{A\\}, \\{C\\}, \\{D\\}, \\{B, E, F\\}\\) . Im nächsten Schritt sehen wir, dass \"1\" nicht mehr trennt und \"0\" auch nicht nochmals etwas trennt. Wir sind also fertig. Die Zustände B, E und F können zu einem zusammengefasst werden. Ich nenne ihn mal T (für Trash, da man in diesem Zustand niemals mehr akzeptieren kann).

What is ACTA? The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a trade agreement between the following states: United States: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo Australia: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo Canada: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo Japan: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo Morocco: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo New Zealand: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo Singapore: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo South Korea: signed 1 October 2011 in Tokyo European Union and 22 Member States: signed on 26 January 2012; final enactment into law is on hold pending a debate in the European Parliament in June 2012. Germany: not signed yet Cyprus: not signed yet Estonia: not signed yet Netherlands: not signed yet Slovakia: not signed yet Mexico: Switzerland: Those countries describe it as a response \"to the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works.\" It would create a governing body outside international institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or the United Nations. The scope of ACTA includes counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet. An official Summary of Key Elements Under Discussion published November 2009 states that \"ACTA aims to build on existing international rules in the area of intellectual property, in particular on the TRIPS Agreement, and is intended to address a number of enforcement issues where participants have identified that an international legal framework does not exist or needs to be strengthened.\" On 10 March 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the ACTA with 663 in favor of the resolution and 13 against, arguing that \"in order to respect fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy\" certain changes in the ACTA content and the process should be made. Who is for ACTA? Well, I guess the signing government and parliaments. I've also heard that MPAA is for ACTA ( source ). Who is against ACTA? Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Chaos Computer Club several pirate partys, e.g. the German Piratenpartei ( source ) And why? treaty will restrict fundamental civil and digital rights: freedom of expression communication privacy removal of \"legal safeguards that protect Internet Service Providers from liability for the actions of their subscribers\" in effect giving ISPs no option but to comply with privacy invasions See also Wikpedia: ACTA (big parts of my article are from this wiki-article) open letter 1 Save the Internet STOPP ACTA French MEP quits and slams ACTA process as ‘a charade'","tags":"My bits and bytes","title":"Stop ACTA"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/sprachen-automaten-und-grammatiken/","text":"Die folgende Tabelle gibt einen Überblick über formale Sprachen, die Automaten die sie akzeptieren und die Grammatiken, die sie erzeugen.

Aufgabe Finde eine Basis für \\(U_1 \\cap U_2\\) . Zusatzaufgabe: Finde eine Basis für \\(U_1 + U_2\\) . Basis finden Will man eine möglichst einfache Basis, also ein minimales Erzeugendensystem mit möglichst kleinen Zahlen zu einem gegebenem Vektorraum finden, so kann man das Gaußsche Eliminationsverfahren auf die erzeugenden Vektoren anwenden. Dazu transponiert man die Vektoren: \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c | c} 2 & 5 & 3 & 17 & 0\\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0\\\\ 1 & 3 & 3 & 7 & 0\\\\ -1 & 1 &-1 & 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\) Da im Gaußsche Eliminationsverfahren nur das Vertauschen von Zeilen, die Multiplikation einer Zeile mit einer Konstanten und die Addition von Zeilen zugelassen sind, bleibt die rechte Spalte immer Null. Sie kann also weggelassen werden: \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 2 & 5 & 3 & 17\\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 1 & 3 & 3 & 7\\\\ -1 & 1 &-1 & 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\rightsquigarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 1 &-1 & 1 &-1\\\\ 0 & 3 & 2 & 5\\\\ 0 & 4 & 2 & 8\\\\ 0 & 7 & 1 & 19 \\end{array} \\right) \\rightsquigarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 1 &-1 & 1 &-1\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & 2\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & -1\\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\frac{5}{2} & 5 \\end{array} \\right) \\rightsquigarrow $ $\\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 1 &-1 & 1 &-1\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & 2\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -2\\\\ 0 & 0 & -5 & 10 \\end{array} \\right) \\rightsquigarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 3\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -2\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\) Die Basis für \\(U_1\\) ist also \\(\\left \\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right \\}\\) Ich habe gerade keine Lust, das ganze für \\(U_2\\) noch vorzurechnen. Es kommt \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{29}{38}\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{49}{38}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\) heraus, siehe Wolfram|Alpha . Die Basis für \\(U_2\\) ist also \\(\\left \\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\frac{29}{38} \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{49}{38} \\end{pmatrix} , \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right \\}\\) Zassenhaus-Algorithmus Bemerkung: Ich habe für den Zassenhaus-Algorithmus leiter die falsche Basis genommen. Der Rechenfehler zieht sich bis zum Ende durch. Wenn ich mal Zeit habe, werde ich es korrigieren (Alternativ: Wenn es jemand von euch macht, kann er den TeX-Code ja als Kommentar bereitstellen). Man transponiert die Basisvektoren von \\(U_1\\) und \\(U_2\\) und schreibt sie in eine Matrix: \\(\\left( \\begin{array}{c | c} U_1&#94;T & U_1&#94;T \\\\ \\hline U_2&#94;T & 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\) .

It allows you to apply a very detailed search syntax. Every Linux user should know how to use it. Very basic usage \\( find /home -iname &#039;Tux*&#039;\" title=\"\\) find /home -iname 'Tux*'\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2671\" /> I told you I would start with the very basics, didn't I? So, you can need the option -iname if you want to do basic matching against the filename. The * can be used as a placeholder. Redirecting errors You might get some \"Permission denied\" errors. They are very bothersome if you combine commands in the bash. So you redirect them to /dev/null, a special file which discards everything it gets: Real life example I am also a developer who likes to have good names for constants, database tables and variables. Sometimes, like today, I think it's time to change a database table a bit. It got a lot more rows and the old name doesn't really fit any longer. I used a constant for the table name in all scripts. This constant was SOFTWARE_USER_TABLE and should now be USER_INFO_TABLE. So I have to search recursively and case-sensitive in my project and replace all occurrences in all strings by the new string. Except for .svn-directories, of course. The easiest way to achieve this is via find, xargs and sed: find . -path '*/.svn' -prune -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/SOFTWARE_USER_TABLE/USER_INFO_TABLE/g' Now the explanation of the different commands: find: .: search in the current working directory -path '*/.svn' -prune': If a directory starting with .svn is in the path to the file, skip it -o: atlernative (OR) -type f: only search for files -print0: print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the newline character that -print uses). This allows file names that contain newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the find output. This option corresponds to the -0 option of xargs. xargs -0: exchanges the arguments. -0 means that input items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special (every character is taken lit erally). Disables the end of file string, which is treated like any other argument. Useful when input items might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes. The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode. sed: -i: edit the given file in-place. If you would not use -i, it would just print everything in standard output /g: edit the file globally. If you would not use g, sed would only replace the first occurrence of SOFTWARE_USER_TABLE Snippets move all files in subdirectories to a single directory: find -type f -exec mv {} collection/ \\; find all files which are bigger than 20MB and print their location and size. Maybe you could use du for this one, but I don't know how: find / -type f -size +20000k -exec ls -lh {} \\; 2 >/dev/null | awk '{ print $5 \":\\t\" $8 }' find files in the home folder owned by alice: find /home -user alice Further reading Note that you should use grep if you want to search for patterns in single files. man page Wikipedia","tags":"Code","title":"Wandering through the depths of find"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/surprising-c-errors/","text":"Those errors might be surprising and a good exercise for C beginners: Empty printf #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf ( \"\" ); return 0 ; } error: zero-length gnu_printf format string Macros #include <stdio.h> #define MY_MACRO printf(\"Hello World\\n\"); int main () { if ( 1 ) MY_MACRO ; else printf ( \"Crazy, huh? \\n \" ); return 0 ; } macro.c: In function & lsquo ; main & rsquo ; : macro.c:8: error: & lsquo ; else & rsquo ; without a previous & lsquo ; if & rsquo ; Single and Double quotes #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf ( ' hello , world \\ n ' ); return 0 ; } macro.c:5:9: warning: character constant too long for its type macro.c: In function & lsquo ; main & rsquo ; : macro.c:5: warning: passing argument 1 of & lsquo ; printf & rsquo ; makes pointer from integer without a cast /usr/include/stdio.h:339: note: expected & lsquo ; const char * __restrict__ & rsquo ; but argument is of type & lsquo ; int & rsquo ; macro.c:5: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments Thanks to drpaulcarter.com for this example: int main () { const char * myPointer = 'A' ; ( void ) myPointer ; return 0 ; } macro.c: In function & lsquo ; main & rsquo ; : macro.c:3: warning: initialization makes pointer from integer without a cast Pointers #include <string.h> int main () { char * myPointer ; strcpy ( myPointer , \"Hello World!\" ); return 0 ; } macro.c: In function & lsquo ; main & rsquo ; : macro.c:7: warning: & lsquo ; myPointer & rsquo ; is used uninitialized in this function Loops int main () { int x = 42 ; while ( x > 0 ); x -- ; return 0 ; } No compiler error, but an infinite loop.

The OpenID Attribute Exchange makes registration processes simpler, as the user can automatically allow the website to get some information like the e-mail address, the gender and the full name. The next step to an even simpler login process would be autodiscovery. This means there would be no need to do anything for logging in. You simply have to go to the website and be logged at your OpenID provider (e.g. Google). This is quite easily possible if the user was logged in before. You leave a cookie that gives you the information which OpenID he uses. So you simply don't let him logout. I don't know if it is a good idea to do so. The registration process is much trickier. Due to the same origin policy , you can't read other cookies than those you have set. So you can't check if there is a cookie from Google, Facebook or Yahoo. You could try if the user has a Google account, as Google uses a discovery URL (https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id) instead of the usual OpenID (something like https://me.yahoo.com/martinthoma). So, by chance you will be able to let a user register without forcing him to interact in any way with your website. He has to allow your website to get his data at his OpenID provider, though.

You know the structures and the way you have to think if you want to solve a problem. The first time it might be hard, but the more languages you learn the more similarities you'll recognize. I also have to learn a special variant of pseudocode at the moment. It is quite hard to know what pseudocode does if it isn't unambiguously defined. I had problems with for loops for example. For loops have some properties you simply have to define: Scoping : Does the loop counter still exist after the loop was executed? Copy or reference : Does the loop statement work with a copy or with a reference of the variables in the loop body? Last value of i : What is the last value of i? General structure A for loop usually consists of an initialization part, a condition and an iteration step: The structure of a for loop. Pythons special structure Python uses a generator or lists to loop: #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- for i in xrange ( 0 , 10 ): print ( \"In loop: %i \" % i ) print ( \"Out of loop: %i \" % i ) Scoping Does the loop counter still exist after the loop was executed? Yes : JavaScript, PHP, Python No : C, C++, Java Copy or reference Does the loop statement work with a copy or with a reference of the variables in the loop body? Does the programming language use the same variable as in the for condition (reference) or does it use another one (copy)? You can test this if you add something to i in the body. Copy : Python Reference : C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP Python iterates over a generator. This means that you can't really compare Pythons for-loop to other programming languages' for loops. Last value of i What is the last value of i? 9 : C, C++, Java (Inside the loop), Python (Outside of the loop) 10 : JavaScript, PHP (Outside of the loop) foreach Many languages provide a special for loop. This special for loop is sometimes called \"foreach\" as you iterate over each element in a collection (e.g. an array). Java int [] array = new int [ 5 ]; array [ 0 ] = 0 ; array [ 1 ] = 1 ; array [ 2 ] = 2 ; array [ 3 ] = 3 ; array [ 4 ] = 4 ; for ( int item : array ) { System . out . println ( \"Foreach: \" + item ); } JavaScript var array = new Array ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ); for ( var value in array ) { document . write ( 'Foreach: ' + value + '<br/>' ); } PHP $array = array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4); foreach ($array as $key=>$value) { echo \"Foreach: $value<br/>\"; } Python array = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] for value in array : print \"Foreach: %i \" % value More information If you want to see the code, you can download this zip archive .

Aus dem Pumping-Lemma folgt: \\(\\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}: \\forall w \\in \\{w \\in L_2 | |w| \\geq n\\}: $ $\\exists \\text{ Darstellung } uvx = w \\text{ mit } v \\neq \\varepsilon \\land |uv| \\leq n\\) für die gilt: \\(uv&#94;i x \\in L_2 \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) In Worten: Wenn man ein Wort in L hat, dass mindestens so lang ist wie ein bestimmtes n, dann kann man dieses Wort in Teilworte u, v und x zerlegen. Bei dieser Zerlegung ist v niemals leer. Wenn man nun den Teil des Wortes, der in v steckt wiederholt, muss das Wort immer noch in \\(L_2\\) sein. Sei \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) die Konstante aus dem Pumping-Lemma. Betrachte nun \\(w = a&#94;n b&#94;{n+1} c&#94;{n+2}\\) . Offensichtlich gilt \\(w \\in L_2\\) . Da \\(|uv| \\leq n\\) muss in v mindestens ein a sein. \\(\\Rightarrow uv&#94;2 x = a&#94;{n+2 \\cdot i} b&#94;{n+1} c&#94;{n+2}, i \\geq 1 $ $\\Rightarrow uv&#94;2x \\notin L_2 $ $\\Rightarrow \\text{Widerspruch} $ $\\Rightarrow \\text{Die Annahme war falsch.} $ $\\Rightarrow L_2\\) ist nicht regulär. Bemerkung : Eigentlich ist es ein Beweis durch Kontraposition. Man weiß, es gilt: \\(L \\in {\\cal L_3} \\Rightarrow $ L erf&uuml;llt das Pumping-Lemma. Daraus folgt: L erf&uuml;llt nicht das Pumping-Lemma $\\Rightarrow L \\notin {\\cal L_3}\\) . Um zu beweisen, dass L das Pumping-Lemma nicht erfüllt, benutzt man meist einen Widerspruchsbeweis wie oben.

Generators help you to program iterators. They look almost like normal functions, but they have yield as a special keyword. yield is used instead of return. Imagine you wanted to display n Fibonacci numbers.

Of course, you could write something like this: #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- def fib ( n ): \"\"\" Calculate the n-th fibonacci number. \"\"\" if n == 0 : return 0 elif n == 1 : return 1 else : return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) for nr in xrange ( 1 , 100 ): print ( \"The %i -th Fibonacci-Nr is %i \" % ( nr , fib ( nr ))) This needs much less memory, but much more time.

Prinzip Der Gedanke hinter dem Induktionsbeweis ist, dass man sehr leicht für ein einzelnes Element zeigen kann, dass eine Aussage gilt. Diese Aussage ist die Behauptung. Dann zeigt man allgemein, wenn die Aussage für eine Zahl gilt muss sie auch für die nächste Zahl gelten. Wenn man also für n = 1 zeigt dass die Aussage A(n) korrekt ist, dann gilt sie für alle positiven Zahlen. Aufbau Induktionsanfang (I.A.): Zeige, dass die Aussage für ein bestimmtes $n_0$ (also z.B. $n_0 = 0$) gilt. Dafür muss man einfach nur einsetzen. Induktionsvorraussetzung (I.V.)): \"Sei $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ beliebig, aber fest und es gelte: \" Induktionsschluss (I.S.): Ausgehend von I.V. ist zu zeigen, dass die Aussage für $n_0 + 1$ gilt. Beispiele Identitäten Es gibt viele Identitäten, die sich gut mit einem Induktionsbeweis zeigen lassen: Bei den folgenden Identitäten sei \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) . Gaußsche Summenformel Behauptung : \\(\\sum_{k=1}&#94;n k = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1)\\) Beweis : durch vollständige Induktion I.A. : Sei n = 1. Dann: \\(\\sum_{k=1}&#94;1 k = 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1+1)\\) I.V. : Sei \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) beliebig, aber fest und es gelte: \\(\\sum_{k=1}&#94;n k = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1)\\) I.S. : \\(\\sum_{k=1}&#94;{n+1} k = \\sum_{k=1}&#94;{n} k + (n+1) \\stackrel{I.V.}{=} \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1) + (n+1) = $ $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (n&#94;2 + n) + (n+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (n&#94;2 + 3n + 2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (n+1)(n+2) \\blacksquare\\) Weitere $\\sum_{k=1}&#94;n k&#94;3 = \\frac{1}{4}n&#94;2 (n+1)&#94;2$ Fibonacci: $f(m+n) = f(n+1) \\cdot f(m) + f(n) \\cdot f(m-1)$ Binomischer Satz Das folgende habe ich als Mitschrift der Vorlesung \"Analysis I\" am KIT gemacht: Seien $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}.$ Dann gilt für alle $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$: $(a+b)&#94;{n+1} = (a+b)(a+b)&#94;n = (a+b) \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n} \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n-k} b&#94;k}_\\text{Binomischer Lehrsatz}$ I.A. : \\(n=1: \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{1}\\binom{1}{k} a&#94;{1-k} b&#94;k = (a+b)&#94;n\\) I.V. : Sei \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) und es gelte \\((a+b)&#94;{n+1} = (a+b)(a+b)&#94;n = (a+b) \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n} \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n-k} b&#94;k\\) I.S. : \\begin{align} (a+b)&#94;{k+1} &= (a+b)(a+b)&#94;n \\\\ &= (a+b) \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n} \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n-k} b&#94;k \\\\ &= \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n} \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n+1-k} b&#94;k + \\sum_{k=0}&#94;n \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n-k} b&#94;{k+1} \\\\ &= \\underbrace{\\binom{n}{0}}_{\\binom{n+1}{0}} a&#94;{n+1} + \\sum_{k=1}&#94;n \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n+1-k} b&#94;k + \\underbrace{\\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n-1} \\binom{n}{k} a&#94;{n-k} b&#94;{k+1}}_\\text{Vorbemerkung} + \\binom{n}{n} b&#94;{n+1} \\\\ &= \\binom{n+1}{0} a&#94;{n+1} + \\sum_{k=1}&#94;{n} [\\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1}] a&#94;{n+1} b&#94;k + \\binom{n+1}{n+1} b&#94;{n+1} \\\\ &= \\sum_{k=0}&#94;{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{k} a&#94;{n+1-k} b&#94;k \\end{align} Rekursive Folgen Der Grenzwert rekursiv definierter Folgen lässt sich häufig sehr schön mit mehreren Induktionsbeweisen beweisen. Finde für dich heraus: Ist die Folge monoton steigend oder fallend? ist 0 oder 1 eine untere / obere Schranke? gibt es andere untere oder obere Schranken? Beweise, dass du eine obere / untere Schranke gefunden hast Beweise, dass die Folge monoton steigt / fällt Mache den Ansatz: Sei $a$ der Grenzwert der Folge $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ mit $a_n = f(a_{n-1})$. Dann gilt: $a = f(a)$. Löse dann nach $a$ auf. Eine Folge in der das wunderbar klappt ist folgende: Sei \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) eine Folge und definiert durch: \\(a_0 = 2,~~~~~ a_n = \\sqrt[3]{a_n&#94;2+a_n-1}\\) . Strukturelle Induktion Bei der vollständigen Induktion iteriert man über eine natürliche Zahl und gelangt so, ab einer festen natürlichen Zahl \\(n_0\\) zu jeder beliebigen größeren natürlichen Zahl. Die strukturelle Induktion nutzt allerdings nicht direkt Zahlen, sondern strukturen. Man hat eine sog. \"Atomare Struktur\" bzw. \"Atomares Element\", also in einem gewissen Sinn das oder die kleinsten Teilchen, gegeben. Diese Teilchen erfüllen die Aussage. Nun zeigt man, dass aus den Atomaren Elementen alle Strukturen gebildet werden können, über die in der Behauptung die Aussage getroffen wird und dass die Aussage bei jeder neuen Struktur richtig ist. Insbesondere bietet sich die strukturelle Induktion bei komplexen Graphen, aussagelogischen Formeln und Wörtern an. Beispiele Voller, vollständiger Binärbaum Sei G(V, E) ein Binärbaum. G ist ein voller Binärbaum \\(: \\Leftrightarrow\\) alle inneren Knoten von G haben den Verzweigungsgrad 2 G ist ein voller, vollständiger Binärbaum \\(: \\Leftrightarrow\\) G ist ein voller Binärbaum und alle Blätter haben die gleiche Höhe Behauptung \\({\\cal B} (n)\\) : Jeder volle, vollständige Binärbaum der Höhe \\(n, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) hat \\(2&#94;{n-1} - 1\\) innere Knoten. Beweis : durch strukturelle Induktion I.A. : zeige \\({\\cal B} (1)\\) . Ein voller, vollständiger Binärbaum der Höhe n = 1 besteht nur aus einem Knoten. Er hat also \\(0 = 2&#94;{n-1} - 1 = 2&#94;{1-1} - 1 = 2&#94;0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\\) innere Knoten. I.V. : Für beliebige, aber feste volle, vollständige Binärbäume G der Höhe n gilt: G hat \\(2&#94;{n-1} - 1\\) innere Knoten. I.S. : zeige \\({\\cal B} (n+1)\\) Für jeden vollen, vollständigen Binärbaum der Höhe \\(n+1\\) gibt es einen Teilgraphen T, der ein voller, vollständiger Binärbaum der Höhe n ist. \\(\\stackrel{I.V.}{\\Rightarrow}\\) T hat \\(2&#94;{n-1} - 1\\) innere Knoten. Das sind auch innere Knoten von G. Da die Höhe von G um eins höher ist als die von T und sowohl G als auch T volle, vollstädige Binärbaume sind, kommen zu jedem der \\(2&#94;{n-1}\\) Blätter aus T noch 2 Blätter. Dadurch hat G genau \\(2&#94;{n-1}\\) innere Knoten mehr als T \\(\\Rightarrow\\) G hat \\(2&#94;{n-1}-1+2&#94;{n-1} = 2&#94;n - 1\\) innere Knoten \\(\\blacksquare\\) Aussagenlogische Ausdrücke Die Idee habe ich aus dem Matheboard von \"MoeMoeson\". Bei diesem Beweis bin ich mir aber nicht sicher, ob es tatsächlich strukturelle Induktion ist :-/ Definition: Aussagenlogischer Ausdruck Jede Variable \\(p_i, i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) ist ein aussagenlogischer Ausdruck über V. Sind A und B aussagenlogische Ausdrücke über V, so sind auch \\(\\neg A, A \\land B, A \\lor B, A \\Rightarrow B, A \\Leftrightarrow B, (A)\\) . Ein Wort über V ist nur dann ein aussagenlogischer Ausdruck über V, falls dies aufgrund endlich oftmaliger Anwendung von (i) und (ii) der Fall ist. Behauptung Jeder aussagenlogischer Ausdruck endet entweder auf eine Variable oder auf eine schließende Klammer. Beweis : durch strukturelle Induktion I.A. : Jeder aussagenlogischer Ausdruck aus (i) endet auf eine Variable. I.V. : Für beliebige, aber feste aussagenlogische Ausdrücke A gilt: A endet auf eine Variable oder eine schließende Klammer. I.S. : Ein aussagenlogischer Ausdruck kann nur durch endlich häufige Anwendung von (i) und (ii) erzeugt werden (vgl. (iii)). (i) erfüllt die Bedingung laut I.V., (ii) auch. \\(\\blacksquare\\) Behauptung Für jeden aussagenlogischen Ausdruck A gibt es einen äquivalenten aussagenlogischen Ausdruck B, der nur \\(\\neg\\) und \\(\\land\\) als Operatoren verwendet. Beweis : durch strukturelle Induktion I.A. : Seien \\(p_1, p_2\\) aussagenlogische Variablen. Dann gilt: \\(p_1 \\lor p_2 = \\neg (\\neg p_1 \\land \\neg p_2)\\) \\(p_1 \\Leftrightarrow p_2 = \\neg (p_1 \\land \\neg p_2) \\land \\neg (\\neg p_1 \\land p_2)\\) \\(p_1 \\Rightarrow p_2 = p_1 \\land \\neg p_2\\) Für alle weiteren Ausdrücke aus (i) und (ii) gilt die Behauptung offensichtlich. I.V. : Für beliebige, aber feste aussagenlogische Ausdrücke A gilt: Es gibt einen äquivalenten aussagenlogischen Ausdruck B, der nur \\(\\neg\\) und \\(\\land\\) als Operatoren verwendet. I.S. : Ein aussagenlogischer Ausdruck kann nur durch endlich häufige Anwendung von (i) und (ii) erzeugt werden (vgl. (iii)). (i) und (ii) erfüllen die Bedingung laut I.V.. \\(\\blacksquare\\) Unendlich - Wann Induktion nicht funktioniert Mit Induktion kann man Aussagen für beliebig große/kleine ganze Zahlen treffen. Allerdings eben nur für ganze Zahlen. Unendlich ist keine ganze Zahl. Also kann man auch keine Aussagen für \"unendliche Aussagen\" treffen. Hier ein Beispiel: Sei A eine Menge. A heißt offen \\(:\\Leftrightarrow \\forall_{x \\in A} : \\exists_{\\delta = \\delta(x) > 0} : U_\\delta(x) \\subseteq A\\) Es gilt: U und V sind offene Mengen \\(\\Rightarrow U \\cap V\\) ist offen.* Nun könnte man den Trugschluss machen, dass der Schnitt unendlich vieler offener Mengen auch offen ist. Der falsche Induktionsbeweis würde in etwa so aussehen: Voraussetungen: Seien \\(M_i, i \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) offene Mengen. Sei M eine Menge und definiert durch \\(M := \\displaystyle \\bigcap_{i=0}&#94;\\infty M_i\\) . Behauptung : M ist offen. Beweis : durch vollständige Induktion I.A. : Sei n = 1. Dann: \\(\\cap_{i=0}&#94;1 M_i = M_0 \\cap M_1\\) ist laut * offen. I.V. : Sei \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) beliebig, aber fest und es gelte: \\(\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{i=0}&#94;n M_i\\) ist offen. I.S. : \\(\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{i=0}&#94;{n+1} M_i = \\bigcap_{i=0}&#94;{n} M_i \\cap M_{n+1}\\) . Nun gilt: \\(\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{i=0}&#94;{n} M_i\\) ist per I.V. offen. \\(M_{n+1}\\) ist per Vorraussetzung offen. Der Schnitt von beiden ist wegen * offen. Da n beliebig groß werden kann, ist auch M offen \\(\\blacksquare\\) Allerdings gilt: \\(\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{n=1}&#94;\\infty \\left (1 - \\frac{1}{n}, 2+\\frac{1}{n} \\right) = [1, 2]\\) , also ein Gegenbeispiel. Der \"Beweis\" ist also offensichtlich falsch. Wo ist aber der Fehler? Man hat gezeigt, dass beliebig viele Schnitte von offenen Mengen wieder offen sind. Die Behauptung sagt aber, dass unendlich viele Schnitte offener Mengen wieder offen sind. Es gibt also einen unterschied zwischen \"beliebig viel\" und \"unendlich\".

Es ist beispielsweise gar nicht so leicht das exakte Gegenteil einer Aussage zu finden. Allgemeines zur Prädikatenlogik x sei im folgenden eine Aussage \\(\\neg x\\) : Die Negation der Aussage x \\(\\exists x\\) : Es existiert mindestens ein x (Quantor) \\(\\forall x\\) : Alle x (Quantor) \\(\\land\\) : und (eine Verknüfung zweier Aussagen) \\(\\lor\\) : oder (eine Verknüfung zweier Aussagen). Im Deutschen wird oder meistens exklusiv, also im Sinne \"entweder ... oder ...\" verwendet. Dieses oder ist inklusiv, also \"entweder ... oder ... oder beides\". Ich habe die Symbole bewusst in diesen Paragraphen angeordnet. Wird die Negation eines Ausdrucks gebildet, werden alle Symbole im Inneren durch das jeweils andere Symbol ersetzt. Beispielsweise wird das logische \"und\" zu einem \"oder\".

Was ist das Gegenteil dieser Aussage? Folgendes wäre denkbar: Kein Karlsruher fährt mit dem Rad oder der Straßenbahn. Kein Karlsruher fährt mit dem Rad und der Straßenbahn. Alle Karlsruher fahren mit dem Rad und der Straßenbahn. Alle Karlsruher fahren nicht mit dem Rad und der Straßenbahn. Es fahren nicht alle Karlsruher mit dem Rad oder der Straßenbahn. Es fahren nicht alle Karlsruher mit dem Rad und der Straßenbahn. ... Nun wurde mir beigebracht, dass folgendes eine \"saubere\" Formalisierung der ersten Aussage ist: Sei K die Menge aller Karlsruher. Sei F Aussageform auf K und definiert durch \\(F(k) := \\text{\"k f&auml;hrt mit dem Fahrrad\"} (k \\in K)\\) Sei analog S Aussageform auf K mit \\(S(k) := \\text{\"k f&auml;hrt mit der Stra&szlig;enbahn\"}\\) Dann lautet (i) formalisiert: \\(\\forall k \\in K: F(k) \\lor S(k)\\) (sprich: \"Für alle k in K gilt: F von k oder S von k\") Negiert: \\(\\exists k \\in K: \\neg F(k) \\land \\neg S(k)\\) (sprich: \"Es existiert mindestens ein k in K für das gilt: Es ist F von k nicht wahr und zugleich S von k nicht wahr.\") Übersetzt man das in einen schöneren deutschen Satz kann man sagen: Mindestens ein Karlsruher fährt weder mit dem Rad noch mit der Bahn. Wenn man das nun auf die oben angegebenen Lösungen bezieht, könnte es Aussage 5 oder 6 sein. Der Sinngemäß muss es heißen: Es fahren nicht alle Karlsruher entweder mit dem Rad, der Straßenbahn oder beidem. Ich tendiere stark dazu, Satz 5 zu nehmen. Allerdings bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob mein Sprachgefühl mich täuscht. Wöchentliches Fernsehprogramm Noch ein Beispiel aus meinem Tutorium: (ii) Im Fernsehen läuft jede Woche \"Die Simpsons\", \"Die Ludolfs\" und \"Telekolleg\". Sei W die Menge aller Wochen.

Begriffe Permutation Eine Permutation ist eine Veränderung der Reihenfolge einer geordneten Anzahl von Objekten. (Weil die Objekte in irgend einer Art geordnet sein müssen, damit sich eine Reihenfolge ändern kann, will ich diese Ansammlung nicht \"Menge\" nennen.) Beispiel: Wir haben eine Liste von Zahlen: [1, 2, 5, -7, -1, 3] Eine Permutation davon ist: [1, 2, 5, -7, 3, -1] Anagramme sind Permutationen: \"ANGSTBUDE\" und \"BUNDESTAG\" Das Wesentliche ist also, dass es bei Permutationen auf die Reihenfolge ankommt. k-Permutation Eine k-Permutation wählt aus n Objekten k aus. Wenn wir also die 6 Objekte [1, 2, 5, -7, -1, 3] haben, wären [1, 2, 5], [5, 2, 1], [-7, 2, 3] und [-7, 3, 3] verschiedene 3-Permutationen davon. Kombination und k-Kombination Bei einer Kombination kommt es nicht auf die Reihenfolge an. Sonst ist alles analog zu den Permutationen. Formeln Es gibt nur vier Formeln, die man sich merken sollte. Dabei sei n die Anzahl aller wählbaren Objekte: mit Wiederholungen ohne Wiederholungen k-Permutation $n&#94;k$ $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ k-Kombination $\\binom{n-1+k}{k}$ $\\binom{n}{k}$ Warum stimmt das? Wenn man n Objekte hat und k-mal eines davon auswählt, wobei die Reihenfolge eine Rolle spielt und man das Objekt danach immer wieder zurück legt (also Wiederholungen haben kann), dann hat man beim ersten mal n verschiedene Wahlmöglichkeiten. Beim zweiten, dritten, ... k.-Zug auch. Es sind also \\(\\underbrace{n \\cdot n \\cdot ... \\cdot n}_\\text{k mal} = n&#94;k\\) Möglichkeiten. Wenn man die Objekte nicht wieder zurück legt, die Reihenfolge aber eine Rolle spielt, hat man beim ersten Zug wieder n Möglichkeiten. Beim zweiten Zug sind es (n-1), beim dritten (n-3), ... beim k.-Zug (n-k+1) Möglichkeiten. Also gilt: \\(\\underbrace{(n-0) \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot ... \\cdot (n- (k-1))}_\\text{k Faktoren} = \\prod_{i=0}&#94;{k-1} (n-i)= \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) Angenommen es spielt nun nur eine Rolle, welche Objekte man ausgewählt hat, aber nicht wann. Dann gibt es, wenn man die Objekte nicht wieder zurücklegt, \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) Möglichkeiten, abzüglich der Möglichkeiten, die nur bei Beachtung der Reihenfolge eine Rolle spielen. Das bedeutet, es muss noch durch k! geteilt werden. Das kann man sich klar machen, indem man eine bestimmte Menge an k ausgewählten Objekten betrachtet. Dann muss man entscheiden, welches das erste ist. Dafür gibt es k Möglichkeiten. Für das zweite hat man (k-1) Möglichkeiten, usw. Das Bedeutet, es gibt für diesen Fall \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)! \\cdot k!} = \\binom{n}{k}\\) Möglichkeiten. Der schwerste Fall sind k-Kombinationen mit zurücklegen. Dafür denkt man sich am besten, dass man eine Liste der Objekte hat. Nun macht man, um die n Objekte zu trennen, zwischen diese (n-1) Sternchen. Die Anzahl wird durch k Striche repräsentiert. Nun kann man sich fragen, wie viele Möglichkeiten es gibt diese k Striche und (n-1) Sternchen anzuordnen. Das sind, wenn man die k Striche auf (n-1)+k Plätze verteilt: \\(\\frac{(n-1+k)!}{(n-1)!} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{k!}}_\\text{Reihenfolge ist egal} = \\frac{(n-1+k)!}{(n-1)!k!}\\) Dies entspricht genau dem Binomialkoeffizienten: \\(\\binom{n-1+k}{k} = \\frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!((n-1+k)-k)!} = \\frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!(n-1)!}\\) Siehe auch Wikipedia: Kombinatorik (Der Artikel ist leider sehr mager.

Es gibt verschiedene Beweisarten, aber im folgenden will ich nur einen direkten Beweis führen. Dieses Beispiel wurde in der Übung zu Analysis I von Herrn Bolleyer gemacht. Gliederung Beweise kann man in drei Teile gliedern: Voraussetzungen : Hier werden spezielle Objekte, die im Beweis benötigt werden, definiert. Behauptung : Die Behauptung stellt eine Aussage über die Objekte in der Voraussetzung auf. Sie kann sehr kurz sein. Beweis : Der Beweis zeigt durch eine folge von logischen Schlussfolgerungen aus den Voraussetzungen, dass die Behauptung wahr ist. Nötig ist manchmal nur die Behauptung und der Beweis. Mit der Vorraussetzung ist der Beweis zwar vollständig, allerdings würde ich vor dem eigentlichem Beweis eine Beweisidee begrüßen. Die Beweisidee kann sehr kurz sein. Das ist der eine Satz, der einem Studenten, der sich mit der Aussage beschäftigt hat, sagt wie sie zu lösen ist. Beispiel eines direkten Beweises Voraussetzung : Sei \\(M = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}: |x-3| \\lt 2 \\}\\) Behauptung : \\(M = (1,5)\\) Beweis : Per Definition gilt: \\(|x-3| : = \\left \\{ \\begin{array}{ll} x & \\text{, falls } x \\geq 3 \\\\ -(x-3) & \\text{, falls } x \\lt 3 \\end{array} \\right.\\) \\( M = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\lt 2 \\} = \\underbrace{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |x-3| \\lt 2 \\land x \\geq 3 \\}}_{M_1} \\cup \\underbrace{\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: |x -3| \\lt 2 \\land x \\lt 3\\}}_{M_2}\\) Betrachte \\(M_1\\) : \\( x\\in M_1 \\Leftrightarrow |x-3| \\lt 2 \\land x \\geq 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x-3 \\lt 2 \\land x \\geq 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow x \\lt 5 \\land x \\geq 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow 3 \\leq x \\lt 5\\) Also gilt \\(M_1 = [3, 5)\\) Betrachte \\(M_2\\) : \\( x\\in M_2 \\Leftrightarrow |x-3| \\lt 2 \\land x \\lt 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow -(x-3) \\lt 2 \\land x \\lt 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow -x + 3 \\lt 2 \\land x \\lt 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow 1 \\lt x \\land x \\lt 3\\) \\(\\Leftrightarrow 1 \\lt x \\lt 3\\) Also gilt \\(M_2 = (1,3)\\) Es gilt \\(M = M_1 \\cup M_2 = [3, 5) \\cup (1,3) = (1,5)\\) q.e.d. Weitere Beweisformen Der Induktionsbeweis ist sehr nützlich, wenn man eine Aussage für Elemente zeigen muss, die einen festen Abstand haben. Also z.B. eine Aussage für die Natürlichen Zahlen oder die ganzen Zahlen. Der Widerspruchsbeweis ist gut geeignet, wenn notwendige, aber nicht hinreichende Kriterien für das Gegenteil der Behauptung nicht erfüllt sind.

I just want to show you some examples of the unexpected behavior (for non-python-programmers) of lists in Python. Imagine you have the following Python source code: #!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import copy example1 = [[ 1 , 5 , 7 ],[ 3 , 6 ],[], [ 8 , 1 , 6 ]] example2 = example1 [:] example3 = list ( example1 ) example4 = copy . deepcopy ( example1 ) example1 [ 1 ][ 0 ] = 0 example1 . append ( 1 ) print example1 print example2 print example3 print example4 How should the output look like? Think about it a second, then scroll down. [[ 1 ,5,7 ] , [ 0 ,6 ] , [] , [ 8 ,1,6 ] ,1 ] [[ 1 ,5,7 ] , [ 0 ,6 ] , [] , [ 8 ,1,6 ]] [[ 1 ,5,7 ] , [ 0 ,6 ] , [] , [ 8 ,1,6 ]] [[ 1 ,5,7 ] , [ 3 ,6 ] , [] , [ 8 ,1,6 ]] The reason for this strange behavior is how lists are handled in Python. The variable itself is basically only the pointer to the list. If you slice the list (myList[:]) you copy each value of the list into another list. If myList was a nested list, it contained the pointers to the sublists. So, if you want to make a deep copy, you have to use the copy module. Scoping phimuemue added this example in my old blog: Another issue I ran into concerns the scoping of Python: i = 0 [ i for i in [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]] print ( i ) # yields 3 That means, python doesn't create a new variable for the list comprehension but uses the outer i. Recursive Lists a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] b = [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] a . append ( b ) print ( a ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]] b . append ( a ) print ( b ) [ 4 , 5 , 6 , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , [ ... ]]] print ( a ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , [ 4 , 5 , 6 , [ ... ]]] Do you know more examples of unexpected behavior of python lists?

Although I think that the Websites of KIT is much better than the Website of most Universities, I can imagine several possibilities how the online services could be improved: Use OpenID I have 9 different accounts with 7 different passwords for university. After my first week. I guess it is impossible to use the same login system for all services of the university as we have many different teams of developers. But it is easily possible to get an OpenID provider. The students could have an URL like student.kit.edu/openid/u.... or something similar. The login would always happen at one place and this server could tell the other services that the right user is trying to get access. Some more information about OpenID is here: Wikipedia (the German article is much better) OpenID According to Dave (4:35 min) The Implications of OpenID (51:19 min) Customization It would help me a lot if I could customize my start page at studium.kit.edu by adding some links / text. Consistency The university was called \"University of Karlsruhe\" (\"Universität Karlsruhe\" in German) a few years ago. Then they thought it was time to rename the university as they made major structural changes. URLs - one Top-level domain They also got a new URL. Before the new one is kit.edu, but it seems as if many pages were still on the old TLD : uni-karlsruhe.de: fsmi.uni-karlsruhe.de : fsmi.kit.edu mach.uni-karlsruhe.de : should be mach.kit.edu http://www.ira.uka.de/: webinscribe.ira.uka.de : should be webinscribe.kit.edu. Additionally, a link from studium.kit.edu to this service should be created. www.itas.fzk.de : should be itas.kit.edu. (I guess fzk means \"Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe\" - research center Karlsruhe) This could be fixed with the following steps: Find old URLs / Links (e.g. with RegEx and a crawler ) Introduce the new URL by one of those two possibilities: Make HTML-redirections for the new ones (e.g. from fsmi.kit.edu to www.fsmi.uni-karlsruhe.de) Move the content from the old space to the new space. Make sure that nothing breaks by adding a 301 status code . Replace all links to the old URL by the new URL. Wait at least one, rather two semester. Check which internal Websites still use the old URL and try to fix those links. Completely remove the old URL Services in one place KIT offers quite a lot of online services, such as Search for books in KIT-library bvprint : How much money is left on my printing-account? Webmail: u....@student.kit.edu / prename.lastname@student.kit.edu / u....@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de: owa.kit.edu - with Microsofts OWA s_...@atis.uka.de: webmail.ira.uni-karlsruhe.de - with Horde Groupware Web-Server with MySQL databases and phpMyAdmin New Sites : Create a site for you For some services you need to login via https://vpn.kit.edu : Print preview: https://scc-print.scc.kit.edu and the (buggy) newer version . PrintUtil : Which jobs are in the queue of the printer? Scanning: studscan.ira.uka.de I had to search for some services, like a SVN-Repository ( How do I get a SVN repository at KIT? ) The important services should be available at studium.kit.edu. I think this would be a link to the Webmail, to the printing services and webinscribe. Help the user to find what he needs Redundancy Sometimes it is good to provide several alternatives. I have one example: One of the most important URLs at my university's website is studium.kit.edu. In the first week, I typed quite often student.kit.edu. Google corrected kit to mit and the MIT has such a page. I think it would be a good idea to look at the 404-error log and check, if this occurs often. If it does, a redirect should probable be added. All redundant URLs should point to ONE target, of course. It's best to use a 301 redirection. Short, but meaningful URLs At the moment KIT makes use of such URLs: www.kit.edu/index.php should be kit.edu www.informatik.kit.edu/index.php should be informatik.kit.edu www.informatik.kit.edu/883.php should be informatik.kit.edu/informatik-bachelor www.informatik.kit.edu/interact.php should be informatik.kit.edu/interact This can be done by modifying the .htaccess-file (for the decision to redirect calls prefixed with www to a non-www page). In many cases you can use the URL which I would prefer, but you're redirected to the other one. This means if a professor is copying the ugly link to his presentation, all students will have to write it down. Helpfull 404 Page At the moment I get only: \"404 NOT FOUND\". This is not very helpful. You should provide a custom 404 error page . Use Feeds I would like to get the latest news about KIT, but I don't want to search for it. I also don't want to look at the homepage of KIT to check if I know the latest content. This should be done with a RSS feed. The start page should have an auto-detectable RSS-Feed. It can be added with the following HTML-Tag in the head-section of the document: < link rel = \"alternate\" type = \"application/rss+xml\" title = \"KIT News Feed\" href = \"/rss/\" /> Use HTML5 input tags HTML5 input tags can much more than the old ones. You can define autofocus for the first element, placeholders , autocomplete =off for password fields at the registration, patterns for clients side validation and much more types than text and password. Old browsers automatically fall back into a simple text input field. Examples for pages that could be improved: kit.edu : Add search engine autodiscovery Register library account studium.kit.edu kit.edu (the search box) kit.edu/studieren/6243.php (the contact form at the bottom) kit.edu/markt/userlogin (the login form) If somebody had much free time he could try to get valid HTML5 for the whole website. This isn't really helpful for the user (by now), but it would be nice to have a standard conform website. Payments You have to pay with the \"KIT-Card\" for meals in the cafeteria and if you want to print something. But you have to transfer the money to the printing account from your cafeteria account, before you can print anything. This seems to be not logical for me.

This project aims to create a standard for publishing the metadata which describes a search engine: name, description, URL-pattern, language, ... A OSSD looks like this: <OpenSearchDescription xmlns= \"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\" > <ShortName> Example </ShortName> <Description> My example search engine </Description> <InputEncoding> UTF-8 </InputEncoding> <Image height= \"16\" width= \"16\" type= \"image/x-icon\" > http://example.org/favicon.ico </Image> <Url type= \"text/html\" template= \"http://example.org/index.html#search={searchTerms}\" /> </OpenSearchDescription> The browser needs a hint where it can find the OSSD. So you have to add the following tag to your website: <link title = \"Example\" type = \"application/opensearchdescription+xml\" rel = \"search\" href = \"http://example.org/opensearch.xml\" > Now you can add the websites internal search engine automatically to Chrome and easily to Firefox and Internet Explorer 8+.

Instead, you can add it via Settings: Add Search Engines via Settings in Google Chrome Chrome also adds the sites internal search engine automatically. Did you ever notice this? Here are some screenshots: Google Chrome Search - Hit tab to search this site Google Chrome Search - Search with the websites internal search engine Interestingly the auto discovery only works if the search engine is at the homepage. You have to have either an input field of the type search or of the type text with the name s : < form > < input type = \"search\" name = \"s\" /> </ form > or < form > < input type = \"text\" name = \"s\" /> </ form > Drawbacks It seems as if Safari didn't support OSSD natively. (14.04.2011) Internet Explorer 9 seems not to support OSSD. No support by Opera. This article in a nutshell opensearch.xml gives meta information about your websites internal search engine For Chromes autodiscovery you will need to add an input fild with \"type=search\" or \"name=s\" It is not necessary for Chrome that the user can see the form (display:none with CSS) nor that it the site start page is loaded long (meta redirect after 0 seconds). Adding the search engine manually is possible in almost all browsers With OSSD you can manage more than one internal search engine.

Basisdefinitionen bei Zufallsexperimenten Was ist ein ideales Zufallsexperiment? Ein ideales Zufallsexperiment sollte gut beschrieben, wiederholbar und mit mehreren möglichen Ausgängen (also zufällig), sein. Die Zufallsgröße, wie beispielsweise die erwürfelte Zahl, nennt man Zufallsvariable . Es gibt auch noch die Statistische Variable . Wo der Unterschied ist, kann ich nicht sagen. Allerdings habe ich auf Wikipedia eine Diskussion geöffnet und hoffe auf baldige Klärung. Was sind Merkmale? Merkmale sind die Ausgänge eines Zufallsexperiments. Sie können folgendermaßen gegliedert werden: quantitativ (Die Zufallsgröße(n) haben natürlicherweise eine Ordnung) stetig (Es können in einem Intervall beliebige Werte angenommen werden, z.B. die Größe eines Menschen.) diskret (Es können nur bestimmte Größen angenommen werden, z.B. die Größe eines Menschen in ganzen Zentimetern.) qualitativ (Es gibt keine natürliche Ordnung.) ordinal (Es geht um Zahlengrößen, z.B.

Now I know that the password changing service of PayPal can be improved quite a lot. I had to type the password about twelve times! This is the reason why I thought it was time to create some principles for good password changing services: User authentication : It is important that only the user can change the password. You have to force the user to type in his old password again. This should be done as a first step in the authentication. Nothing is more frustrating than being forced to type in your old password again and again as your new password wasn't valid. You could check if he typed in his old password less than a minute ago. Eliminate typos : Like every good service, PayPal wants you to type the password and the verification. It would be good, if two symbols were added to the textbox. One for the activation of caps lock and one for num lock . I think this has to be done by the browser. Client-side validation : The first time, I used a password which was considered as weak. A JavaScript informed me that it was weak, but I could submit the form. The form should be validated on the client. If it is not valid, don't let him submit the form. (The password has to be validated also on the server, of course.) Allow all characters : I was very negatively surprised as I was informed that PayPal doesn't allow \"non-printable characters\" like spaces. They informed me after I submitted, of course. It does make sense to warn the user if he uses special characters which might be difficult to type on other systems, like German umlauts (äöüÄÖÜß). But why the hell do they force me to use underscores instead of spaces? Do they print my password? Do they want that I print my password? Allow \"weak\" passwords : You should not allow weak passwords, of course. But you should have a good definition of weak. Less than 6 characters is weak. I wanted to use a 26-character password with upper- and lower case letters, spaces and one special character. This was considered as weak. If you read my post about MD5 cracking you have probably noticed, that it is much harder to crack a 26-character password with only lower case letters than a 8 character password with lower case, upper case and numbers. About \\(10&#94;{22}\\) times as much passwords are possible with 26 characters and 26 letters than with a character-space of 62 elements but only 8 places (see Wolfram|Alpha ). You can easily build a password if you use a sentence, not a word. This will be long and will quite possibly only have lower case letters, spaces and one upper case letter, but it is possible to remember it. Password Strength Allow long passwords : As the passwords should not be stored as plaintext, but hashed it doesn't really matter how long they are. If you use MD5, it will always take 32 characters. Why should you limit a user to only 20 characters (like PayPal does)? If the 26 character password is easier to remember, why do you want to restrict him to a shorter password which is easier to crack? I made the same annoying experiences with the password of my students account for university. They forced me to use a short password with a lower case and upper case letters, digits and special characters. Do you have some more suggestions for good passwords? Which websites have a very good password changing service?","tags":"The Web","title":"Password Changing Services"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/md5-cracking/","text":"MD5 is a cryptographic hash function. This means, you can give the MD5 algorithm a string and it will return another 32-character long alphanumeric string. The returned string looks quite random, but it isn't. If you use the same input, you always get the same 32 character output. What is it good for? Well, imagine you had a web application. Now an attacker found a security whole and can read the password-column in the database. If it was plain text, he could use the passwords to log into the users accounts. As it is hashed and the hash function can't be simply reverted. So the attacker can't take any advantage of the passwords he just read. It is much more realistic that the attacker can read the whole database. So he can access sensitive user data. As it is very likely that you have some e-mail adresses in there, he could quite probably log into the e-mail accounts of the users with the same password. If the password is hashed, it's not that simple. He has to try to crack the MD5 hashed passwords. I'll describe and test in the following how easy this is and how it could be done. Tested Hashes MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function. I wanted to know how easy it is to crack them, so I tested it. I used those passwords: \"computer\": df53ca268240ca76670c8566ee54568a \"establishment\": f469410e5ec7594a9c41603e06ccf6a3 \"My Birthday\": ce9dbd008dac54422b90b3f82f58dd40 \"I'm born in 1990.\": 834649b6298642a7576b10c6705842d8 \"r4Nd0m9\": cc11c3de28e4425eff27b2fb5f216903 Online Crackers If you search for \"md5 cracker\" you find some md5 crackers . This website could crack computer , establishment and My Birthday . The other two hashes weren't cracked. John the Ripper Ubuntu-Users can easily install John the Ripper (sudo apt-get install john) and use it for cracking hashes. To do so, the have to create a file in their working directory (let's call it md5.txt) and execute the following command: john --format = raw-MD5 md5.txt Here is the time, john needed to crack the hashes: \"computer\": 0.521 seconds \"establishment\": after 1 h it wasn't cracked \"My Birthday\": after 5 min it wasn't cracked \"I'm born in 1990.\": after 5 min it wasn't cracked \"r4Nd0m9\": after 38 min it wasn't cracked Okay, these results aren't good. But you can also use a wordlist (e.g. the 15 MB list from http://www.bright-shadows.net/download/downloads.php) and the command john --wordlist:tbswordlist1.txt --format=raw-MD5 md5.txt \"computer\": df53ca268240ca76670c8566ee54568a \"establishment\": 0.568 seconds \"My Birthday\": not cracked \"I'm born in 1990.\": not cracked \"r4Nd0m9\": not cracked","tags":"The Web","title":"MD5 cracking"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/challenge-websites/","text":"Challenge websites are websites which offer many tasks to solve and a ranking system. If you solve the challenges, you get points and your rank increases. You don't get anything else. No money, no price. Only the knowledge and the ranking. Which is enough in my opinion. It might sound strange to others, but its fun to try to find the error in an application or to try to get better than others. The topics could be anything, but most of the time you should exploit a security whole. All Challenge websites I know use categories to organize their challenges. I'll describe some of them later. Why should challenge websites be more famous? Some people think its exciting to get to know the internals of a system. Questions like \"What will happen if I take the absolute value of -2,147,483,648?\" come automatically to their mind. If you are not one of those guys, you might ask yourself \"Why -2147483648? Why not -1234?\". Well, the simple answer is that in almost every programming language integers have 32 bytes. This means, you can store 2&#94;32 values in this variable. As you have negative numbers, only 2&#94;31 for each side. As you have 0, for one side one less. The range of an integer is in most languages -2&#94;31 to +(2&#94;31 -1). So if you take the absolute value of -2&#94;31, you're out of that range. It is much more interesting to get to know what could possibly go wrong in other systems and to show others your punditry than setting up an isolated system and trying to get unexpected results. If you don't know about challenge websites it is quite likely that you will try your knowledge on productive systems. This might result in a real damage. Another reason why challenge websites should get more famous is the moral compass. Even very young children can get an awfully amount of knowledge in computers. They might be able to hack others, but they don't have a feeling for whats wrong and right. If they try their knowledge in on a challenge website, they get a community they can talk to. I guess the administrators will not be happy if they exploit their systems, but if they tell them how to fix it I guess they would not go to the police. (As it is very likely that the attacker didn't really cause any damage like the loss of personal information or shutting down a system for which customers paid for, I think it is very unlikely that they will got to police.). I think it's very likely that they will give the credits for the patch / bug on their site. hacker.org does so, for example. I could also imagine that software companies could be interested in such websites. Wouldn't it be a great idea to post programming challenges and to contact the people who rank high? What are common categories? JavaScript JavaScript password protections are not secure. They are very easy to exploit and the website owner can be sure, that he will not open a real security leak when he creates such a challenge. Some common tasks include: Looking into the source code of the webpage Deactivating JavaScript because you are redirected Understanding JavaScript Exploit Many websites have server side bugs or vulnerabilities. So you can create challenges for \"hackers\" to find and exploit those to get to a hidden page. These exploits could be: SQL injections XSS Missing password protection Code injection Possible rights escalation Cryptography Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. This means you know that others will read your messages, but this doesn't mean they have to get to know what it means. They will only see rubbish and hopefully they don't know how to translate it into a meaningful sentence. As cryptography is older than computers you can find very many cryptographical challenges. One of the most common ones is the Caesar cipher . Most ciphers are in at least one of the following categories: Classical Ciphers Substitution Ciphers Transposition Ciphers Block Ciphers Symmetrical Ciphers Asymmetrical Ciphers Steganography Steganography is the art of hiding data. In the case of cryptography, your opponent knows that he has the information. In case of steganography he might think that he has only a nice picture. Did you ever use invisible ink as a child? Congratulations, you have already applied steganography! Some common steganographic challenges are: Looking at the source code of a webpage Looking very exactly at a high resolution image Examining a .gif with multiple layers / a video Playing a sound really slow / fast Playing with the bits of an image CrackIts CrackIts are challenges where you have to change a binary to get the results. Cracks are quite common. Perhaps you know that some illegal versions a very expensive software which can be found online don't need the registration code. They were cracked. Flash / Java Applets It is basically always decompiling and understanding the crappy output. As a reallife-application you could imagine an online game where you want to get into the highscore. Decompile it, look at the place where it gets submitted and submit your wished high score. Programming Programming challenges have a time component. You need to solve a specific instance of a problem in, well, lets say three seconds. Enough time for a computer to connect to the webpage, download the problem, solve it and upload the solution. Most of the time by far not enough to solve it by hand. Logic, Math and Science A classical logic challenge is the riddle of the Sphinx . Another one is Einstein's riddle . I guess you can imagine what a math challenge is? 1 + 1 = x, solve to x would be one. The Impossible Puzzle would be another one. The science challenges are like the homework I had to do in school. Some are very difficult, others are quite easy. But the kind of questions which were very similar to the questions in school. Information Gathering Almost every challenge could also be in the \"Information Gathering\" category. Who doesn't try Google first? (Except if the answer is obvious, of course.) Basic tasks are to get to know something about the owner of a specific website or about the content of a website a few years ago.

Living near the University is quite important for me as I hate traveling long. In the central part of Karlsruhe , the city I study in, most houses are very old. The house I live in was built around 1900 and modernized from time to time. A heater and electricity were added, for example. The flat is shared by students. My hirer told me that he will pay all cost of materials if I wanted to improve something. As a new leaser came and we had no washing machine we thought it was time to renovate the kitchen. The old kitchen Why did I renovate? We needed more space for a new washing machine. The old countertop was ugly, molded and had a water damage. The tap was loose. The tube for hot water was loose. Some photos Old countertop of our kitchen The old countertop Top of the old countertop Plans Kitchen before renovation Kitchen after renovation The renovation Tools I needed quite a lot of tools. I had to buy most of them when I saw that I couldn't continue without them: Drilling machine Plumber wrench Screwdrivers Silicone cartridge Spirit level Wrench Additionally I needed a hammer to get the wall plugs into the wall, some different screws and wall plugs, pliers, some tubes and some O-rings . Photos while working Crooked wall Heating pipes To save some money and to be sure that it really fits, I waited with the renovation until the washing machine was delivered. After it was here I had to move it quite often to get the ledge at it's place. As I removed the old countertop, I saw that a tube was loose. This had to be fixed. So I mounted it to the wall. Adding a working ledge is very important. I simply took some wood which was about the right size (4cm x 1cm) / length (about 1.5m). It gives your countertop the needed stability and you can make sure that it's exactly horizontally. Therefore you should use a spirit level. I drilled a small, long hole in the wall and used long wall plugs / screws. They are about 4cm in the wall. As you don't see those later, it doesn't have to look nice, but it has to be stable. You have to connect both countertops very good. If you don't do so, you will get water in there which will destroy the countertop over time. So we filled the space in between with wood glue and pressed them together with this screw construction. This little metal plate fixates the tap to the countertop. I put it for two days into vinegar to get rid of most of the rust, dirt and chalk. Before I did so, the whole plate was brown. Angle joints fix the countertop to the wall. I used 23 angle joints with 46 screws. Nothing will separate my countertop from the wall :D Removing silicone leftovers is a pretty time intensive work. You can remove a lot with a knife, but if the underground is tender you have to use some chemicals. The chemicals I used are called \"Max Bahr - Silikon Entferner\". It seems to be called \"Caulk Remover\" in English. I had to apply mine with a brush which was in the package. After 10 minutes, I could remove some more of the caulk. If you want to make a clean silicone clogging, you should mask the surrounding area. Adding a baseboard was one of the last steps. This small piece of would should prevent water from touching the wallpaper. Moreover it looks nice ☺ The new kitchen Kitchen after renovation Exact work: It fitted only with a few millimeters left. Good that I added some space to make sure it will fit. If I made the plate exactly as big as it could have been according to my first plan, I would have been in trouble. Conclusion I am proud of the result. The new kitchen looks nice, the countertop is very exact horizontally, no water drips out. Some parts could have been done better (like the silicone clogging), but I guess most could not be much better. The next time I do something like this I will hopefully not have to go about ten times to the hardware store :-/ Now I have some more tools :D","tags":"My bits and bytes","title":"Kitchen renovation - Part 1"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/5-web-technologies-which-should-be-used-more-often/","text":"RSS-Feeds RSS-Feeds Everyone who wants to get informed about updates on websites has to use RSS Feeds. Every time any website you have in your Feed Reader makes an update, you can get instantly a little notice. Its a bit like e-mail, but you have the possibility to stop this service. You can't get spam, as the Feed owner doesn't get an identifier for you. OpenID OpenID It is really annoying to register on every single page you use. The idea behind OpenID is having one account for registering on many domains. If you want to log-in in Blogger, you are sent to Google. You type in your username and password and Google sends you back to Blogger. Here is another explanation: The process seems to be too complex for many users, so Google developed the Google Identity Toolkit (GIT). The technique is really nice, but I don't like the idea that I have to force my users to use Google (or a service of them). Though I use Google for almost everything. Ajax Ajax is a programming style. If you like to view another page or get some information which isn't already loaded, you don't have to reload the whole page. The Pages simply display the new content as soon as it has loaded the content. GMail makes heavy use of Ajax. Hierarchical Labels Well, I guess this is less a technology than an idea. I think it would be great if labels were used more often. I'd like to sort my personal files with labels, not with folders. The advantage of labels in comparison with folders is that you can add any number of labels to one object (file, e-mail, ...). But you can have a file only in one path if you don't copy the file. So you have to know how the person is thinking, if you want to find the file you are searching for. Example: You search for a file about you favorite books. Unfortunately, you don't remember if it was an Excel-file or a Word-file. Now you have this tree structure: Excel Documents School E-mails eBooks Math School Biology Chemistry English Math Word The document you a re searching for could be in Word; in School/English, in Documents/eBooks or in Excel. You you had labels for your files, you could just select the files with a \"Books\"-label. I wrote \"Hierarchical Labels\", because sometimes you have one label, that comes always with another one, but not the other way round. As I am not very interested in chemistry, all files about chemistry were for school. So if I tagged a file with \"chemistry\" it should automatically get the \"school\"-tag. Gravatar-Logo Gravatar Have you ever noticed blogs or other sites where some people have avatars and others don't? Sometimes, if a possibility to login is provided this is not really amazing. But where does the website get the pictures from if there is no possibility to log in? Gravatar (an abbreviation for globally recognized avatar) is a service for providing globally-unique avatars. This is good for any website, where you don't have the possibility to store large amounts of data or you don't want to be annoyed with different file types, resizing and users who can't manage to use your software. Here is a web service, that allows you to quickly see the Gravatars of one e-mail address.

You need to know what is later or if both dates are the same. PHP time formats and functions PHP knows these time / date formats: UNIX Timestamp: Integer - The number of seconds after 1970. Related functions are int mktime([ int \\$hour = date(\"H\") [, int \\$minute = date(\"i\") [, int \\$second = date(\"s\") [, int \\$month = date(\"n\") [, int \\$day = date(\"j\") [, int \\$year = date(\"Y\") [, int \\$is_dst = -1 ]]]]]]]) int time() string date( string \\$format [, int $timestamp = time() ] ) int strtotime( string \\$time [, int \\$now ] ) I recommend using YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss if possible. Associative Arrays. The array looks like this Array ( [year] => 2006 [month] => 12 [day] => 12 [hour] => 10 [minute] => 0 [second] => 0 [fraction] => 0.5 [warning_count] => 0 [warnings] => Array() [error_count] => 0 [errors] => Array() [is_localtime] => ) The related functions are: array date_parse (string $date) array getdate ([ int $timestamp = time() ] ) DateTime Class : This class can do quite a lot. You should read the manual if you're interested in using it. Comparisons Comparing UNIX Timestamps is like comparing integers. No problem. Comparing Arrays is more interesting. What do you think will the following script print? <?php $d1 = date_parse ( \"2011-05-11\" ); $d2 = date_parse ( \"2011-05-11 13:00:00\" ); print_r ( $d1 ); print_r ( $d2 ); if ( $d1 < $d2 ) { echo '$d1 is less than $d2.' ; } else if ( $d1 == $d2 ) { echo '$d1 is equal to $d2.' ; } else { echo '$d1 is greater than $d2.' ; } ?> It prints '$d1 is less than $d2.' as date_parse (\"2011-05-11\"); is basically the same as date_parse (\"2011-05-11 00:00:00\"); You can compare the Array to an integer, but I don't know what PHP does. It seems as if the array would always be considered as being greater. If you use the functions you'll be fine. MySQL time formats and functions MySQL knows these date and time types and those functions . Here is a very short overview: DATETIME : 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59' DATE : 'YYYY-MM-DD' range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31' TIMESTAMP : like DATETIME, but range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC Those examples show more than a long explanation: mysql> SELECT CURTIME () ; -> '23:50:26' # Adding zero will NOT convert it to a UNIX timestamp: mysql> SELECT CURTIME () + 0 ; -> 235026 .000000 # An \"integered\" TIME mysql> SELECT NOW ( ) -> '2011-10-04 18:33:45' # Adding zero is a bad idea here, too: mysql> SELECT NOW ( ) +0 -> 20111004190945 .000000 # An \"integered\" DATETIME # If you want a UNIX Timestamp, use this function mysql> SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP () ; -> 1317746025 mysql> SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP ( '2011-10-04 18:33:45' ) ; -> 1317746025 # You can also convert it: mysql> SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP ( ` my_datetime_row ` ) FROM ` my_table ` Comparisons You can compare two DATETIMEs like this: SELECT ` my_row ` FROM ` my_table ` WHEN ` datetime1 ` < ` datetime2 ` It's of course not problem if you compare two UNIX Timestamps which are stored as integers in the database: SELECT ` my_row ` FROM ` my_table ` WHEN ` int1 ` < ` int2 ` But what happens if you compare a DATETIME with a Timestamp (integer)? SELECT ` my_row ` FROM ` my_table ` WHEN ` datetime1 ` < UNIX_TIMESTAMP () This is basically: SELECT ` my_row ` FROM ` my_table ` WHEN ` datetime1 ` < 1317750167 And it compares the \"integered\" DATETIME 20111004210710 for 2011-10-04 21:07:10 with 1317750167. This is obviously crap. Don't do it. Never. Instead you should convert your dates with UNIX_TIMESTAMP(your_datetime) or FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp). Comparing MySQL types with PHP types The simplest way to compare MySQL DATE formats with PHP types is using strtotime(...) or date(...) if needed. If you have a DATETIME and you want to know if it's in the past, you can use if (strtotime($datetime) < time()) { echo '$datetime is in the past.'; } From PHP to MySQL If you have a date you got via an date input field and want to submit it to MySQL, just use this piece of code: $mysqlFormat = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($_POST['my_date']));","tags":"Code","title":"Comparing Dates in PHP and MySQL"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/motion-of-the-sun/","text":"How is the sun moving, according to our latitude, the time of the day and the time of the year?

Unfortunately, its almost always white colored text on a black background, without any accentuation. No bold text, nothing underlined and no colors are used. You can change this standard behaviour. You can add color to your output. This is the way you do it: The mini-program tput can initialize a terminal or query terminfo database. If you want to know more about it, you can take a look at the tput manpage . A quick example # Text color variables txtred = $( tput setaf 1 ) # Red txtreset = $( tput sgr0 ) # Reset your text echo \"Roses are ${ txtred } red ${ txtreset } .\" Simply copy this example line by line and then you'll see the expected example. A shorter way would be echo \"Roses are `tput setaf 1`red`tput sgr0`.\" The sgr attribuge tput sgr 0 1 turn off standout ; turn on underline tput sgr 0 0 turn off standout ; turn off underline tput sgr 1 1 turn on standout ; turn on underline tput sgr 1 0 turn on standout ; turn off underline tput sgr0 short for sgr 0 0 The setaf attribute setaf 1 Red setaf 2 Green setaf 3 Yellow setaf 4 Blue setaf 5 Purple setaf 6 Cyan setaf 7 Gray Misc Make your text bold: tput bold Reset your style: tput sgr0 Advanced Example Imagine you had a script which generated much output. All messages are important for you, but some are more important than others. You definitely want to see all \"[ERROR]\" output. So you want to apply a red and bold modification to the stream. This is the way how \"[ERROR]\" gets red and bold: ` tput setaf 1 `` tput bold ` [ ERROR ] ` tput sgr0 ` You can test it with echo \"`tput setaf 1``tput bold`[ERROR]`tput sgr0`\" I've created a little python script called output.py for testing purposes. It simply outputs a quite long Lorem ipsum text with some random [ERROR] messages. The next task is to replace the [ERROR] messages. The tool of my choice is sed. See the sed man page for more information. The basic usage is sed 's/search/replace/' So we pipe the output to sed: python output.py | sed 's/$$ERROR$$/MYLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONGTEST/' And now we bring it all together: python output.py | sed 's/[ERROR]/`tput setaf 1``tput bold`[ERROR]`tput sgr0`/' Doesn't work? Well, lets analyse it. Instead of replacing tput setaf 1 it gets printed directly. This means, something we did prevented the bash of replacing our command. If you look carefully at the command, you might see that I used ' instead of \". If you change this, everything is fine: python output.py | sed \"s/ $$ ERROR $$ /`tput setaf 1``tput bold`[ERROR]`tput sgr0`/\" Colorize C / C++ output You need ANSI color codes : #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf ( \" \\\\ 033[30m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"black?\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[31m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"red\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[32m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"lime\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[33m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"yellow\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[34m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"blue\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[35m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"gray\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[36m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"blue\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[37m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"light gray\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[38m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"black?\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[39m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"black?\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[41m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"red background\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[1;34m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"bold and blue\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[4m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"underlined\" ); printf ( \" \\\\ 033[9m%s \\\\ 033[0m \\n \" , \"strike\" ); return 0 ; } \\033 is the ASCII 27 ESC character. It has to be followed by \"[\". After that you can write one or two numbers separated by \";\". Then you have to write \"m\". You can get back to standard output with \"\\033[0m\". The numbers 30–37 change the color, 4 is a single underline. I guess these will also work for Java, but I didn't test it. Do you know what setaf or sgr stand for?

A very common approach to solve this problem are CAPTCHAs - C ompletely A utomated P ublic T uring test to tell C omputers and H umans A part. The idea behind CAPTCHAs is to give the spammer a problem which is hard to solve for a computer program but easy to solve for a human. Most CAPTCHAs are really boring. I tried to find different categories of them, but most you will find online are in the \"Optical character recognition\" category: Optical character recognition Web Wiz CAPTCHA I hope nobody seriously pays the 6 Euro for Web Wiz . As many very simple CAPTCHAs it lacks a support for blind people. It is quite easy to read for humans, but I guess also for bots. They always use only five random characters which are written in blue. They added some dots and straight lines to make segmentation more difficult. I guess they never tried to hack their own CAPTCHA. If they did, they should be aware that those small dots don't change anything and the straight lines can easily be detected and removed. It also seems to me as if they only used one font. Google did some great work with reCAPTCHA . I think I'll write a longer post about this later, but to keep it short: They use the reader (or spammer) to digitalize the books they scan. So if someone uses very good algorithms to bypass their CAPTCHA, the spammer will help Google. This is a very nice way to end up in a win-win situation, isn't it? reCAPTCHA has also support for blind people. The characters you have to type in are actual words. This makes it a lot easier for humans to recognize the characters. reCAPTCHA is very easy to use. No need of GD or ImageMagick . If you can't read it, just reload it. Here is a screenshot of reCAPTCHA: reCAPTCHA Here is another \"traditional\" CAPTCHA example.

They ask you questions like: Which of milk, hotel or brain is a body part? How many letters in \"devotional\"? The word \"tamers\" has which letter in 2nd position? Enter the smallest number of 28, thirteen, twenty, 60, fifty six or 78: Which of knee, leg, ear or ankle is above the waist? I don't think this type is very good as the spammer has to do almost the same amount of work as the programmer. He has to parse the different types of questions, but I guess this isn't too hard. He might just ask Google: what is 7 minus 3 times 2? or what is the number of horns on a unicorn times the answer to life, the universe, and everything? . egglue - Egglue Semantic CAPTCHA Mathematics I've seen some CAPTCHAs asking for very basic math questions like the following one.

This is the reason why I didn't use OOP in any of my (small) projects and why I don't understand those people who want every piece of code in OOP-style: Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. \"What do you think this is?\" One advisor, an engineer , answered first. \"It is a toaster,\" he said. The king asked, \"How would you design an embedded computer for it?\" The engineer replied, \"Using a four-bit microcontroller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working prototype.\" The second advisor, a computer scientist , immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, \"Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years.\" \"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes.\" \"The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs.\" \"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too.\" \"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook.\" \"Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase. An Intel 80386 with 8MB of memory, a 30MB hard disk, and a VGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a four-bit microcontroller!).\" The king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all lived happily ever after.","tags":"Code","title":"Joke: Electrical Engineering vs. Computer Science"},{"url":"https://martin-thoma.com/google-ngram-viewer/","text":"On October 14, 2010 Google announced that the number of scanned books is over 15 million. They did not simply scan those books, but they digitalized them. They can access not only image files, but the actual text. This allows Google to search in those books and to analyze the information. Google has processed 1,024,908,267,229 words of running text and is publishing the counts for all 1,176,470,663 five-word sequences that appear at least 40 times. One five-word-sequence would be a five-gram, a four-word-sequence a four-gram. Google has published the Ngram Viewer. This is a tool which allows the user to specify some Ngrams and search how often they appear over the years. Here is an example search: Google Ngram Viewer: Germany vs France The x-axis shows the years, the y-axis shows the percentage of the specified ngram of all ngrams. Don't bother with the numbers. If one curve is higher than the other, more books contained the specified Ngram. My example shows that the term \"France\" was more often in books than \"Germany\". Why is this the case? My first thought was that in the time of the two world wars more books should have been written about Germany. The answer is simply that I wrote \"germany\" instead of \"Germany\". So it's case sensitive: Google Ngram Viewer: Germany vs. France vs. Third-Reich You can compare how successful some books are: Google Ngram Viewer: Harry Potter vs. Lord of the Rings vs. The Da Vinci Code Quite interesting is also the interest in famous physicists: Google Ngram Viewer: Famous physicists You can try all sort of things: Google Ngram Viewer: Happy Did you get some interesting results?

Those references should be formatted the same way. It is much easier to use a template for citations than trying to guess the right way how to cite. Unfortunately most Wikipedia users don't know the Template:Citation . So I try to fix all manual styled citations when I edit an article. Doing this manually is quite time intensive. This is the reason why I wrote a little Python-script.

It provides a very easy method to get some common classes. PEAR MDB2 is a database class. It is a successor of PEAR DB. I took a look at version 1.4.1 which is currently the latest stable one. Install PEAR You can install PEAR on Ubuntu via sudo apt-get install php-pear You can check if it is installed with phpinfo() : <?php phpinfo (); ?> Something like .:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear should be in your include_path . Install PEAR MDB2 PEAR MDB2 is then simply installed via sudo pear install MDB2 Then install the optional MySQL package: sudo pear install pear/MDB2#mysql Usage I took a small chess database to test this package. You can set it up with this sql file . It's sad, but only including MDB2.php shows 5 \"Deprecated\"-messages and 6 warings because of \"Strict Standards\". You can easily connect to the database: require_once \"MDB2.php\"; $db = new MDB2(); $dsn = \"mysql://chessuser:localpass@localhost/chess\"; $mdb2 = MDB2::factory($dsn); $mdb2->setFetchMode(MDB2_FETCHMODE_ASSOC); It is also very easy to fetch some data: $sql = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`'; $result = $mdb2->query($sql); while ($row = $result->fetchRow()) { print_r($row); } or $sql = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`'; $data = $mdb2->queryAll($sql); print_r($data); This results in: Array ( [user_id] => 1 [user_name] => abc [user_password] => 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72 [currentchesssoftware] => 0 ) Array ( [user_id] => 2 [user_name] => test [user_password] => 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 [currentchesssoftware] => 0 ) You can set limits via MDB2: $sql = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`'; $mdb2->setLimit(1); $data = $mdb2->queryAll($sql); print_r($data); MDB2 offers lots of other features like choosing a (non)persistent connection, prepared statements or debuggin option.

You might also want to install some codecs first: $ sudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-52 libavdevice-extra-52 libavformat-extra-52 libavutil-extra-50 libpostproc-extra-51 libswscale-extra-0 libavcodec-unstripped-52 ubuntu-restricted-extras Merge many video files to one : $ cat One.mpg Two.mpg Three.mpg | ffmpeg -f mpeg -i - -vcodec copy -acodec copy \"Merged.mpg\" avi2mpg : $ ffmpeg -i \"Original.avi\" \"New.mpg\" mp42mpg : $ ffmpeg -i \"Original.mp4\" -target ntsc-vcd \"New.mpg\" mp42mp3 : $ ffmpeg -i Original.mp4 -f mp3 -ab 192000 -vn New.mp3 mod2avi : ? mts2avi ( MTS format info ): $ ffmpeg -i 00008 .MTS -acodec copy -vcodec libx264 -crf 21 -r 30000 /1001 -deinterlace -y -threads 0 output_file.avi vcd2avi : $ mencoder vcd://2 -o \"New.avi\" -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec = mpeg4:vbitrate = 2000 ogv2avi : $ mencoder \"Original.ogv\" -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts pass = 1 -o \"New.avi\" wmv2mpg : aspect=16/9 should eventually be changed to 4/3 or other aspects $ mencoder -of avi -ofps 25 \\ -oac mp3lame -lameopts cbr:br = 112 :aq = 3 :mode = 0 :vol = 0 \\ -vf hqdn3d,softskip,harddup \\ -ovc xvid \\ -xvidencopts bitrate = 501 :max_key_interval = 37 :aspect = 16 /9:turbo:nochroma_me:notrellis:max_bframes = 0 :vhq = 0 \\ Original.wmv \\ -o New.avi mkv2avi : $ mencoder \"Original.mkv\" -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec = mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate = 6000 -oac mp3lame -lameopts vbr = 3 -o \"New.avi\" Converting Flash Videos flv to mpg You might want to get the information of the video first: $ ffmpeg -i inputVideo.flv This is how you convert it: $ ffmpeg -i inputVideo.flv -acodec libmp3lame -ab 64k -s 320x240 -r 24 outputVideo.mpg -i input file -acodec audio codec -ab audio bitrate -s size -r fps where fps is the frame rate in Hz. The default value is 25Hz. Converting Flash Videos flv to avi $ ffmpeg -i inputVideo.flv -sameq -ab 128k outputVideo.avi Shortcuts for Linux Console I convert svg2png or pdf2png quite often for my articles. So I've created a command. You can create a command in Linux very easy: Enter echo $PATH in your console Go to /usr/bin or any other path in your PATH Create a file with the name of your command (e.g. svg2png) Fill the fill (see below for some examples). Make it executable: chmod +x svg2png My svg2png looks like this: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import argparse parser = argparse . ArgumentParser ( description = \"convert a svg file to png\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"-i\" , \"--input\" , dest = \"input\" , help = \"read svg file\" , metavar = \"FILE\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"-o\" , \"--output\" , dest = \"output\" , help = \"output png file\" , metavar = \"FILE\" ) parser . add_argument ( \"-w\" , \"--width\" , dest = \"width\" , default = 512 , type = int , help = \"width of output png\" ) args = parser . parse_args () import os command = \"inkscape \" + args . input + \\ \" -w \" + str ( args . width ) + \" --export-png=\" + args . output os . system ( command ) print ( \"Executed command: \" + command ) My pdf2png looks like this: #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import argparse parser = argparse .

This includes installing and basic customization. You need to know how how to upload files and how your MySQL database credentials. I used almost the same setup and I will update this post if I make some bad experiences with it. Requirements Minimum Webserver with: MySQL 5.0 or higher PHP 5.2.4 or higher 10 MB free space Any possibility to upload files Recommended The mod_rewrite Apache module. An FTP-Client (e.g. FileZilla) Installation Download the latest version from wordpress.org Decompress it and submit it to your Webserver. It should be directly in your working directory. Example: Use www.martin-thoma.com, not www.martin-thoma.com/wordpress/ Run the installation setup Fill in your database information (database name, host, database user, database password) Store wp-config.php in your WordPress-Folder. Make the most basic configuration of your blog (give it a title, create the admin account) Plugins Akismet : Protect your blog from spam. Don't forget to add your API Key. Sociable : A little, customizable link bar with icons to share the post on social networks. I miss Google+ ☹ SyntaxHighlighter Evolved : A syntax highlighter. Absolutely necessary, if you want to write about code. If you don't write about code, you don't need it. Twitter Tools : a plugin that creates a complete integration between your WordPress blog and your Twitter account. WordPress SEO by Yoast : XML-Sitemap, binding for Google/Bing Webmaster Tools WP-Piwik : Piwik is an OpenSource alternative to Google Analytics. You can get some information about your readers.

Go to Posts → Categories Set your default category. Go to Settings → Writing Delete the \"Hello World!\" post. Delete \"Sample\" page. Set a default category in Settings → Writing. Then delete the category \"Uncategorized\". Set up a custom theme. You can find free ones on wordpress.org/extend/themes . Use Permalinks . I use /%postname%/ as I want short URLs. Another plus of this URL is that the URL never changes. Finetuning www or non-www-URL : decide if you want www.martin-thoma.com or martin-thoma.com as your standard URL. Both should work, but one should redirect the user to the other. I choose to take martin-thoma.com as I like short URLs. Add this to your .htaccess if you want www.martin-thoma.com: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond % { HTTP_HOST } !&#94;www.martin-thoma.com$ RewriteRule &#94; ( .* ) $ http://www.martin-thoma.com/ $1 [ R = 301 ] Imprint : In Germany, you have to create an imprint.
