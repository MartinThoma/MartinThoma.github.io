[Semmelknödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmelkn%C3%B6del) are a kind of
bread dumplings which are typically eaten in Bavaria (Germany).

You can buy them ready-made so that you only have to put them in water
and cook them for a while. The ready-made ones taste fine.

They are a "Reste-Essen" - a dish you can prepare with remainders of old food.
Namely old bread rolls.

Let's see how to do them by ourselfes!

## Ingredients

Semmelknödel for 4 people:

* 6 old bread rolls
* 250 ml milk
* 3 eggs
* 10 g butter
* 1 onion
* 3 soup spoons hacked [parsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley)
* salt
* pepper
* bread crumps as backup if you add too much milk / egg

Side-Dishes:

* Red cabbage: See [Apfel-Rotkohl receipe](https://www.essen-und-trinken.de/rezepte/55536-rzpt-apfel-rotkohl)
* [Sauerbraten](https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/18831004801920/Sauerbraten.html)


## Tools

* 1 big mixing bowl for milk + bread rolls
* 1 small mixing bowl for eggs
* Big pot

## Preparation

This takes about 45 minutes.

1. Cut the bread rolls into small pieces
2. Put the parsley and the onion very briefly in a pan, but don't let them get brown
3. Make milk hot (don't cook it, but almost)
4. Mix bread rolls, parsley, onion, hot milk. Wait for 10 minutes.
5. Mix eggs with salt and pepper.
6. Put the eggs to the bread rolls and mix it. The consistency of the dough should not be too firm.
7. Add [bread crumbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_crumbs) if the dough is too fluid
8. Put water in the big pot and make it hot. It should boil slightly (not too hot).
9. Wet your hands (not in the boiling water, of course!) and create balls which are roughly of the size of Tennis balls. Put them in the hot water.
10. Wait for 20 minutes. When they are ready, they should rise to the top.
