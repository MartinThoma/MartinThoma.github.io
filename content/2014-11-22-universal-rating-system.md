A key feature of Amazon is its rating system. Rating systems are relatively
straight-forward to build, but they need much data and get better with more
data. I think Amazon builds a monopoly that way. However, I also think we
could build an Universal Rating System (URS).

Just as important as pure rating are reviews.


## What would an URS need?

Directly neccessary are

* **Identification of people**: The same person should not be able to write
  multiple reviews or make multiple ratings for the same product. It is not
  important to tell which online-identity belongs to which person. In fact, I
  think it would be good if it was possible to keep users anonym while making
  sure that everybody has only one online-identity.
* **Identification of products**: Users have to be able to find products and
  they have to find reviews to that product. So some kind of product
  identification number is necessary.
* **Ratings for reviews**
* **Uploading photographs**
* **Product description**: This should be objective.

Indirectly necessary are

* **Recommendations**: If users see that they get good recommendations from
  an independant source they might use the system. If they see that those
  recommendations imporve with more reviews and more ratings, they add more
  of them. This way the system gets better.
* **Possibility to compare products**: Examples are
  [phonearena.com](http://www.phonearena.com/), [ark.intel.com](http://ark.intel.com/)
  and others. But they are always limited to some products.
* **Search**: Users should be able to search for a product by specifying it.
  This could be a price range, a category, a review average, a minimum number
  of reviews, ...
* **Easy login**: Something like OpenID that makes it easy for users to
  create an account and sign in.
* **Right incentives*: Having a great community is much about giving the right
  incentives. Badages and Karma are a great way to do so as shown with
  StackExchange.

Non-software parts

* **Advertisment**: People have to get informed about such a system.
* **Organization**: The software should be OpenSource, the data should be
  published (as far as possible without breaking privacy) and
  the organization which runs the software should be a nonprofit organization.
  The reason is simply that it prevents abuse.
* **Product registration**: Companies should have the possibility to register
  their products to get an identification number.
* **Project name**: A good name is important. Any ideas?


## Existing Projects

Does anybody know if such a project already exists?

If there is no such project by now: Is anybody interested in working on it?
