We are currently experiencing an inflation. I'm not sure if the price increases
for everyday goods are already over, but I'll make another "snapshot" of what
I see. I wrote the first [cost of living in 2019](https://martin-thoma.com/cost-of-living/).

I'm writing this from Germany, close to Munich. Most of the groceries are from
Aldi, Lidl, or DM.

In order to detect shrinkflation, I'll always add the amount.

This is work in progress.

There are multiple reasons for the price increases:

* The [Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War):
  Especially sunflower oil is affected by this, but also energy prices are
  driving everything else up.
* Cooperations increasing their margins

## Apartment

For two people, you will need about 60m². We had to move at the worst time and
pay a rent of 1600 €/month (including heating and other service charges) for
a 66m² apartment with a 12m² balcony and a cellar. As half of the area of the
balcony is typically counted, we pay about 22.22 €/m². The center of Munich is
about 19km away.

## Energy

This depends heavily on the region. My wife and me need a bit less than 1800 kWh/year.
In my region, the cheapest contract for 1800 kWh/year is:

* Base price: 124.80 €/year
* Energy price: 0.3367 €/kWh

That makes about 731 €/year in total.

## Internet

If you are over 27 and if you make good use of portals to get good deals, the
best you can get with DSL connections (no volume limitations, average price per
month if you make a 2-year contract, assuming you have your own router) is:

* 100 MBit/s downstream: 30.16 €/month
* 250 MBit/s downstream: 37.07 €/month
* 500 MBit/s downstream: 67.49 €/month

Faster connections are not available.
Prices for (TV) cable connections are cheaper, but I had several times bad
experience with their reliability.

## Broadcasting Fees

Although we don't use it, we have to pay broadcasting fees ("[Rundfunkgebühren](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundfunkbeitrag)").
Currently, that is 22.94 €/month.


## Subscriptions

We only use Netflix, but here is an overview:

Video Streaming:

* Netflix: 17.99 €/month
* Disney+: 8.99 €/month
* Amazon Prime: 8.99 €/month
