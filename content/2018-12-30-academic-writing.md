<div class="info">This is an article I had for quite a while as a draft. As part of my yearly cleanup, I've published it without finishing it. It might not be finished or have other problems.</div>
While writing my thesis, I came across some rules / resources which I would
like to share with you.


## Tools

* [Academic-Writing-Check](https://github.com/devd/Academic-Writing-Check)
* `aspell`


## Rules and Guidelines

* However at the beginning of a sentence might not mean what you think. See
  [Strunk](http://www.bartleby.com/141/strunk3.html).
* If a sentence ends with a capital letter, add `\@` before the dot.
* Avoid "it" and "this" if possible. Be explicit. Being explicit makes it
  easier to read your work.

## Miscallenious

* [Is “data” treated as singular or plural in formal contexts?](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/6913/9880)
* [‘Less’ or ‘fewer’?](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/less-or-fewer)
* Look for "make"
* "I", "we" or "the author"?
