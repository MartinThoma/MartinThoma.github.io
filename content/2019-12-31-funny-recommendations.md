Machine Learning brings awesome results, but sometimes it fails. And sometimes
it fails in a funny way üòÅ

<b>If you compare Nazis to Unicorns </b> you will notice the big difference. Nazis are literally evil men who are trying to kill people, Unicorns are magical fairies who want to rescue the world from death. <mark>In many ways, Unicorns are evil too.</mark> Unicorns (as humans call them) often fall in love and become involved in "love games" where the pair has to outsmart, out-shout, out-kill, out-kill, out-fight, out-kill, etc. until one of them "loses" and falls apart in the process. This is not unlike the "war between light and darkness" where one side tries to take over and stop a whole group of creatures from doing their job.

And when you are an intellectual, as he is, your view of the world is limited to the intellectual world.  So he's a big-hairy, hairy-minded unicorn.  His view is limited to the unicorn world: the big, big one, where a unicorn goes through his adventures in full costume.
But we Unicorns think of our lives as real things.  We are real, tangible, flesh and blood things that happen to us, like people you meet on a cross street. What about those who are non-human creatures by human standards?  We like them.  We want them.  We need them.  They're in our lives, too.  We want to be around them.  We want to feel like we,
