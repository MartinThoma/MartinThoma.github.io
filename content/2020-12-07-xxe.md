XML is probably the most commonly used markup language. Itâ€™s organized around tags `<example>foo</example>` and allows pretty complicated structures

One interesting property about XML is that you can reference external entities, e.g. you can include another file. That is where the name XXE comes from: **X**ML e**x**ternal **e**ntities. Letâ€™s start!

## Why you should care

* XXE vulnerabilities can allow attackers to **steal your data**, **scan your internal network**, and even allow **remote code execution** (RCE)
* XXE attacks were number 4 in the **OWASP Top 10**
* The [Twitter Tag #XXE](https://twitter.com/hashtag/XXE?src=hashtag_click) is pretty active. So people are still interested in it, although the vulnerability was first recognized already in 2002 ([source](https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/303509))
* 2012: An XXE vulnerability was discovered in **Inkscape** ([source](https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/1025185))
* 2014: **Google** was vulnerable to XXE and paid a bug bounty of **$10,000** ([source](https://blog.detectify.com/2014/04/11/how-we-got-read-access-on-googles-production-servers/))
* 2014: **Adobe Reader** had an XXE vulnerability ([source](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-8452/))
* 2015: Mohamed Ramadan discovered an XXE vulnerability in **Facebooks** resume upload ([source](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/31677/hacking/hacking-facebook-word-document.html))
* 2020: **IBM QRadar** had an XXE vulnerability ([source](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4510))

## We donâ€™t use XML!

Here are some indicators that you might need to care:

* Youâ€™re using [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)
* Youâ€™re using [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
* Youâ€™re reading office files, such as Word (docx) or [Excel files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) (xlsx; [example](https://github.com/StefanMichielse/generate_xxe_payloads), [example](https://github.com/jmcnamara/excel-reader-xlsx/issues/10)). Powerpoint (pptx) contains XML as well. All of them are essentially ZIP archives with lots of XML files inside. I donâ€™t think that Word / Excel / Powerpoint are vulnerable, but maybe the smaller libraries around those files that are used to programmatically create or read them.
* Youâ€™re reading [XMP meta data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform) from images such as JPG or GIF ([presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZUlw8hHp44), [slides](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/webcast/11192015-exploiting-xml-entity-vulnerabilities-in-file-parsing-functionality.pdf)), meta data from audio and video files as well.
* Youâ€™re reading PDF files
* SVGs are XML as well.

The [oxml_xxe tool](https://github.com/BuffaloWill/oxml_xxe) makes it pretty easy to generate such a malicious file.

## Types of XXEs

* Inband: The output is shown to the attacker
* Out of band (OOB): The attacker is blind

### Inband XXE

```python
from lxml import etree

xml = """<root>Hello World!</root>"""
parser = etree.XMLParser()
doc = etree.fromstring(xml.encode(), parser)
parsed_xml = etree.tostring(doc).decode("utf8")
print(parsed_xml)
```

Looks harmless, doesnâ€™t it? It simply prints <root>Hello World!</root>

But if you change the xml string, then you can read the users passwords:

```python
from lxml import etree

xml = """
<!DOCTYPE XML [
<!ENTITY ee SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >
]>
<root>&ee;</root>
"""
parser = etree.XMLParser()
doc = etree.fromstring(xml.encode(), parser)
parsed_xml = etree.tostring(doc).decode("utf8")
print(parsed_xml)
```

If this was part of a server, then the user could read arbitrary files on that
server.

### Out-of-Band XXE

Most of the time, the attacker cannot see the result of the parsed XML file
directly. Hence inband XXE is not possible. And maybe errors are also captured,
so an error-based XXE does also not work.

However, the attacker might be able to force the server to make HTTP calls.
This is called server-side request forgery (SSRF). Then the attacker sets up a
listener, forces the server to make a request, and thus confirms that XXE is
possible. The Attack looks similar to the lines above and is pretty well
explained here:

* [Out-of-band XML External Entity (OOB-XXE)](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/band-xml-external-entity-oob-xxe/)
* [What is a blind XXE attack? Tutorial & Examples](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind)


## Mitigations

The simplest mitigation is to limit the capabilities of XML to a safe subset.
Meaning that you need to limit the XML parser youâ€™re using.

Python has [5 XML
parsers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html#xml-vulnerabilities):
[sax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.reader.html#module-xml.sax.xmlreader),
etree, minidom, pulldom, xmlrpc. According to the documentation, they are safe
to use. However, [lxml](https://lxml.de/) is wide-spread. It mentions that you
should configure the XML to not load external DTDs
([source](https://lxml.de/FAQ.html#how-do-i-use-lxml-safely-as-a-web-service-endpoint)).
The [defusedxml](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/) package offers a way to
access XML parsers with a secure default configuration.
