I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ40. It's about 3 years old and I'm thinking
about getting a new one. I have the impression that my camera takes quite often
unsharp images.


## What is important to me

* **Sharp images**
* Not too bulky - it should fit in the side bag of my Deuter Air Contact 55+10
  (like the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ40)
* Correct / nice colors: This is where I expect an improvement compared to the
  Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ40
* **Grip**: I want to be able to make selfies with it
* **On/off**: Similar to the grip one - I don't want to accidentially turn it on / off.
* **Price** should at maximum be 700 EUR. Rather something like 500 EUR, but more
  than 300 EUR is fine.
* Battery life: I want to be able to have the camera with me for a day with one
  battery. So I guess something like 150 shots should easily be possible.

The kind of image I want to take:

* Landscape while hiking / climbing: Sunsets, pictures of/from mountains
* City photos
* Food

Optional:

* GPS: I like when my images are geo-tagged.


## What is not important

* Touch screen
* NFC
* Video
