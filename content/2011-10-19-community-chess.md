Community Chess is one of my projects. I can make something useful and play a bit.
This project has now an own URL:
[community-chess.com](http://community-chess.com/)

It's a little bit crappy at the moment as I've just started studying, but I'll
fix that.

If you like to help, please write me an e-mail (info@martin-thoma.de).
Everybody can help. Here are some examples:

I need some people who
<ul>
  <li>can create a better design / color scheme</li>
  <li>use it and know chess rules</li>
  <li>know how to customize phpBB</li>
  <li>know how to write Ajax for a better GUI (playChess.php works with PHP and HTML at the moment)</li>
  <li>can speak other languages than English and German</li>
  <li>know how to advertise</li>
  <li>like to support this project with money (I have to pay 26.16 Euro per year for hosting this service. If I get more money I will save it for the next years hosting costs. If it's much more I could try to find a professional designer.)</li>
</ul>
