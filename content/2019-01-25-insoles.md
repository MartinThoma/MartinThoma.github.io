Shoes come in many shapes, but they don't fit perfectly for every foot. While
we choose shoes by length, the width of feet, the height, and the area which
touches the floor when standing on a flat surface is different. Insoles can
make a shoe which has the right length / enough width more comfortable.

My "[Au√üenrist](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C3%9Fenrist)" (top part of my foot) usually hurts after longer hikes. I want
to fix that. The idea is that I can maybe push some parts of my foot more up,
so that the force is more equally distributed.

I tried the currex EdgePro one for a week or so, but my calfs began to hurt.
Then I switched to the Meindl Vacuum MFS. Way better. Also way cheaper (13 EUR vs 44 EUR).

## Currex

The series:

* EdgePro: Hiking, Trekking, Skiing
* RunPro and RunFree: Running
* ActivePro: Tennis, Soccer
* BikePro
* WorkPro: Work

Then you have to choose your [profile](http://www.currexsole.com/DE/de/insoles/#/edgepro):

* Low
* Mid
* High

I'm not too sure if the sizes match that:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>German Size</th>
        <th>Currex</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>34 . -36</td>
        <td>XS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>36.5 - 38.5</td>
        <td>S</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>39 - 41</td>
        <td>M</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>41.5 - 43.5</td>
        <td>L</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>44 - 46</td>
        <td>XL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>46.5 - 48</td>
        <td>XXL</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## SuperFeet

* Blue: 2.5cm profile height, for medium arches
* Berry: 2.8cm profile height, women-specific (slimmer heel and arch)
* Black: 2.4cm profile height, slimmest, lowest profile, for low arches
* Carbon: 2.8cm profile height
* hotPink: 2.0cm profile height, women-specifc (narrower), foil lining at forefoot to make it warmer
* Yellow: 2.5cm profile height, for skating / ice skates
* BlackDMP: 3.3cm profile height, Dynamic Molding Process (Memory Foam); for people with sensitive feet
* 3/4: For work, they are not full length to make it easier to fit inside
