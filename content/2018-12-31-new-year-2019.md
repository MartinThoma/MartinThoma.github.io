It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2018

Not a lot happened about which I want to write publicly, so here are some other
mentionable facts:

* [ML-KA](https://ml-ka.de/) is still active.
* I have 40&thinsp;583&nbsp;points on StackOverflow and reached 22.4&nbsp;million people
  with my posts ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/martin-thoma)).
* I wrote only 48&nbsp;articles for this blog (including this one, not counting 13 ones which were pulished yesterday) in 2018. A couple
  of them might be interesting:
      * [Nepal](https://martin-thoma.com/nepal)
      * [Datetime](https://martin-thoma.com/datetime/) - or even better my short summary [What every developer should know about time](https://zenodo.org/record/1443533)
      * A couple about details in Python such as [packaging](https://martin-thoma.com/python-projects/), [str vs repr](https://martin-thoma.com/str-vs-repr/), [property](https://martin-thoma.com/python-property/), [testing](https://martin-thoma.com/testing-python-code/), [style guide](https://martin-thoma.com/python-style-guide/)
      * A couple of shorter data science related ones, such as an [overview](https://martin-thoma.com/data-science/), a [project guide](https://martin-thoma.com/ds-project-guide/), the problems of [Feature Importance](https://martin-thoma.com/feature-importance/), [time series forecasting](https://martin-thoma.com/forecasting/)
      * Only [one recipe](https://martin-thoma.com/bala-bala/)!
* I've uploaded 195&nbsp;files to Wikipedia Commons in 2018 (2164 files in total, <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/ptools/uploadsum.php?user=MartinThoma">source</a>). My uploads to Wikipedia Commons
  are about 6&thinsp;GiB in total now. On commons, I made 5333&nbsp;edits in total.

Interesting changes in my life:

* I moved within Munich on 01.06.2017
* Found a couple of new friends ðŸ™‚

Overall, I have to say that I spent a lot of time with working. Maybe too much
time. I've noticed that I contributed a lot less to Wikipedia, wrote less blog
articles of lower quality and spent less time on StackOverflow.


### Old year resolutions

* <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Participate in a Flashmob
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> Visiting a new country - I've been in the [Czech Republic](https://martin-thoma.com/prague/)


### Old year predictions

I forgot to make predictions last year ðŸ˜¨


## New year resolutions

The plans for my new year are:

* <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Get comfortable with Orange Bouldering routes (5c-6c) and finish at least
      5 harder ones (6c - 7b)â€¦ yes, I'm aware that I had exactly that already.
      I wasn't bouldering for a while. I miss it.
* [ ] Create a GAN for my [HASYv2 dataset](https://arxiv.org/a/thoma_m_1.html)
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> Create at least 10 more blog posts with recipes: [1](https://martin-thoma.com/pho/), [2](https://martin-thoma.com/siomay-ayam/), [3](https://martin-thoma.com/vegetable-curry/), [4](https://martin-thoma.com/sandwich/), [5](https://martin-thoma.com/lasagne/), [6](https://martin-thoma.com/shrimps-and-tofu/), [7](https://martin-thoma.com/apple-pancakes/), [8](https://martin-thoma.com/semmelknoedel/), [9](https://martin-thoma.com/carrot-soup), [10](https://martin-thoma.com/cantuccini/)
* [ ] Create at least 10 high-quality Media files for Wikipedia: [1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Trigonomatric-functions.svg),
      [2](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2d-chi-squared-pdf.svg),
      [3](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2d-chi-squared-cdf.svg),


## Finishing things

I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially
cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash.

* <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">âœ“</span> Deleting several hundret E-mails (over 500 unread e-mails, 824 starred e-mails)
* [ ] Clean up my smartphones TODO list.
* [ ] Clean up my Desktop / Download folder.
* <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">âœ“</span> Make Backup of Google+ and Gmail ([takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)), WhatsApp ([tutorial](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/android/23756533)), Amazon, Banking. I skipped Facebook ([tutorial](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467)) and Twitter ([tutorial](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170320)) this year.
* <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">âœ“</span> Push git stuff
* [ ] Remove things from my YouTube "Watch Later" list


## Predictions for 2019

Machine Learning and Technology

1. Tensorflow will keep being the dominant deep learning framework as measured
   by (1) StackOverflow questions, (2) Google Trend, (3) Github repositories
2. There will still not be a DOTA playing AI which can replace a human DOTA
   player in a human team with the usual flexibility.
3. We will see fraud cases related to ML (e.g. using speech synthesis for identity theft or tricking a ML system).


About Me

4. ~ I will come back well from [Nepal](https://martin-thoma.com/nepal).
5. I will write at least 10 summaries of papers on [cs.CV](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent).
6. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> I will learn and fully understand how Flask Blueprints work.
7. I will reach level 5 on the first 15 lessons for Spanish on Duolingo and
   level 3 on the next 13 ones. (So far: 6 on Level 5, 8 on Level 3)


The bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World

8. <span style="color:green;" title="The 250th happend 2nd of August already.">&#x2714;</span> There will be over 250 mass shootings in the US in 2019. I define a mass
   shooting as anything where at least 4 people get injured by a gun. ([List of mass shootings in the United States in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2019))
9. <span style="color:green;" title="35 days it was">&#x2714;</span> The government shutdown will last at least 20 days, but no more than 40 days. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_United_States_federal_government_shutdown"><span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span></a>
10. <span style="color:green;" title="Impeachment started, but he still is in office">&#x2714;</span> Trump will still be in office


There are also a couple of predictions which I don't know how to check, e.g.

* The hype of Machine Learning and data science will go down a bit as companies
  are faced with problems / the reality. It will still be important, though.
* Amazing results by GANs. [Large Scale Gan Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11096.pdf) is already pretty awesome. I expect more of this, easier to use for non-ml developers.
