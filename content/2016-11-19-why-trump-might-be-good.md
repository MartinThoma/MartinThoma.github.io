After Trump became elected president of the United States, a lot of people
began writing as if the world is going to end. While I also fear many bad
things that might happen, here are some things that might be good:

1. Some people got a lot of money from bets ([source](http://time.com/money/4565236/donald-trump-2016-election-win-gambling-bets/)).
2. Trump things drone attacks are too expensive (about $320&thinsp;000 according to [this source](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-one-airstrike-cost/answer/Christopher-Troskosky?srid=vW2s)). However, he also wants to bomb the shit out of terrorists ([source](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-drone-strikes-bombing-isis-pirates-no-rules-obama-deaths-a7423401.html)).
3. Trump is against TTIP.
4. Trump wants to have good relationships to Russia.
5. It might be easier for us to get what we want from the US. Just compliment Trump ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5TDTDJzSU))
6. The brick industry is going to go through the roof! ([source](http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/a-1120551.html))
7. House of Cards can finally get that Emmy in the "documentary" category
8. Alec Baldwin can become a full-time Trump impersonator
9. I have a question with over 10&thinsp;000 views on politics.SE ([source](http://politics.stackexchange.com/q/9844/2846))
10. Speaches are easier to understand due to the simple vocabulary.
11. We will get more funny videos [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCo_XypJJus).
12. The "Deutsche Bank" will be stronger ([source](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/10/trump-presidency-could-be-worth-14-billion-to-his-troubled-lender/))
