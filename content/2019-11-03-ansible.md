Ansible is a configuration management tool maintained by Red Hat. It has to be
installed on a controll machine. On the target machine, no configuration is
needed. The control machine connects to the target machines via SSH.


## Which problem does it solve?

**In short**: Ansible makes configurations repeatable.

Why this is good:

* Disaster Recovery: You have a web service running on AWS. Your account was
  hacked and deleted. Having your infrastructure defined as code (IaC), you can
  re-create all resources with the configuration you had before.
* Site Reliability: Having IaC, you can have code reviews for changes. This
  helps to reduce human error.
* Scalability: If we want to add more services, it is easier to repeat
  patterns. So this might help different teams at a company to keep in sync.

**In long**:

If you have a web service running, you hopefully have the code for that service
under version control (e.g. `git`).

Version control helps to keep the same state
everywhere, find the changes ([`git bisect`](https://github.com/takluyver/bisect-demo) ([docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect)) / [`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame)),
undo the change ([`git revert`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert)). So the
version control gives you documentation and archives changes.

However, if you have a web service running, the software is not the only
important thing. It has to run somewhere. This means you actually need a
physical machine. You don't need to own it / take care about the hardware, but
it needs to exist. Suppose you use Amazons Cloud AWS. Then you can use
[Terraform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)) / [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) to define in code on which kinds of
machines it is running. The idea to have this written in code is called
[Infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC).
It allows you to have the infrastructure under version control and get the same
benefits as were mentioned about version control for code.

Next, you need to configure the machines: Add certificates, SSH keys, LDAP,
install Docker. This is where Ansible helps.

## Installation

Ansible is written in Python. For this reason, the simplest way to install it
might be via the Python Package installer `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install ansible
```

To test if it worked:

```bash
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.0
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/home/moose/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/moose/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /home/moose/.local/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.6.8 (default, Oct  7 2019, 12:59:55) [GCC 8.3.0]
```


## Vocabulary

<dl>
    <dt>Task</dt>
    <dd>A task is a command executed on the target machine. A task is a call to an Ansible module.</dd>
    <dt>Role</dt>
    <dd>A list of tasks. Every role is a directory below <code>/roles</code> and contains a `main.yml` which defines the tasks.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html">Playbook</a></dt>
    <dd>Determines which task/role should be applied to which target machine. </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variables-discovered-from-systems-facts">Facts</a></dt>
    <dd>Facts are information derived from speaking with your remote systems.</dd>
    <dt>Idempotency</dt>
    <dd>An idempotent operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Basically, it means "repeatable".</dd>
    <dt>Convergence</dt>
    <dd>Bring resources to a desired state if they diverge</dd>
    <dt>Immutability</dt>
    <dd>Resources are never changed. They are only created and destroyed. (Terraform and CloudFormation work like this)</dd>

## Usage

Ad hoc command to check the connection:

```bash
$ ansible -m ping all
```

Ad hoc command to get the available disk space:

```bash
# ansible -m [module] -a '[module options]' [target]
$ ansible -m shell -a 'df -h' all
```

Ansible executes stuff with your account. If you need root, specify `-b` and
`-k` to ask for a password.

The default project structure is:

```text
.
├── playbook.yml
└── roles
    ├── example-role
    │   ├── files
    │   │   └── foo.txt
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── main.yml
    └── foo-role
        └── tasks
            └── main.yml
```

The `main.yml` files have the following structure:

```yaml
# Choose a descriptive name for the task as ansible will print them when
# executing
- name: Install a list of packages
  apt:  # The ansible module
    pkg: # install the following packages
    - foo
    - bar
- name: Add some file to the target machines
  copy:
    src: ../files/foo.txt
    dest: /absolute/path/foo.txt
```

The `playbook.yml` file has the following structure:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: true  # become another user; by default root
```

You can then execute the playbook via

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

## Alternatives

[Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(company)#Puppet) and [Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(software)) are two other configuration management tools which are often used.

Where Ansible is push-based, Puppet and Chef are pull-based. So the target
machines need to have an agent running which pulls.
