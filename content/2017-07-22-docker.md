Docker is a tool which allows developers to make deployment of their software
easier.

Imagine you have a web service. Then you usually not only have your own
software, but you built it with other libraries. You run it on a web server.
The server needs some configuration, exposes some ports, reads and writes data.
Being a good developer, you identified different components which can be built
(and scaled) independently (aka microservices). They have a way to talk with
each other and they need to run in order to make the service work. As you are
the developer, you know what you need. But you might not be the one who deploys
the software. Hence you have to write documentation about it.

And you can create a (Docker) container.


## Glossary

<dl>
    <dt>Image</dt>
    <dd>An image is an immutable file which contains the application code, the
        operating system, the required software. They are created with
        <code>docker build</code>. Images can be stored in a registry
        such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">hub.docker.com</a>.
        An image is defined using a <code>Dockerfile</code>.
        Typically, an image is built on another image.<br/>
        You can list images on your machine with <code>docker images</code>.</dd>
    <dt>Container</dt>
    <dd>A virtual operating system. It is an instance of an image. A container
        is created with <code>docker run</code>. A methaphor used by
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23735149/docker-image-vs-container/26960888#26960888">paislee</a>
        is that an image is a class and a container is an object. They
        encapsulate the environment in which the application runs.<br/>
        <code>docker ps -a</code> lists all containers - running and stopped.</dd>

## Context

### Containers vs Virtual Machines

* **Resource sharing / isolation**: Docker containers share resources. A docker
  container is similar to a host process, hence the memory / CPU scheduling will
  be handled by the host for Docker. Docker is less isolated than a VM. Docker
  containers use less disk space and less memory.
* **Startup time**: A VM takes minutes to start, Docker takes seconds to start
* **Kernel**: Docker containers share the same kernel (the host kernel) whereas
  each virtual machine has its own kernel.


### Alternatives

Although Docker seems to be by far the most common container tool, there are
alternatives:

* [Rocket](https://coreos.com/rkt)
* [LXD](https://www.ubuntu.com/containers/lxd)
* [Flockport](https://www.flockport.com/)

And there are VMs:

* [VirtualBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox)
* [VMware Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_Workstation)


## Using Docker

First, [install Docker](https://askubuntu.com/q/938700/10425).

### Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` defines an image. It is a simple text file which could look
as follows:

```
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL maintainer="info@martin-thoma.de"
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev build-essential
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

Let's go through it:

* `FROM` defines on which base image we built our image. We add another layer
  to that one.
* `LABEL`: Add metadata in a `key=value` based fashion to the image.
* `RUN <command>`: Execute this.
* `COPY <src> <dest>`: Copy files from `src` on the host to `dest` in the container.
* `WORKDIR /abs/path/to/workdir`: Work directory for and `RUN`, `CMD`,
  `ENTRYPOINT` instruction that follows
* `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]`: Run this when the Docker
  container is started.
* `CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]`: The command is to run via the entrypoint.


### Commands

Docker needs to be run in super-user mode. I indicate that with `#`. You can
run `sudo su` in order to run all subsequent commands as a superuser.

List all images:

```
# docker image ls
```

List all running containers:

```
# docker container ls
```

Go into an interactive (`-i`) bash in a pseudo-tty (`-t`) in a container with ID `4f7d3f0763ad`:

```
# docker exec -it 4f7d3f0763ad bash
```

### Volumes

If you copy the code directly into the image, you need to rebuild the image
every time you make a change to the code. In order to prevent this, you can use
volumes. There are two types of volumes:

1. Persist and share data between containers
2. Share folders between host and containers

List volumes:

```
# docker volume ls
```

Remove volumes:

```
# docker volume rm <volume name>
```

### docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` is a [YAML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
which defines multi-container applications. It looks like this:

```
version: '3'  # Version number of the docker-compose file format
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: app.py
    ports:
     - "8082:5000"
    volumes:
     - .:/code
    links:
     - db
    hostname: myappserver
    environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd123
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=flask_db
    - MYSQL_HOST=db
    - MYSQL_PORT=3306
  db:
    image: mysql
    ports:
    - "3307:3306"
    environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd123
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=flask_db
    - MYSQL_HOST=mysqlserver
    volumes:
      - ./flask_db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/flask_db.sql
```

Start it with `docker-compose up`.

The host name of each service is the name of the service itself.


### Cleanup

Kill all running containers:

```
sudo docker kill $(sudo docker ps -q)
```

Delete all stopped containers

```
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
```

Delete all images

```
sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q)
```
