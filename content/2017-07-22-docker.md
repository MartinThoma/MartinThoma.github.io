Docker is a tool which allows developers to make deployment of their software
easier.

Imagine you have a web service. Then you usually not only have your own
software, but you built it with other libraries. You run it on a web server.
The server needs some configuration, exposes some ports, reads and writes data.
Being a good developer, you identified different components which can be built
(and scaled) independently. They have a way to talk with each other and they
need to run in order to make the service work. As you are the developer, you
know what you need. But you might not be the one who deploys the software.
Hence you have to write documentation about it.

And you can create a (Docker) container.


## Glossary

<dl>
    <dt>Image</dt>
    <dd>An image is an immutable file. They are created with
        <code>docker build</code>. Images can be stored in a registry
        such as <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">hub.docker.com</a>.
        Typically, an image is built on another image.<br/>
        You can list images on your machine with <code>docker images</code>.</dd>
    <dt>Container</dt>
    <dd>A virtual operating system. It is an instance of an image. A container
        is created with <code>docker run</code>. A methaphor used by
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23735149/docker-image-vs-container/26960888#26960888">paislee</a>
        is that an image is a class and a container is an object. They
        encapsulate the environment in which the application runs.<br/>
        <code>docker ps -a</code> lists all containers - running and stopped.</dd>
    <dt>Docker Compose</dt>
    <dd>A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.</dd>
    <dt>Docker Swarm</dt>
    <dd>A tool to deploy containers in a cluster. Similar to Kubernetes.</dd>

## Containers vs Virtual Machines

* **Resource sharing / isolation**: Docker containers share resources. A docker
  container is similar to a host process, hence the memory / CPU scheduling will
  be handled by the host for Docker. Docker is less isolated than a VM
* **Startup time**: A VM takes minutes to start, Docker takes seconds to start


## Alternatives

Although Docker seems to be by far the most common container tool, there are
alternatives:

* [Rocket](https://coreos.com/rkt)
* [LXD](https://www.ubuntu.com/containers/lxd)
* [Flockport](https://www.flockport.com/)

And there are VMs:

* [VirtualBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox)
* [VMware Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_Workstation)


## Cleanup

Kill all running containers:

```
sudo docker kill $(sudo docker ps -q)
```

Delete all stopped containers

```
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
```

Delete all images

```
sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q)
```
