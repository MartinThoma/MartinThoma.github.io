[Fitness trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_tracker) are devices
which measure things like walked distance and heartbeats. They are usually
writstbands.

I recently got excited by them and gave them a try. I tried the Mi Band 4. It
is one of the cheapest fitness bands which still had very good reviews.

I was not happy with it. There were two things I hoped it could do:

1. Sleep Tracking: Log when I sleep. Enough sleep is important to be healthy,
   so I want to keep track of it.
2. Activity Tracking: How do I spend my day? When do I do which sport?

Both of them were not good enough:

1. The sleep tracking basically tracked when I went to bed / when I stood up.
   Which can be very different from sleep. It especially did not notice when I
   woke up in the middle of the night.
2. When I started the workout tracking (cycling) via the band, it seemingly did
   not track the GPS trace (although I had my phone with me). When I stopped,
   it did not notice it at all.

Additionally, the wristband is not super comfortable and the display got
activated when I showered.

Bad:

* Uncomfortable

## Fitness Apps

A core part of a fitness tracker is the fitness app. Sadly so. It should be
possible to use any fitness tracker with any fitness app, but at the moment
(November 2019), this is definitely not the case.

### Mi Fit

There is another app - [Notify & Fitness for Mi Band](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mc.miband1). It is ok, but you have to pay for every single feature:
