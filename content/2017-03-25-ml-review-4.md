This Review gives an overview of intersting stuff I stumbled over which are
related to machine learning.


## New Developments

<!-- * [Tensorflow 1.0 is released](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-10.html)
 -->

## Live Demos and Websites


<!-- * [universe.openai.com](https://universe.openai.com/): Related to the OpenAI gym.
* [Project Malmo](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/03/13/project-malmo-using-minecraft-build-intelligent-technology/): Train RL agents in Minecraft
* [VISIIR](http://visiir.lip6.fr/): VIsual Seek for Interactive Image Retrieval - classifying food
* [Image-to-Image](http://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/index.html) -->




## Publications

<!-- e.g. arXiv -->

<!-- * [High-Resolution Image Inpainting using Multi-Scale Neural Patch Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09969) and [Code](https://github.com/leehomyc/High-Res-Neural-Inpainting)
* [The Game Imitation: Deep Supervised Convolutional Networks for Quick Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05663.pdf) and [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvesq6LEQxg&list=PLegUCwsQzmnUpPwVv8ygMa19zNnDgJ6OC&index=1)
* [Deep Nets Don't Learn Via Memorization](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJv6ZgHYg) -->

## Software

<!-- e.g. Theano, Keras, ... -->

* [Pi-DeepLearning](https://github.com/Pi-DeepLearning/RaspberryPi-FaceDetection-MTCNN-Caffe-With-Motion) ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5xrt2m/pmtcnn_face_detection_on_raspberry_pi_3_with/))
* [DeepDetect](https://deepdetect.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect))


## Interesting Questions

<!-- For example StackExchange -->

<!-- * [Why is the accuracy of my CNN not reproducible?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42326466/why-is-the-accuracy-of-my-cnn-not-reproducible)
* [How much does a GPU instance cost?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/5s0jnc/how_much_does_a_gpu_instance_cost/) -->


<!-- ## Miscallenious

### Trump QA idea

I was just watching [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSx-N9ayCvU&feature=youtu.be&t=3m40s) and wodered how well a question answering system would work which is trained on Trump speaches. Very often, when reporters / journalists / moderators ask Trump a question, he answers with "I am the [most / best / least] [positive / negative statement]. [Inconsistent answer follows]".
The answers themself would almost certainly be hilarous. Second, one could make an experiment and ask people if Trump actually answered a question like this. -->
