The [hierarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) is a
psychological theory proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943. It suggests that human
needs can be arranged in a hierarchy, with basic physiological needs at the
bottom and self-actualization at the top. The hierarchy is often depicted as a
pyramid, with the most fundamental needs at the base and higher-level needs
building upon them.

Let's examine which companies operate within each level of this hierarchy.

## Physiological needs

### Water

* **Tap Water**: Most drinking water is supplied as tap water by municipal
         waterworks. However, bottled water is also available at a premium.
         In Germany, tap water costs approximately 0.0025€/L while bottled water
         starts at 0.20€/L—about 80 times more expensive. Municipal
         waterworks also manage the sewage system and wastewater treatment,
         providing more comprehensive water services per unit sold than bottled water companies.
    * [SWM Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtwerke_M%C3%BCnchen):
      11.604 employees, revenue of €7 billion (2024), providing water to 1.5
      million people. The service area likely extends beyond Munich to include
      surrounding areas. They also operate public baths, public transport,
      electricity, and telecommunications.
    * [Berliner Wasserbetriebe](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Wasserbetriebe):
      4.751 employees, revenue of €1.3 billion (2023), providing 211 million m³ of
      water to approximately 3.5 million people (about 165 L per person per day, generating approximately 0.006€/L in revenue).
* **Bottled Water**: The bottled water market is dominated by a few large companies:
    * [Nestle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9) (Perrier, S.Pellegrino)
    * [Danone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danone) (Evian, Volvic, Aqua)
    * [PepsiCo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo) (Aquafina, LIFEWTR, SodaStream)
    * [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company) (Dasani, Smartwater, Ciel, Bonaqua)

### Food
* **Primary Food Production**: Similar to water, there is primary food
  production through agriculture, livestock, and fishing.
* **Food Processing**: The food processing industry is dominated by a few large
  companies that control a significant portion of the market. These companies
  often have a wide range of products and brands, making it difficult for
  smaller competitors to gain market share.
    * [Nestle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9)
    * [PepsiCo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo)

    * [Unilever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever)
    * [Kraft Heinz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kraft_Heinz_Company)

### Energy

Energy needs should be divided into categories: electricity and fossil fuels. Due to
climate change, we need to transition away from fossil fuels and electrify heating
and transportation. This means moving from oil and gas to heat pumps, and
from gasoline and diesel to electric vehicles. Therefore, let's focus on
electricity.

* **Primary Electricity Production**: Operating power plants to generate
  electricity, including fossil fuel, nuclear, and renewable energy
  sources.
    * [RWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWE)
    * [EnBW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnBW)
    * [Vattenfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vattenfall)
    * [E.ON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.ON)
    * [Uniper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniper)
    * [Engie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engie)
* **Energy retailers**: Companies that sell electricity to consumers:
    * [Octopus Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_Energy)
    * [OVO Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovo_Energy)
    * [E wie Einfach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_wie_einfach)
    * [Yello Strom](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yello_Strom)
    * [Tibber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibber)

### Housing

* Construction companies and building contractors

Renting apartments and houses:
* [Vonovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vonovia)

### Communication

If you have internet access, you don't need to send SMS or make traditional phone calls,
as services like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram cover these needs. Therefore, we can focus on
internet connectivity.

    * [Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.)

## Safety Needs

Safety needs are primarily covered by public institutions like police, military, health insurance,
and unemployment insurance.

In the private sector, insurance companies provide additional coverage such as supplemental health
insurance (e.g., travel insurance, dental insurance) and property insurance.

Companies in this sector include:
