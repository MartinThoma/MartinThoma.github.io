The [Alpspitze](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpspitze) (not to confuse with [Alpspitz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpspitz)) is a mountain in the alps
with one of the simplest [via ferratas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata).
It was my first one, too.

I documented what you need for it so that you can easily hike / climb the
same route.

I planned the route as a 2-day route. One day to get to the starting point,
the second day to take the route.


## Equipment

I'll put the German word in brackets, as I'm not totally sure about the best
translation.

- Climbing helmet (Steinschlaghelm): The more expensive ones are more lightweight. Everything with EN&thinsp;12492 should be good. 30 - 80&thinsp;Euro ("Edelrid Zodiac" was 55&thinsp;Euro and weights 359&thinsp;g)
- Sit harness (Klettergurt): The more expensive ones are more
  lightweight / more comfortable. ("Ocun: Twist Basic XS - M" was 55&thinsp;Euro)
- Ferrata set ("Elliot: Forril Tech Klettersteigset mit Bandfalldämpfer" was 65&thinsp;Euro)
- Carabiner ("Mammut: HMS Bionic Twistlock Plus basalt" was 19&thinsp;Euro)
- Webbing loop ("Elliot Bandschlinge 60cm" was 3&thinsp;Euro)
- Travel Sheet (Hüttenschlafsack)
- Headlamp ("Moorhead Stirnlampe", about 15&thinsp;Euro)
- Cycling gloves
- Map

I like the following cloths for hiking. They are comfortable in a wide range of
temperatures and they don't stink that much / feel bad  when you sweat:

- VAUDE Herren Hose Farley Stretch Pants II (ASIN B01HL94DU0)
- Icebreaker Herren T-Shirt Tech Lite Short Sleeve (ASIN B00L6EHH4Q)
- Odlo Herren Pullover Midlayer 1/2 Zip Sun Peaks (ASIN B00DG1BOK0)
- FALKE Herren Trekking Socken TK2 Short Coool (ASIN B001E11Y1I)
- Icebreaker Herren Unterhose Anatomica (ASIN B016D9ZS9Y)

Don't forget that it will be much colder up there than on the ground.

Other things you need / might want to take with you:

- Food (e.g. an apple, sausages and several cereal bars)
- At least 1&thinsp;L of water (can be refilled at the house)
- Toothbrush and toothpaste
- Money (25&nbsp;Euro for sleeping at Kreuzeckhaus, 60&nbsp;Euro for food and miscallenious stuff, 32&thinsp;Euro for the cable car)
- Medicine and hygiene stuff (For example, I always want to have tissues and dental floss with me)
- Camera
- Smartphone and loading cable / power bank
