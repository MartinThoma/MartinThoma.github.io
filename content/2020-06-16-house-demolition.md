I'm interested in house building for quite a while now. I want to live in my
own house at some point and there are many options to get there. One of them
is to buy an old house in a nice location, tear it down and build a new one.
But how expensive is that and how does it work?

## How it works

### Preparation

* Remove furniture, make all rooms empty (especially cellar / attic)
* Remove doors
* Remove insulation
* Remove everything made out of wood

## Cost

According to [^1], is about 10&thinsp;000&nbsp;EUR to 25&thinsp;000&nbsp;EUR:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Price</th>
        <th>Position</th>
        <th>Comment</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1000</td>
        <td>Planning</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2000</td>
        <td>Preparation</td>
        <td>Remove interiour and possibly pollutants like&nbsp;Asbestos. If pollutants are present, it becomes more expensive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10,000</td>
        <td>Demolition</td>
        <td>Assuming it is easy to access and it can be demolitioned. More expensive if it needs to be deconstructed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4,000</td>
        <td>Cellar</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3,000</td>
        <td>Waste dumping</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
