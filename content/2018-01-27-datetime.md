Specifying a point in time is a pretty common task. And it is extraordinary
difficult. Lets have a look at the different ways to specify a point in time.

<div>If you want to learn more about time, read my summary <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1443533">What every developer should know about time</a>.</div>

Imagine the following scenario: We record some events, e.g. actions of a credit
card user. In case of potential fraud, an automatic system locks the card and a
human has a look at the actions and times. The human monitoring system requests
all data related to this credit card user. Of course, most if it has time
stamps. As it is another system, the time has to be transfered from the
recording system to the monitoring system. And it might well be that one does
not want to give direct database access but rather a REST-like API endpoint.
Thus the way to serialize the datetime has to be a string.

Now... how do you encode a datetime to a string?


## Unix Time

The Unix Time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, minus the number
of leap seconds that have taken place since then.


Problems:

* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> Not human-readable
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> [Year 2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) for 32-bit systems.
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> Everything before the 1st of January in 1970 is not representable

Especially the last point is a killer criterium against Unix time in many
applications.


## Calendar systems

Most countries use the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar)
today,<sup>[<a href="#ref-1" name="ref-1-anchor">1</a>]</sup> so the type of
calendar is at least something we don't have to worry about. But then the problems begin.
I thought [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) would be a simple,
human-readable, unabiguous format that looks like this:

```text
2018-01-27T16:45:01+00:00
2018-01-27T16:45:01+00:00
1990-12-31T23:59:59+00:00
```

But due to leap seconds / days and due to changes in timezones I'm pretty sure
there is one point in time which has two different ISO 8601 time stamps. Please
let me know in the comments if you see one (best if it can be shown with some
programming languages).

So the TL;DR about ISO 8601:

* <span style="color: green;">&#8853;</span> Lexicographical ordering is also
  the ordering by time.
* <span style="color: green;">&#8853;</span> It is human readable
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> ISO 8601 does not only have
  `2018-01-27T16:45:01+00:00` but also `2018-01-27T16:45:01Z` and
  `20180127T164501Z` were Z means Zero offset for UTC. So there are multiple
  representations for the same point in time.
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> Anything before
  `0000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00` is not representable.<sup>[<a href="#ref-2" name="ref-2-anchor">2</a>]</sup>
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero">Year zero doesn't exist</a>


## Falsehood Programmer beliefies

* Months have either 30 or 31 days.
    * False! You forgot February.
* Years have 365 days.
    * False! You forgot February again! There are [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year).
* A given geographic point (e.g. a city) has always the same time zone.
    * False! You forgot [DST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time).


## Python

Let's check that with Python:

```python-repl
import datetime


>>> datetime.datetime(0, 11, 1).isoformat()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: year is out of range

>>> datetime.datetime(1, 11, 1).isoformat()
'0001-11-01T00:00:00'

>>> datetime.datetime(9999, 11, 1).isoformat()
'9999-11-01T00:00:00'

>>> datetime.datetime(99999, 11, 1).isoformat()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: year is out of range

>>> datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24).isoformat()
'2017-12-24T00:00:00'

>>> datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()
'2017-12-24T00:00:00+00:00'

    >>> a = datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24)
    >>> b = datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 24, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
    >>> a - b
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

## Parsing stuff
>>> datetime.datetime.strptime('0020-11-01T00:00:00', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
datetime.datetime(20, 11, 1, 0, 0)

```

By now, [Datetime parsing with Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/datetime-parsing+python) is usually done like this:

```python
from dateutil import parser as dateparser

date_obj = dateparser.parse("Tue May 08 15:14:45 +0800 2012")
```

Things that are unintuitive for me:

* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> Why don't all datetime objects have
  timezone information? (See [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48478879/562769))
* <span style="color: red;">&#8861;</span> Python can create a format it can't consume again.

## JavaScript

```js
var d = new Date();
console.log(d.toJSON());
```

gives `2018-01-27T22:51:17.691Z`. So it is a ISO 8601 datetime with miliseconds
and zero offset. Nice!

You can also find this in the [ECMA specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15):

> ECMAScript defines a string interchange format for date-times based upon a
> simplification of the ISO 8601 Extended Format. The format is as follows:
>
> YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ


## PHP5

```shell
$ php -a
Interactive mode enabled

php > $dt = new DateTime();
php > echo $dt->format(DateTime::ATOM);
2018-01-27T23:58:12+01:00
```

You can see that PHP gives you the ISO 8601 string with the zone offset, but
not the milliseconds.


## Footnotes

* [<a href="#ref-1-anchor" name="ref-1">1</a>] I've heard the [Islamic calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar) is used in Saudi Arabia.
* [<a href="#ref-2-anchor" name="ref-2">2</a>] Or only by mutual agreement... which is the same as breaking the standard, if you ask me.
