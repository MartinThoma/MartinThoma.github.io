Access control is the act of restricting access to a selected group of people or systems. That group is authorized to access the system. To check if a person is authorized to access, the person typically has to be authenticated.

In this article, I focus on web services. Access to physical systems like your notebook / full disk encryption is a different story. And access to buildings/tailgating is yet another story.

In the context of access control, one typically speaks of those entities:

* **Subjects**: People like my girlfriend/Obama/my neighbor; organizations like
  the NSA; companies like Github/Google/Facebook; software like bots
* **Objects**: Partitions, files, databases, database schemas, database tables, ‚Ä¶
* **Rights**: Read, write, modify/alter, delete, add/insert, append, enter, execute, ‚Ä¶

For example, my girlfriend has permission to enter my house. In this case, my
girlfriend is the subject, the object is ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and the right is ‚Äúenter‚Äù.

In this article, you will get to know how access control can be broken,
different types of access control, and finally some tricks for effective access
control. Let‚Äôs start!

## How can access control be broken?

Many things can go wrong in access control and some of them are very hard to
automatically check. This is the reason why broken access Control (BAC) is
[number 4 in OWASP TOP-10
2017](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control).

### Hiding a system isn‚Äôt secure

The (implicit) assumption that some systems or data don‚Äôt need access control,
because they are never (purposely) exposed to the public is a common mistake.
I‚Äôm thinking here of AWS S3 buckets where people let just everybody upload. The
thought here is that people need to know the name of the bucket and no one
would just try `s3://company-data` or similar.

Another attack that goes in this direction is called **insecure direct object
reference (IDOR)**. Imagine you wanted to download an invoice from Amazon and
found that it downloaded it fromhttps://amazon.com/invoice/1234/invoice.pdf .
Wouldn‚Äôt you be curious about what
[https://amazon.com/invoice/1233/invoice.pdf](https://amazon.com/invoice/1234/invoice.pdf)
contained? It could very well be that this would be an invoice of a different
person. And it could be that there is no more access control performed.

### Forgetting to apply access control

Many backend systems have dozens of routes. All of them need to apply access
control. It depends on the implementation of your access control system, but it
could be that you need to add code to every route which is not public. This
makes it easy to forget. And to miss it in a code review that it was forgotten.
Even if all people agree that the route needs access control.

### Client-side access control

I haven‚Äôt seen client-side access control in a long time, but please don‚Äôt forget: Access control needs to be done server-side. I have never seen effective client-side access control for web systems.

### Trusting the client

Authentication typically means that the user needs to enter a username/email
and a password. Then the server creates either a session or a token to remember
that user. We don‚Äôt want the user to have to authenticate again and again.

Typically, there are at least 3 levels of users:

* Anonymous users
* Registered users
* Admins

The admins are also registered but have more privileges than all other users.
The system needs a way to distinguish the admin from normal users.

Sometimes, this is done with an unsigned cookie. Hence we store the information
if the user is an admin at the client. Non-malicious users will not tamper with
that information and thus the browser tells us with every request ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an
admin‚Äù. But malicious users can change that cookie. By changing the is_admin
cookie from `is_admin=false` to `is_admin=true` they perform a **privilege
escalation**.

There are two typical ways around it:

* Cryptographically sign this information and check the signature with every request
* Store that information on the server and look it up when you receive the
  cryptographically signed user id.

Storing the information on the client has the advantage that you might be able
to save some requests to the database.

Storing the information on the server has the advantage that a loss in
privileges will instantly be effective.

### Missing Expiration Date

Imagine this: Your company has a system for employees. Most employees can only
see their payslip, but team leads can also see the payslip of their team. Team
leads also can give rewards to well-performing employees. You are a team lead.
You use that system daily and you never log-out. At some point, you get a
promotion. You are no longer a team lead, though. Hence you should no longer be
able to see your former team's payslips. But you do.

If the system stores the authorization and the role in a token that never
expires on the client, the client could use that token forever. As some of your
systems might rely on that token being correct, they never check another
source. The cryptographic signature is right and thus the token is trustworthy.
And it was. Until the contained information changed.

### Broken Authentication Control

If you can authenticate as another user, you will get all rights of that user.
It‚Äôs not really broken access control but has the same effect. I‚Äôll write a
couple of articles about authentication:

* [Password Hashing](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/password-hashing-eb3b97684636) üòá
* Multi-factor authentication ‚Äî yet to be written!
* Single-sign on ‚Äî it‚Äôs on my list, buddy ü§û
* OAuth and OpenID ‚Äî you guessed it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs on the way üòÖ

## Access Control Policies

The following access control policies deal with slightly different problems.
I‚Äôm not talking about specific technologies here, but the abstract concepts
which many implementations use.

### **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**

You can formally store all rights as tuples (Subject, Object, Right). You can
store those tuples either as a matrix or as a list of tuples. Or you can do it
object-centric and store a list of all subjects with their rights. For example,
for the file foobar.txt you could store `Alice:read,write; Bob:read`. This is
called an **Access Control List (ACL)**. You can also store that information
subject-centric: For each user, store what the user can do. That is called a
**Capability List (C-List)**. It‚Äôs still the same information, but another data
structure.

The ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù part is that the users are allowed to change the
permissions of an object.

### **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

In the case of DAC, the rights did not have any relation to each other. This is
different in MAC. For MAC, the rights are ordered: `Public < confidential <
secret <top secret`. Users have a clearance and objects have a classification.
If Bob has a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù clearance, he is allowed to read documents that are
classified as ‚Äúsecret‚Äù, ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù, or ‚Äúpublic‚Äù. MAC is used by SELinux and
AppArmor.

In contrast to DAC, in the MAC case users are not allowed to change the
permissions. The permissions are set by the system administrator.

### **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**

Assigning permissions to subjects directly might be a lot of administrative
work. Instead, you can create a role, e.g. ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, ‚Äúquality assurance‚Äù,
‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù, ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù, ‚ÄúCTO‚Äù. Every subject can have an arbitrary amount of
roles. Roles have rights for objects. For example, for the ‚Äúothers salary‚Äù the
role ‚ÄúCTO‚Äù might have the right to ‚Äúread‚Äù and ‚Äúedit‚Äù it. For a given object,
the rights of a subject are the set of all rights of all roles that the user
has. RBAC is used by all content management systems (CMS) I know. Famous
examples are Wikipedia, Reddit, and StackExchange.

To apply RBAC, you need a role table (could also be called group ) and a table
that connects users with groups:

![Image by author](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*XT6bjGvqQR9DNciLRlUXFA.png)*Image by author*

Then you need to get all roles a user has:

```sql
SELECT role_id FROM role_user WHERE user_id = :current_user
```

You might want to cache this query as you will execute it a lot and the roles
might not change that quickly.

The last ingredient is to store an access control list per route. In Flask, it
could look like this with [Flask-User](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-User/):

```python
@app.route("/analytics", methods=["GET"])
@roles_required("admin")
def analytics_route():
    return {"some": "analytics_data"}
```

When this route is called, the `@roles_required` decorator first executes the
access control code. If the user doesn‚Äôt have access, the rest is ignored and
an exception is thrown or an error response is returned.

RBAC can be combined with either DAC or MAC. For web applications, it‚Äôs typical
that the objects (the routes) have some fixed roles they require. Only the
developers can change them. They are fixed in the code, not in a database. The
decorator `@roles_required("admin")` here is an ACL.

### **Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)**

One part that is missing for RBAC is context. You want to use the relationship
between the subject and the object, e.g. if the subject is the creator of that
object it might automatically grant the subject some rights. Or depending on
the time or location, the rights might change. For example, normal employees
might not be allowed to access the office between 11 pm and 5 am.

We don‚Äôt want to fire too many requests against our database, give meaningful
error responses, and not repeat code. A good compromise could be this pattern:

```python
@app.route("/article/<article_id>", methods=["PATCH"])  # execute (1)
@get_article  # execute (2)
@attribute_required(is_author)  # execute (3)
def edit_article(article: Article):  # execute (4)
    ...  # update the article
```

The get_article decorator simply uses the ORM:

```python
from typing import Any, Callable
from functools import wraps


def get_article(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """
    Make the variable "article" available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable
        Needs to have an 'article' keyword parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    modified_func : Callable
        A function where the parameter 'article' is added to
        the signature
    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(**kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        article_id = kwargs["article_id"]
        article = get_article_from_db(article_id)
        kwargs["article"] = article
        return func(**kwargs)

    return wrapper
```

The is_author function then is pretty straight forward:

```python
def is_author(article: Article, user: User) -> bool:
    return article.author_id == user.id
```

More complicated is the design of attribute_required , but in principle, it works similarly to the decorator above.

### Why RBAC/ABAC with Decorators is great

Let‚Äôs say you build the e-commerce website eBay. One entity is an auction. It has various attributes:

* **Auction ID**: Set by the system, immutable
* **Seller ID**: Set by the system, immutable
* **Title**: Set by the user, immutable
* **Description text**: Set by seller, editable by seller

You could implement the change_descripion_text function like this:

```python
def change_descripion_text(id):
    auction = Auction.query.filter_by(Auction.id == id).first()
    if current_user.id != auction.seller_id:
        raise PermissionDeniedException("Only the seller may edit")
```

Then you realize that admins should always be able to change it:

```python
def change_descripion_text(id):
    auction = Auction.query.filter_by(Auction.id == id).first()
    is_seller = current_user.id == auction.seller_id
    is_admin = is_admin(current_user)
    if not (is_seller or is_admin):
        raise PermissionDeniedException("Only the seller may edit")
```

And you might realize that you also should check for moderators. And maybe you
allow companies to sell as well. So not only the person who put it in the shop
but also moderators of that company should be able to adjust description texts.
And then you realize that there is metadata such as weight/volume of the item
as well. The mentioned access control just has too many places in which the
developers can get things wrong.

Instead, you can use roles. For example, seller sounds like a role. The roles
can be context-dependent.

```python
@requires_role([SellerRole(id), AdminRole(), ModeratorRole()])
def change_descripion_text(id):
    auction = Auction.query.filter_by(Auction.id == id).first()
```

## Tricks to make Access Control Effective

The case of creating web services is certainly most interesting to most
readers, so let‚Äôs focus on that. Access control is enforced in the backend and
hence typically on the API level. It‚Äôs most of the time about which users can
call which API endpoints, but sometimes it can be more complicated. For
example, in a social network, every user might be allowed to get the list of
friends of another user. But you might only see the birthday if you are a
friend of that user yourself. Hence some endpoints might be callable but
deliver different data depending on the caller.

For now, let‚Äôs just focus on the simple case with a REST API. If you have the
permission to call an endpoint with a given set of parameters, then you will
always get the same result. No matter who you are / which role you have. The
only right we care about for now is ‚Äúcan call‚Äù. Our subjects are ‚Äúusers‚Äù and
our objects are the combination (route, parameter).

In such a scenario, you will typically want to make a role-based system. There are some simple principles that can help:

* **Deny by default**: It‚Äôs easy to add a new route somewhere. Make sure that
  people don‚Äôt leak data by not allowing any access whatsoever by default. Make
  them write down which roles are allowed.
* **DRY**: Don‚Äôt repeat yourself. Implement the access control code once and
  make it simple to check without copy-pasting the implementation. In Python /
  Flask, you typically want a decorator over your function to denote the
  allowed roles.
* **Least privilege**: Don‚Äôt give people roles they don‚Äôt need. Don‚Äôt give
  roles permissions they don‚Äôt need. Remove roles from people if they leave ‚Äî
  no matter if they leave the job or just that role. The fewer people have
  access, the less potential for issues.
* **YAGNI**: Designing good software is hard. Some software engineers tend to
  think 10 steps ahead and build the system for potential future use cases. Of
  course, sometimes you already know that topics are on the table. Otherwise,
  **y**ou **a**in‚Äôt **g**onna **n**eed **i**t (YAGNI). Build stuff when you
  need it. That might mean a bit more work and refactoring parts of the
  software. That‚Äôs ok.
* **Minimize attack surface**: Whenever you can, try to remove features and
  outdated code. Code you delete doesn‚Äôt need to get maintained. It cannot have
  security issues.
* **Clustering objects around Rights**: If you have a few types of
  rights/roles, you could group your objects around that. For example, if your
  objects are files, your roles are ‚Äúowner‚Äù, ‚Äúgroup‚Äù, ‚Äúother‚Äù and the rights
  are ‚Äúread‚Äù / ‚Äúwrite‚Äù / ‚Äúexecute‚Äù, then this grouping is a directory with
  Unix-style permissions. If you‚Äôre thinking about web services, your objects
  could be routes, the rights would be ‚Äúcall‚Äù and the roles would be
  ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù, ‚Äúregistered‚Äù, ‚Äúadmin‚Äù. Then you can organize your code in such a
  way that no file contains routes for anonymous users AND admin users. If you
  do that, then human errors become way easier to exclude. In a review, if
  suddenly an admin-type route appears in a ‚Äúnormal user‚Äù file, this is easy to
  spot.
