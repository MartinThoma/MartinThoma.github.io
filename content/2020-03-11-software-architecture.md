My mentee recently asked me what software architecture is. How do you draw
an architecture diagram? What is a bad one and how do I learn to draw good ones?

The software architecture gives a very high-level overview of a software system.


## Typical Components

A software architecture tries to solve a problem. It tries to achieve
"high quality" in some of the properities mentioned in [ISO/IEC 25010](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010).

One very typical property is **modularity**. We want to have components which
are to a large degree independent so that different teams can work on it. It
also helps with Analysability, Modifiability and Testability.

        <td>The front-ends typically can be seperated pretty well in different teams. They need to access the same backend services.</td>

        <td>Caches are important to make things fast and reduce load. There are many different ways to cache.</td>

        <td>If you built your service in a way to be horizontally scalable, load balancing is crucial. Round-robin or hashing on the IP address are possible choices.</td>

## Interfaces

When reading that there are different Front Ends, you might wonder how you
define the interfaces between front ends and backend services.

* [REST API](https://martin-thoma.com/rest/): [OpenAPI Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) e.g. with [Flask-RestX](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
* [Avro](https://aseigneurin.github.io/2018/08/02/kafka-tutorial-4-avro-and-schema-registry.html)
* Flat file: Sometimes it is enough to make a file available, e.g. via FTP or even HTTP (Amazon S3). The strenght of a single file is batch-load. You can keep the files and thus track the past. It is not a good choice for streaming / real time applications where you have a lot of events.


## Typical Patterns

* Layers: Presentation layer, application layer, business logic layer, data access layer
* Client / Server: Online applications
* Master / Slave: In database replication
* Broker pattern: Distributed Systems
* Peer-to-peer pattern: File sharing
* Event-bus: Android development
* Model-view-controller: Django applications and many more web applications
