[Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) is a compiled
programming language which aims to replace C++. The designers wanted it to be
similar fast, give the programmer similar fine-grained control over memory
management, but more safety.

Rust does so by introducing the concept of
[*ownership*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html),
[*borrowing*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html) and
[*lifetimes*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/lifetimes.html) of variables. Rust
also makes sure that after the scope is finished, the memory of variables gets
de-allocated.

I think <abbr title="Foreign Function Interface">FFI</abbr> is interesting. It
allows Rust to "talk" with C code.

Rust 1.0 was just released ([source](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html)).
This means the language should be stable.

If you want to know more, you should take a look at the beautiful
[A 30-minute Introduction to Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/intro.html).


## Syntax Example

```rust
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let n = 36;
    println!("The {0}th Fibonacci number is {1}.", n, fib(n))
}
```

## Comparison

* [benchmarksgame](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp) shows that rust is similar fast as C++. For some games
  it is faster, for some slower. Sometimes it needs less code, sometimes more.
* [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust?sort=votes&pageSize=50)
  has only 1781 questions of which are 102 unanswered (5.7%). C++ has 356,824
  questions and 55,172 questions are not answered (15.5%). But I guess that
  will change as soon as more people use Rust (and libraries written in Rust).
* [GitHub](http://githut.info/#Rust): Wow, Rust seems to be growing fast!


## Tools

As rust is still in very heavy development, you should build it yourself from
the [source at GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). Don't worry, there
are very detailed instructions. (But it takes *a lot* of time to compile.)


* [`cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) package manager
* Syntax Highlighting and auto completion for ST3 ([via Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Rust))
  * Auto completion with [Racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer)

## Comparison to C++

> 1: No crashes because of code misuse (as long as you do not use unsafe {} )
>
> 2: No memory leaks
>
> 3: No data races (so you can thread this thing like mad, but better is has async task handling (crs pattern to). So lighting up your machines cores is no prob.
>
> 4: Cross platform (really much better than most)
>
> 5: Inbuilt version management, build system and test harness (with benchmarking to).
>
> 6: Package management system (no more I Cannot build XX, it becomes automatic)
>
> 7: Inbuilt generics and traits (c++ concepts and more)
>
> 8: Very strongly typed (near zero runtime)
>
> 9: Very fast
>
> 10 compiles into a c lib basically (easy integration)

## Conclusion

Rust looks very, very interesting. I am usually not a fan of new languages
(e.g. I don't see a reason to use [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)), [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) ...
not to speak of [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)), [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript), [Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language))).
Most of the time, I don't see anything new which is better than in existing
languages and almost always the material around (tools, libraries, community)
is much worse than in existing solutions.

This seems to be different with Rust. Rust seems to provide everything I enjoy
from Python, but in the fast, explicitly typed world.

@[Johannes](http://schickling.me/): Thanks for pointing me to Rust ☺
