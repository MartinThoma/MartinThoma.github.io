It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2019

Not a lot happened about which I want to write publicly, so here are some other
mentionable facts:

* I have 68&thinsp;643&nbsp;points (+28&thinsp;060) on StackOverflow and reached 29.9&nbsp;million people (+7.5&nbsp;million)
  with my posts ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/martin-thoma)).
* I wrote only 50&nbsp;articles for this blog (including this one, not counting 15 ones which were pulished as a cleanup) in 2019. A couple
  of them might be interesting:
      * [Simple Operations and Basic Numbers](https://martin-thoma.com/simple-operations/) gives an idea how fast different operations are
      * [Bucketing in A/B Testing](https://martin-thoma.com/bucketing-in-ab-testing/)
      * [Flask Chat with Polling](https://martin-thoma.com/flask-chat-1/)
      * I published a paper and a dataset: [WiLI-2018](https://martin-thoma.com/wili/)
      * A couple of reviews, e.g. [Monitors](https://martin-thoma.com/monitors/), [hiking insoles](https://martin-thoma.com/insoles/), [water bottles](https://martin-thoma.com/water-bottles/), [Fitness Trackers](https://martin-thoma.com/fitness-trackers/) and [Password Managers](https://martin-thoma.com/password-managers/). I also [switched my health insurance to TK](https://martin-thoma.com/krankenkasse/)
      * Political ones, e.g. about [Climate Change](https://martin-thoma.com/climate-change/) and [HomÃ¶opathie](https://martin-thoma.com/homoeopathie/)
      * 10 recepies, including [vegetable curry](https://martin-thoma.com/vegetable-curry/), [crispy thuna and tofu](https://martin-thoma.com/crispy-thuna/) and [Shrimps and Tofu](https://martin-thoma.com/shrimps-and-tofu/)
* I've uploaded 31&nbsp;files to Wikipedia Commons in 2019 (2195 files in total, <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/ptools/uploadsum.php?user=MartinThoma">source</a>). My uploads to Wikipedia Commons
  are about 6&thinsp;GiB in total now. On commons, I made 5418&nbsp;edits in total.

Interesting changes in my life: Hmm ... actually, I'm not sure ðŸ¤” Maybe that I
survived my Nepal trip ðŸ˜… (seriously, I got pretty sick during that trip / after
it and that was a lot of my vaccation this year). Again, I thought often about
moving out of my shared flat. I'm pretty sensitive to noise and it's simply
too crowded here. Let's see.

Again I can say that I spent a lot of time with working. Maybe too much time.
I've noticed that I contributed a lot less to Wikipedia and wrote less blog
articles of lower quality. I did write more answers on StackOverflow again.


### Old year resolutions

* <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Get comfortable with Orange Bouldering routes (5c-6c) and finish at least 5 harder ones (6c - 7b): I am comfortable at 5a and manage to do 6a+ ones. No chance at 7b... not even close.
* <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Create a GAN for my [HASYv2 dataset](https://arxiv.org/a/thoma_m_1.html): I didn't even attempt this ðŸ˜¢
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> Create at least 10 more blog posts with recipes: [1](https://martin-thoma.com/pho/), [2](https://martin-thoma.com/siomay-ayam/), [3](https://martin-thoma.com/vegetable-curry/), [4](https://martin-thoma.com/sandwich/), [5](https://martin-thoma.com/lasagne/), [6](https://martin-thoma.com/shrimps-and-tofu/), [7](https://martin-thoma.com/apple-pancakes/), [8](https://martin-thoma.com/semmelknoedel/), [9](https://martin-thoma.com/carrot-soup), [10](https://martin-thoma.com/cantuccini/)
* <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Create at least 10 high-quality Media files for Wikipedia: [1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Trigonomatric-functions.svg),
      [2](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2d-chi-squared-pdf.svg),

### Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> Tensorflow will keep being the
   dominant deep learning framework as measured by (1) StackOverflow questions,
   (2) Google Trend, (3) Github repositories
2. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> There will still not be a DOTA playing AI which can replace a human DOTA
   player in a human team with the usual flexibility: The best thing we can do is [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/) which does not coorporate with humans but play together against amateur humans.
3. <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> We will see fraud cases related to ML: Although I expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfakes</a> to be used for that, I haven't seen any news.

To show the deep learning stuff:

## Predictions for 2020

Machine Learning and Technology

1. Still Lithium-Ion will not have any contender for Smartphones
2. Python 2 will still be around (despite <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">pythonclock.org</a>, <a href="http://chhantyal.net/py3readiness/">py3readiness</a>, <a href="https://python3statement.org/">python3statement</a>)
3. Still no real, unrestricted self-driving cars which ordinary people can buy
   (e.g. less than 300k USD and on open market) on the road (despite [this](https://emerj.com/ai-adoption-timelines/self-driving-car-timeline-themselves-top-11-automakers/) and many more claims)


About Me

4. I will write at least 10&nbsp;articles around sustainability / reducing waste /
   climate change
5. I will run 6.1&nbsp;km (Distance of B2Run) in less than 30 minutes
6. I will reduce my weight from 69&nbsp;kg currently to 64&nbsp;kg
7. I will live 350&nbsp;days meat-free (sea food is ok)


The bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World

8. [ ] Germany will still produce more than 400 Mt CO2 and thus fail the climate targets (2017 it was 906&nbsp;Mt, [source](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/klima/treibhausgas-emissionen-in-deutschland#textpart-4))
9. [ ] At least 3 wildfires which will burn more than 100,000 ha
10. [ ] The impeachment of Trump will not bring him into prison
11. [ ] Trump will be the republican candidate
12. [ ] Sanders will be the democrats candidate
13. [ ] Democrats will win the election
