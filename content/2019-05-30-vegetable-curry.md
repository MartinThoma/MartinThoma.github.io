[Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry) is a dish found in many asian
countries. It's always spicy, but necessarily in the hot-spicy sense. There are
just a lot of spices in Curry ðŸ™‚.

* 1 [pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum)
* 2 carrots
* 3 [spring onions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_fistulosum)
* 0.5 tea spoons salt
* 0.5 tea spoons pepper
* 0.5 tea spoon of powder for vegetable broth (German: GemÃ¼sebrÃ¼he)
* 2 tea spoons sugar
* 2 [table spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablespoon) Curry

* **Side dish**: Rice; roughly 0.1L per person. I like Jasmin rice most.


## Tools

* A big [Wok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok) in which all of the above fit
* A sharp knife and a [cutting board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_board) for cutting the vegetables
* A rice cooker - if you don't have that, a pot is also fine
* A [Ladle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladle_(spoon)) to get the Curry out of the wok
* One spoon and a soup plate per person


## Preparation

For all of the following, you will need roughly 1h.

1. Peel the carrots and cut them into sticks.
2. Wash the Broccoli and cut it into pieces that you can eat comfortably,
3. Cut the onion.
4. Wash the spring oninons and cut them into pieces
5. Was the Zucchini. Cut the Zucchini in roughly 1cm thick slickes. Make
   roughly 4 - 9 pieces out of the Zucchini, so that you can eat it
   comfortably.
