Before the computer ...
... a memory was something you've lost with age
... an application was for employment
... a program was a TV show
... a cursor used profanity
... a keyboard was a piano
... a web was a spiders home
... a virus was the flue
... a CD was a bank account
... a hard drive was a long trip on the road
... a mouse pad was where a mouse lived
... a tree, leaf and root could be found in nature
... a path was wa way
and if you had a 3,5 inch floppy...
... you hoped nobody found out.

If you like this kind of humor, you might want to watch this video:
