Ikeas Pax system is a modular wardrobe system. I bought:

* 901.839.91: [PAX Korpus Kleiderschrank](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/80214568/#/90183991): 236cm x 50cm x 58cm (H x W x D)
* 902.568.93: [Komplement Kleiderstange](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/30256891/#/90256893)
* 502.463.06: [Komplement Schublade](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/70246348/#/50246306)
* 702.779.81: [Komplement Boden](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/10277984/#/70277981)

It was nice to combine with MALM:

* 203.598.23: [Schreibtisch, Eichenfurnier weiß lasiert](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/60214159/#/20359823)
* 091.750.57: [Bettgestell hoch](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/S99022550/#/S09175057)
* 702.787.06: [Lönset Federholzrahmen](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/90278343/#/70278706)

## What I like

* All manuals are online as PDF. You just need to remember the article numbers
* You can combine things to what you need.


## What I miss

* If you choose to have doors, there are 18cm until the first drawer can
  beginn. There seem not to be any Ikea boxes of the necessary size.
* You can choose to make the front at the bottom of the Korpus either relative
  directly at the front or about 1cm more to the inner. I now have two Korpus
  where I choose one depth on one side and the other depth on the other side.
  Sometimes less choice is better.


## Assembling

I missed one hint when assembling the cabinet: Use many nails for the back of
it! When you use too few, things can fall behind.
