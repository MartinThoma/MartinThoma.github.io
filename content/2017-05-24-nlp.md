Natural language processing (NLP) is a scientific field which deals with
language in textual form.

Tasks in NLP are:

* **Classification**: Is an e-mail spam or not? Is it about sports, science or religion?
* [**Named Entity Recognition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition): Parse a text
  into names of places, people, organizations and non-names.
* **Translation**: Given a text in language A, return the same content in language B.
* **Text generation**: Generate text in a given style.
* **Similarity calculation**: Given a corpus of n texts and one text A as
  input, find passages of the corpus which are similar to passages of A. This
  can be used to detect if students copied content / copyright violation.
* **Spelling correction**: Find places where the grammar / writing needs to be
  fixed.
* **Sentiment analysis**: Find out how users feel about something.

Data sources are:

* Twitter
* Wikipedia
* News websites
* Amazon Reviews


Typical libraries are:

* [**NLTK**](http://www.nltk.org/): The natural language toolkit. Written in Python, for Python. ([Book](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html))
* [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/): According to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/69xbkc/question_spacy_or_nltk/), it is cleaner than NLTK but less complete.
* [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/): A simple to start
  toolkit for Python.
* CoreNLP: Faster than NLTK (source?), written in Java, Python wrappers available
* [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/): topic modeling and document similarity analysis
* [fasttext](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText): a classifier on top of a sentence2vec model
* DeepText: an NLP engine

Well-known products are

* [aspell](https://github.com/GNUAspell/aspell)
* [Google n-gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams)
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
* Quora: [Duplication detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs)


## Terminology

* n-gram model: Model language by counting word-tuples of length n.
* word2vec: Embedd any word in a (high-dimensional) vector space. Allows vector arithmetic.
* sentence2vec: Similar to word2vec.
* Stemming: Bring a word in a normed form (the stem). Mostly for verbs.
* POS Tagging
* Information extraction
