Software development is a huge industry. Naturally, there are many
specializations which makes it difficult for outsiders and freshmen to
understand this topic.

A work process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>
distinguishes three roles:

* Development Team: Writing Code
* Product Owner: Voice of the customer; prioritizes features
* Scrum Master: Helps to remove impediments; supports

In practice, companies never hire only "a developer". At the very least they
focus on some of the core languages important for the company (often Java,
JavaScript, PHP, C++, or Python). And most of the time they distinguish between
some technical roles.


## Technical Roles

All technical roles are software engineers with some form of specialization.
I looked at the first 30 results of <a href="https://de.indeed.com/Devops-Engineer-Jobs">indeed.com</a>
to see what the current expectations are for those roles (2019-07-14).

What almost every technical role has:

* Fluent in English, German is a plus (sometimes required)
* Team Player
* Agile Development (most of the time Scrum)

### Quality Assurance (QA)

### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

## Soft Roles

### Product Owner (PO)

This is a role defined in Scrum. The tasks of a product owner (PO) are:

* Management of product backlog:
    * Items in the backlog have to have a priority-order
    * Every team member has to understand the items of the backlog.
* Responsible for the product
* Talks with Stakeholders / Management
* Checks if items of the backlog directly related to the product can be moved
  from "In Review" to "Done".


### Scrum Master (SM)

Requirements for a scrum master

What the scrum master is:

* **Supporter**: Supports the team by removing obstacles. This can be as simple
  as making sure the team has a place to work, the equipment and permissions to
  work.
* **Talker**: Moderates scrum meetings, makes sure information between PO and
  the team flows.
* **Protector**: Protects the team from interference during the sprint

What the scrum master isn't:

* Team lead: The scrum master does not tell which work to do or in which way it
  should be done
* Team member: The scrum master is not actively developing
* PO

Tools:

* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Burndown Chart


### Project Manager
