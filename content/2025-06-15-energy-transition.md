The world is transitioning to electric energy.

Humanity started with **organic energy sources** like wood and animal power,
then transitioned to **fossil energy sources** like coal, oil, and gas. Now,
we're moving toward **renewable energy sources** like solar, wind, and
hydroelectric power.

This shift is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The transition to electric energy involves not just changing our energy sources but also transforming how we use energy.

## Nuclear Energy

There are two types of nuclear energy: **fission** and **fusion**. Fission is
the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei to release energy, while fusion is
the process of combining light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus,
releasing energy in the process.

As of 2024, the world relies solely on fission for nuclear energy. We haven't
yet figured out how to make fusion economically viable, and it remains a topic
of research and development. It's unclear when - or if - fusion will become a
practical energy source.

Fission has several advantages, such as being a low-carbon energy source with
high energy density. However, it also has significant drawbacks, including the
production of radioactive waste, the risk of nuclear accidents, and the
potential for nuclear proliferation. An often overlooked aspect is that
nuclear power plants require large amounts of water for cooling, which can be a
limiting factor in their location and operation, especially in arid regions.
France, for example, has had to reduce nuclear power generation during heat waves
due to water shortages for cooling.

Nuclear power plants operate in 31 countries and generated about a tenth of the
world's electricity in 2023.

There are a few countries with a significant share of nuclear energy in their
electricity mix:

* [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France): [64% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/france/electricity), but it seems to drop since 2015. Most notably are [long outages due to heat waves](https://efe.com/en/economia/2023-08-17/france-to-reduce-nuclear-power-generation-due-to-heat-wave/) in 2023.
* Slovakia: [29% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/slovak-republic/energy-mix)
* [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Switzerland): [28% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/switzerland/energy-mix)
* Bulgaria: [25% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/bulgaria/energy-mix)
* [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Ukraine): [24% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/ukraine/energy-mix). They are building new reactors to replace the ones damaged during the war.
* Hungary: [18% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/hungary/energy-mix)
* [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Belgium): [18% in
  2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/belgium/energy-mix). They planned a
  nuclear phase-out until 2035, but reversed course in 2025.
* [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_South_Korea): [17% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/korea/energy-mix)
* [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Spain): [13% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/spain/energy-mix). They plan to [phase out nuclear power by 2035](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spain-confirms-nuclear-power-phase-out-extends-renewable-projects-deadlines-2023-12-27/)
* [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_the_United_States): [10% in 2023](https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/energy-mix).

Worldwide, there are approximately 70 reactors under construction and about 100
additional reactors planned
([source](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)):

* Only 15 countries are building new reactors: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil,
  China, Egypt, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea,
  Turkey, UK, and Ukraine.
* Worldwide, there are proposals for 294091 MWe of new nuclear capacity:
    * 184450 MWe in China (63%)
    * 30800 MWe in India (10%)
    * 10000 MWe in Poland (3%)

In the context of our need to transition away from fossil fuels due to climate
change, nuclear energy faces two main challenges:

1. **Building new reactors takes a long time**: It can take 10-20 years to build
   a new nuclear power plant, which is too slow to meet the urgent need for
   low-carbon energy sources.
2. **Water usage**: Nuclear power plants require large amounts of water for cooling,
   which can be a limiting factor in their location and operation, especially in
   arid regions. This can lead to conflicts over water resources and may not be
   sustainable in the long term.

Due to these challenges, nuclear energy is not a viable solution for Germany's energy transition.

## Renewable Energy

We need to ensure that the electric energy we use comes from renewable sources.
We can do this by using **solar panels**, **wind turbines**, and **hydroelectric
power**. These energy sources are abundant and sustainable. As an added benefit,
they also make us less dependent on other countries for energy. This was - and
remains - a significant issue in the current conflict with Russia, as Germany
heavily relied on Russian gas.

Besides solar panels and wind turbines, we need **batteries** to store the
electricity generated by those renewable sources. Batteries allow us to use
electricity when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. They shift
the energy production to when it's needed.

[Edwards & Sanborn](https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-blog/top-5-largest-bess-projects-in-the-world-in-2025)
by Terra-Gen is the biggest **battery energy storage system (BESS)** in the
world, with a capacity of **3.3 GWh** and an output of 0.8 GW. It is located in
California and was completed in 2024. The biggest BESS in Kern County,
California, US.

In comparison, in 2024, Germany’s total electricity consumption (grid load) was
approximately 462 TWh. So about 1265 GWh/day.

However, batteries can only shift energy production by a few hours or days.
We need to combine them with other energy sources to ensure a stable energy
supply. To address this challenge, we have the following options:

* [**Pumped hydro storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity):
  This is the most common form of large-scale energy storage. It uses excess electricity to
  pump water uphill to a reservoir. When electricity is needed, the water is
  released to generate hydroelectric power.
  The [Bath County Pumped Storage
  Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_County_Pumped_Storage_Station) has
  a capacity of **24 GWh** and an output of 3 GW, making it the world's largest
  pumped hydro storage facility with an overall efficiency of about
  79%.
* [**Compressed air energy storage (CAES)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed-air_energy_storage): This technology uses excess
  electricity to compress air in underground storage chambers. When electricity
  is needed, the compressed air is released to drive turbines and generate
  electricity. The largest CAES plant is in Yingcheng, China, with a capacity of
  **1.5 GWh**, an output of 300 MW, and an efficiency of 70%. The main challenge
  for CAES is that it requires significant space (typically salt mines) and
  infrastructure to store the compressed air.
* **Hydrogen gas turbines**: Excess electricity can be used to produce hydrogen
  through electrolysis. The hydrogen can then be stored and later used to
  generate electricity in fuel cells or burned in gas turbines. This is a
  promising technology, but it remains expensive and is not yet widely deployed.
* **Electric grids**: We have extensive electric grids that connect
  different regions and countries. These allow us to share electricity and
  balance supply and demand across large areas. They also enable us to import
  electricity from regions with excess renewable energy and export it to regions
  with high demand.

## Energy Storage

Germany will need Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to store the electricity
generated by renewable sources:

## Electrification

In order to avoid using fossil fuels, we need to **electrify** many aspects of
our lives:

* **Transportation**: We need to switch from internal combustion engines (ICE,
  using gasoline and diesel) to battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
  This includes cars, buses, trucks, and trains.
    * **Scooters**: The Honda PCX 125 has a range of 350km, a top speed of
      100km/h, and refueling takes about 5 minutes. The NIU MQi GT EVO also has
      a top speed of 100km/h, but only a range of 75km and requires 5 hours to
      charge.
    * **Cars**: The case is fairly clear here. The main barrier to EV adoption
      is the purchase price. The range and charging infrastructure are already
      sufficient for most people.
    * **Buses**: Many cities are already converting some of their buses to
      electric. The main challenges are range and charging infrastructure,
      especially in rural areas during winter.
    * **Trucks**: While electric trucks are available, they are not yet widely
      adopted. The reasons for slow adoption are not entirely clear.
    * **Trains**: If overhead lines are present, trains can be electrified
      relatively easily. Without them, electrification is much more challenging
      and expensive to implement.
* **Heating**: People need to insulate their homes and switch from gas or oil
  heating to heat pumps. Infrared heating is only viable for very well-insulated homes.

### Challenges

* **Lithium supply**: The demand for lithium is expected to increase
  significantly due to the growth of the electric vehicle market and the need
  for energy storage systems. This could lead to lithium shortages, which could
  drive up prices and make battery production more difficult:

* **Electricity demand**: The transition to electric energy will increase
  electricity demand, potentially straining the existing grid and leading to
  blackouts. We need to invest in grid infrastructure and energy storage systems
  to ensure a stable electricity supply.
* **Charging infrastructure**: We need to build robust charging
  infrastructure for electric vehicles to ensure that people can charge their
  vehicles when and where needed. This includes fast-charging stations on
  highways and charging stations in urban areas.
