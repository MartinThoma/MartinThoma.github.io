Failing to register the correct domain or failing to renew a domain is a massive
security issue.

I'm writing this as one company I use just has this. I've just bought their
domain and redirect here.

If I was an attacker, I could get the usernames and passwords of all people who
login over that domain ... potentially forever, if I make a redirect.

If you belong to that mobile carrier: Please contact me (info@martin-thoma.de)
to discuss further steps.

## Historic Cases

See [How I Ended Up Purchasing & Owning Google.com via Google Domains](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-purchased-domain-googlecom-via-google-domains-sanmay-ved/?trk=prof-post) by Sanmay Ved. And that was a lucky case back in 2016.
