When I go hiking in Europe, I usually take simple plastic one-way bottles form
the supermarket. They are cheap, I can have two so that the weight is balanced
left and right, I can have 2×0.5L, 2×0.75L, 2×1.0L, or 2×1.5L. When I think
they are dirty, I just return them in a store and buy new ones.

Going to Nepal, there are a few important differences:

1. I might want to fill boiling water in a bottle and have it in my sleeping
   bag for the cold night.
2. Nepal deals by far not as good with waste as Germany does.

Hence I want a bottle with the following characteristics:

* *Temperature Resistance*: Boiling water does not damage the bottle
* *Watertight*: I don't want to have a wet sleeping bag.


## Material

* Glass: It's just too heavy. And it can break too easily
* Plastic: Super lightweight, durable. Might have problems with boiling water.
* Metal: You can use it to boil water inside! But keep in mind that you might
  need to touch it.

## Features

* Material
* Size of opening: The wider, the easier it might be to fill. But the easier
  you spill.
* Insulation
