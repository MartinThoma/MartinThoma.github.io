Data Science recently became popular. Currently are 154 open job positions on
Indeed.com for Data Scientists in Munich. To put it into context: There are 186
Android developer positions open, 527 Dev Ops, 753 frontend, 812 backend. So
it's still fairly small, but in the same ballpark.

## Typical projects

### Classification and Regression

* Detect if a e-mail is spam or not

### Forecasting

* How many users will be on the website?
