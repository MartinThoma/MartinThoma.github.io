An animator faces his own animation in deadly combat. The battlefield? The Flash interface itself.

A stick figure is created by an animator with the intent to torture. The stick figure drawn by the animator will be using everything he can find—the brush tool, the eraser tool—to get back at his tormentor. It's resourcefulness versus power. Who will win? You can find out yourself.
