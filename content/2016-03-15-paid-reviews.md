I am often asked if I would like to review a book. So here is my answer to
all of those requests:

**I don't work for free. If you want high quality work, you have to pay for it.**


## About me

I finished my Computer Science bachelors degree at KIT / CMU and I'm currently
in my masters degree at KIT (Karlsruhe, Germany). My mother tongue is German,
but my English is not too bad. I'm specialized in Machine Learning.

I'm working with the typesetting system LaTeX for quite a while now
([source](https://github.com/MartinThoma/LaTeX-examples/)).

See [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/a/thoma_m_1.html) for some of my work.


## Topics

When it comes to bachelors thesis, I think I can review probably any topic.
This is likely not to be the case when I review a masters thesis.


## Getting in Touch

Just send me an E-Mail (`info@martin-thoma.de`). Make sure to include what you
want to be reviewed. Key information I want is:

* Language of the work (English or German)
* Type of work (e.g. book, bachelors thesis, masters thesis, paper)
* Title of the work (e.g. "A review of Semantic Segmentation")
* A short description what it is about.
* What should I focus on?
    * Spelling, Typos, Grammar
    * Expressions
    * Typesetting
    * Logic, structure and consistency
    * Factual correctness

If you want me to review it, you should either send me a PDF or give it to me
in printed form directly. I will make annotations in a printed version and give
you that. You have to pay in advance (I can give you a receipt if you want).


## Prices

The following prices are rules of thumb. If you want to know what you have to
pay, you have to get in touch with me. This is only meant to give you some
idea of what it might cost. Especially checking factual correctness thoroughly
might cost much more.

I make book reviews for 50&nbsp;Euro&nbsp;/&nbsp;hour or
2.50&nbsp;Euro&nbsp;/&nbsp;page (as you like).

If you want me to review your bachelors or masters thesis, I'll do
so for 30&nbsp;Euro&nbsp;/&nbsp;hour or 1.50&nbsp;Euro&nbsp;/&nbsp;page.


## Hints

The higher the quality of your work is, the more you will get for your money
from my review. So check your stuff first. Ideas what might be wrong give the
following tools

* Text-Based:
    * [Academic-Writing-Check](https://github.com/devd/Academic-Writing-Check)
    * `aspell`
* LaTeX
    * Searching for "Warning" in the LaTeX log
    * Search for "?" in the PDF to find missing references
    * Try the package `nag` (see [How to use nag](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/117751/5645))


## My Copy-Paste answer for dubious E-Mails

```text
Dear Sir or Madam,

Yes, I am interested in writing a review for your work.

This makes either 50 Euro/hour or 2.50 Euro/page. What would you prefer?
How would you like to pay?

You might want to answer some key questions about your work.

Best regards,
Martin Thoma

One shady business I found so far is `packtpub.com`. They contacted me more
than once and wanted me to work for free.
