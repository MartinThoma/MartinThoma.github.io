Once in a while I think it is time to reduce the damage being done by the loss
of a USB stick.

## Remove all data

Find the USB stick on your Linux system with `fdisk -l`. Make super sure that
you really got the stick (e.g. by removing it and executing the command again).
It should be something like `/dev/sdb1`.

The following command will overwrite the data on the stick 5&nbsp;times:

```bash
$ shred -f -n 5 /dev/sdX
```

This may take several minutes even for very small USB sticks.


## Format the stick

Start `gparted` and use the GUI.

## Add README

In case I lose the stick, adding a README.txt makes with a way to contact me
makes it most likely that I get the stick back.
