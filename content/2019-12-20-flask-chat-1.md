Chat applications are everywhere nowadays. The two best-known ones are probably
Slack and WhatsApp. If you keep the amount of users low (e.g. less than 100)
and the number of features limited, then it is actually pretty easy to create
such a chat app.

I've create a small proof of concept chat app with Flask and jQuery. It runs in
the browser.


## Architecture

We will keep it simple for this tutorial:

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter img-thumbnail">
    <a href="../images/2019/12/chat-flask.png"><img src="../images/2019/12/chat-flask.png" alt="Chat App" style="width: 512px;"/></a>
    <figcaption class="text-center">Chat App</figcaption>
</figure>

We store the messages - and only that - in a single table in a SQLite database.
We have an API which has one endpoint <code>messages</code> which allows to
<code>GET</code> messages (filtered by id) and to <code>POST</code> a new
message.

The backend is done with Flask.

The front end is partially done with <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/">Jinja2</a> and partially with jQuery.


## Project Structure

The folder structure is typical for Flask applications:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── docs
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── routes.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── static
│   └── templates
├── Dockerfile
├── migrations
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── start.sh
└── wsgi.py
```

In the root directory, you have a <code>start.sh</code> which uses the
<code>wsgi.py</code> to start a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunicorn">gunicorn</a>
server. The <code>pyproject.toml</code> gives some basic configuration.

Within the <code>app</code> directory, there is a single <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/blueprints/">blueprint</a> called "main". The <code>models.py</code>
defines the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/models/">sqlalchemy database models</a>, the <code>api.py</code> defines the REST API with <a href="https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">flask restplus</a>.

The front end is in the templates directory.


## How it works

When a new user opens the website, they get a session variable with a unique
identifier. They receive all messages which were ever written (yes, in a
productive system this is an awful idea) and they store the latest message ID
they have seen.

Locally, jQuery asks every 500ms for new messages. For this request, it gives
the latest message it has seen. This means most of the time the server returns
an empty response.

When the client sends a new message, it is stored in the database.

That's it.


## User Experience

### General Theme

The key CSS classes you have are:

* `message`: It can either be one you received or one you sent.
* `conversation`: The block that contains the stream of messages.

See [this codepen](https://codepen.io/swaibu/pen/QxJjwN) for a nice the theme
by Rumbiiha Swaibu.

### New Messages

A key point that took me a bit to implement is to add the most recent messages
at the bottom and keep scrolling with the most recent ones - but only if you
didn't scroll up before.


## Why this is awful

Missing core functionality:

* Registration and Authentication: It is important who writes something. So
  people want to know the sender. In the system above, it is super easy to
  change the ID to somebody elses ID. To have arbitrary many IDs. It is hard to
  know who writes something. This topic comes with a lot of other topics like
  single sign on (SSO), 2FA / MFA, password recovery...
* Formatting: Allow users to format messages (bold, italic, links, math mode, ...)
* Chatrooms: People want to have private conversations. Conversations splitted
  by topic.
* Search: Once you have different rooms, you might want to search across rooms.
* Images
* File sharing

Other missing functionality:

* [Voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) (calls) and [Videotelephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony) (Video chat)
* Themes: Let users change the default looks
* Tennants: Besides chats / chatrooms, you might want to run the chat
  appliction as a service for organizations. They have their own (seperate)
  users and chat rooms. Maybe have some possibilities for customization.

Engineering:

* Scalability: If the database comes to its limits, you have to get a bigger
  machine. Other databases like AWS DynamoDB might have better behaviour.
* Backups were not even mentioned
* Polling: Pining the server twice per second is no big deal if you have few
  users. But the more users you get, the worse this will become.
* Pagination: Getting all messages in the beginning is a really bad idea.
* Front Ends: You might want way more. For example, native apps for smartphones.
* Protocols: Adding support for [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) to
  allow usage of other clients
  ([IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) seems to be
  outdated; [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)) could be an alternative according to [this German post](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/messenger-matrix-das-xmpp-fuer-hobby-admins/))
