Today a friend of mine <a href="http://www.rene-pickhardt.de/first-youtube-dvd-online-for-ballads-n-bullets-by-in-legend/">posted</a> an article about a very neat idea. He created a DVD-like menu with several YouTube clips.

Just take a look:

This idea is beautiful: It is simple, but it didn't come to my mind before. I knew overlays and saw them sometimes, but I never saw them being used in such a nice way.

Great work, Ren&eacute;!
