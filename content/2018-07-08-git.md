[`git`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a (the!) version control system.
In this article I'll try to show in a short way how to improve your usage of
it.

I assume you already know [`git clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone),
[`git commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit),
[`git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push),
[`git pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) and
[`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch).


## Why Version Control

When you write software, you usually can't write it from beginning to end in
one stream. Instead, you will have different directions in which you go. And
you will work one day on feature A, then on next day you have to fix something
but you already changed a bit - not everything to implement A. Hence you need
to go back.

Or you are not sure if the thing you're trying to do actually improves things.
So you want to save the current state to be able to go back.

In the past, people did so by copy-and-paste. But then you end in your file
system having directories like `awesome-project`, `awesome-project-copy`,
`awesome-project-1990-04-28`, `awesome-project-feature-a`, ...

So you want to be able to manage that properly and jump back and compare
different versions.


## Change steps

* *Working directory*: `git add` to add it to staging
* Staging: `git commit` to move it to the local repository
* Local repository: `git push` to move it to a remote repository, `git fetch` to get it from remote.
* Remote repository


## What it's not for

In general, I would not use git for things where you can't reasonably make a
diff. This includes:

* Binary files: Ipython notebooks, compiled code
* Big files (> 5 MB): Data.
* Auto-generated files.

Of course, there are exceptions. Just keep it practical.


## Commit Messages

Commit messages are intended for developers to understand what was changed.

I like the [SciPy commit message guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/dev/gitwash/development_workflow.html#writing-the-commit-message).
They start every message with a prefix. Copied from this page, here is how their
messages look like:

```text
ENH: add functionality X to numpy.<submodule>.

The first line of the commit message starts with a capitalized acronym
(options listed below) indicating what type of commit this is.  Then a blank
line, then more text if needed.  Lines shouldn't be longer than 72
characters.  If the commit is related to a ticket, indicate that with
"See #3456", "See ticket 3456", "Closes #3456" or similar.
```


The prefixes I suggest to have, are:

```text
API: an (incompatible) API change
BUG: bug fix
DEP: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
DEV: development tool or utility
DOC: documentation
ENH: enhancement
MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
REV: revert an earlier commit
STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
TST: addition or modification of tests
REL: related to releasing the project, e.g. change of a version number
```

I also suggest to keep those messages shorter than 80 characters.

Services like GitHub can directly connect commits with issues if you reference
the issues like `issue #123` in the commit message.

## git log

[`git log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) shows you the commit messages and
other logged changes:

## git diff

[`git diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) compares two commits, e.g.

```shell
$ git diff e44ed1e8e5bdcada8534369c5135e77677253de1..8cf8c8d4b168ef3b0a32617917195a352f4ce723
```


Looking up the git hashes (`e44ed1...` and `8cf8c8d...`) is cumbersome, so
there are shortcuts. For example `HEAD` is the latest version. And `^` gives
you the version before. Hence

```shell
$ git diff HEAD^..HEAD
```

compares the current version with that before.



## git blame

[`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) gives you an overview who
last edited which line. It can be used to "blame" somebody for a change. Or,
better, to find the person who to ask why something was done the way it
currently is in the repository.

For the a part of the `filters.py` in SciPy ndimages it looks like this:

## git squash

The git commit history should be kept clean. If you develop a new feature you
might want to push the latest state - even if something is not working - from
time to time to the server so that your co-workers can have a look at it. But in
the `master` branch it would be nice if every single commit was a single new
feature.

[Commit squashing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51049029/562769) allows you to
change multiple commits into a single one. This needs to re-write the version
history which cannot be undone. Thus you need to force-push which will cause
problems for everybody who had the version you were changing.

So as a general guide:

* Never force-push on master
* Avoid force-push on branches where multiple people work
* Squash commits, if you are the only one working on it and if it makes it
  easier to understand what you did.

Similar, but simpler is `git commit --amend`. It lets you add something to the
latest commit in the current branch and edit the commit message.


## Merging

When you are currently in a merge, git will tell you form time to time that
something cannot be auto-merged. Then you can execute [`git mergetool`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool)
which will start whichever tool you configured. In my case, it is [`meld`](http://meldmerge.org).
See my [Software Versioning Cheat Sheet](https://martin-thoma.com/software-versioning-cheat-sheet/#nice-diffs_1).


## Tagging

Git gives your versions a hash. This is ok most of the time, but sometimes you
actually want to note that your software has a specific version. You can use
[`git tag -a v1.4`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) (see [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging))
for that.

Github marks those tags as releases. See my [mpu releases](https://github.com/MartinThoma/mpu/releases),
for example.

You can also show diffs / logs with the tags, e.g.:

```shell
$ git diff v0.2.0..v0.3.0
```


## Git Hooks

[Software Hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking) are a plugin-technique.
Hooks allow users to alter and extend the software. In git, there are many
different hooks. They follow the naming schema `[pre/post]-[event]` hook. Here
are some with possible use-cases.

* `pre-commit`:
    * Check the commit message for spelling errors
    * Apply a linter to check for coding standards
    * Execute (fast) tests to ensure correctnes
* `pre-receive`:
    * Enforce project coding standards.
    * Enforce working tests
* `post-commit`:
    * Notify team members of a new commit (e.g. via e-mail or slack)
* `post-receive`:
    * Push the code to production
