pre-commit hooks are a mechanism of the version control system git. They let
you execute code right before the commit. Confusingly, there is also a Python
package called pre-commit which allows you to create and use pre-commit hooks
with a way simpler interface. The Python package has a plugin-system to create
git pre-commit hooks automatically. Itâ€™s not only for Python projects but for
any project.

After reading this article, you will know my favorite plugins for professional
software development. Letâ€™s get started!

## pre-commit basics

Install pre-commit via

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Create a .pre-commit-config.yaml file within your project. This file contains the pre-commit hooks you want to run every time before you commit. It looks like this:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: mixed-line-ending

-   repo: [https://github.com/psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black)
    rev: 20.8b1
    hooks:
    -   id: black
```

pre-commit will look in those two repositories with the specified git tags for a file called .pre-commit-hooks.yaml. Within that file can be arbitrary many hooks defined. They all need an id so that you can choose which ones you want to use. The above git-commit config would use 3 hooks.

Finally, you need to run pre-commit install to tell pre-commit to always run for this repository.

Before I used it, I was worried about losing control. I want to know exactly which changes I commit. pre-commit will abort the commit if it changes anything. So you can still have a look at the code and check if the changes are reasonable. You can also choose not to run pre-commit by

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## File formatting

Formatting files in a similar way helps readability by improving consistency
and keeps git commits clean. For example, you usually donâ€™t want trailing
spaces. You want the text files to end with exactly one newline character so
that some of the Linux command-line tools behave well. You want consistent
newline characters between Linux (`\n`), Mac (`\r` â€” [Mac
changed](https://superuser.com/questions/439440/did-mac-os-lion-switch-to-using-line-feeds-lf-n-for-line-breaks-instead-of)
to `\n` ðŸŽ‰) and windows (`\r\n`). My configuration for that is

```yaml
# pre-commit run --all-files
repos:
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-byte-order-marker  # Forbid UTF-8 byte-order markers
    # Check for files with names that would conflict on a case-insensitive
    # filesystem like MacOS HFS+ or Windows FAT.
    -   id: check-case-conflict
    -   id: check-json
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: mixed-line-ending
```

## Code style

We can write code in a lot of different ways. Many of them show almost no
difference in runtime, but there are differences in readability.

### Code Autoformatter

</figure>

Automatic code formatting has the same advantages as the file formatting.
Additionally, it prevents meaningless discussions. Thus it lets you and your
team focus on the important and complicated parts.

I love Pythons autoformatter black and mentioned it already in the article about [static code analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/static-code-analysis-for-python-bdce10b8d287):

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black)
    rev: 20.8b1
    hooks:
    -   id: black
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs](https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs)
    rev: v1.8.0
    hooks:
    -   id: blacken-docs
        additional_dependencies: [black==20.8b1]
```

The first one is black itself, the second one is a project which applies the
black formatting to code-strings within docstrings.

Additionally, I want my imports to be sorted:

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config](https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config)
    rev: v2.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: seed-isort-config
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort)
    rev: v5.4.2
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
```

There are autoformatters with pre-commit hooks for many languages:

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html#option-3-pre-commithttpsgithubcompre-commitpre-commit): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GraphQL, and many more.
* [Clang-format](https://github.com/andrewseidl/githook-clang-format): C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Protobuf, C#
* [Rustfmt](https://github.com/doublify/pre-commit-rust): Rust


### Modern Python

[pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) runs over your Python code and automatically changes old-style syntax to new-style syntax. Just have a look at some examples:

```python
dict([(a, b) for a, b in y])  # -> {a: b for a, b in y}


class C(object):  # -> class C:
    pass


from mock import patch  # -> from unittest.mock import patch
```

Do you want it? Here you are:

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade)
    rev: v2.7.2
    hooks:
    -   id: pyupgrade
        args: [--py36-plus]
```

## Testing your Code

I thought about running the unit tests automatically by pre-commit. I decided not to do that as this might take quite a while. However, there are some quick tests which are good to run automatically and every time:

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-ast  # Is it valid Python?
    # Check for debugger imports and py37+ breakpoint() calls
    # in python source.
    -   id: debug-statements

-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy)
    rev: v0.782
    hooks:
    -   id: mypy
        args: [--ignore-missing-imports]

-   repo: [https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8)
    rev: '3.8.3'
    hooks:
    -   id: flake8
```

## Security

Checking in credentials is a pretty common mistake. Here is how you prevent it:

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: detect-aws-credentials
    -   id: detect-private-key
```

## Miscellaneous pre-commit hooks

Some hooks donâ€™t fit in the above categories but are still useful. For example, this one prevents big files from being committed:

```yaml
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-added-large-files
```

## Working in a Team

The pre-commit hooks are installed locally and thus every developer could
decide on their own if they want pre-commit hooks and which ones. However, I
think it is helpful to provide a .pre-commit-config.yaml with plugins you
recommend to execute.

## All the hooks!

If youâ€™re looking for a complete .pre-commit-config.yaml ready to use, here it is:

```yaml
# Apply to all files without commiting:
#   pre-commit run --all-files
# Update this file:
#   pre-commit autoupdate
repos:
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-ast
    -   id: check-byte-order-marker
    -   id: check-case-conflict
    -   id: check-docstring-first
    -   id: check-executables-have-shebangs
    -   id: check-json
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: debug-statements
    -   id: detect-aws-credentials
    -   id: detect-private-key
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: mixed-line-ending
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy)
    rev: v0.782
    hooks:
    -   id: mypy
        args: [--ignore-missing-imports]
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config](https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config)
    rev: v2.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: seed-isort-config
-   repo: [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort)
    rev: v5.4.2
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
-   repo: [https://github.com/psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black)
    rev: 20.8b1
    hooks:
    -   id: black
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade)
    rev: v2.7.2
    hooks:
    -   id: pyupgrade
        args: [--py36-plus]
-   repo: [https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs](https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs)
    rev: v1.8.0
    hooks:
    -   id: blacken-docs
        additional_dependencies: [black==20.8b1]
```

## Summary

I love pre-commit as it fits so well in my workflow. I just commit as usual and
pre-commit does all the checks which I sometimes forget. It speeds up
development because the CI/CD pipeline is just way slower than executing the
same steps locally. Especially for linting, itâ€™s an enormous time-saver to
quickly run black over the code instead of committing, waiting for the CI/CD
pipeline, finding an error, fixing that error locally, pushing, and waiting
again for the CI/CD pipeline.

Please let me know as a comment or email (info@martin-thoma.de) if there are
other pre-commit hooks you like!
