Today is Halloween and this is a perfect time to talk about undead Python stuff
ðŸ§Ÿ - Packages, Versions, practices. Everything.


## Versions

A while ago I wrote about [current Python versions](https://martin-thoma.com/current-python-versions/)
in which I basically say that you should use Python 3.6 or later. We are currently
at TODO. And still people ask Python 2.7 questions and write Python 2.7 code.

TODO: Show version distribution.


## Packages

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>old</th>
        <th>New</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PIL</td>
        <td>Pillow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Theano</td>
        <td>Tensorflow / PyTorch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lasagne</td>
        <td>Keras</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>nose</td>
        <td>pytest</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Practices
