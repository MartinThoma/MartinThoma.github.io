This Review gives an overview of intersting stuff I stumbled over which are
related to machine learning.


## New Developments

* [Tensorflow 1.0 is released](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-tensorflow-10.html)


### Human-strenght and Super-human strength programs

Super-human strength programs are programs, which surpass even the best human
(on the long run) in a specified task. Human-strength programs behave similar
to an (untrained) human.

Although those are not new, seeing them as a list ([source](http://blog.evjang.com/2017/01/nips2016.html))
was new to me. However, except for the games and lip reading, I doubt that we
are there yet. Interesting, non the less:

* Games
    * 1995, Checkers: [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_(draughts_player))
    * 1996, Chess: [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
    * 2016, Go: [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)
* Lip reading: 2016, [Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05358) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aogzAUPilE))
* Speech transcription: 2016, [Achieving Human Parity in Conversational Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05256)
* Translation: 2016, [Zero-Shot Translation with Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html)
* Driving: 2016, [Waymo](https://waymo.com/)

## Live Demos and Websites


* [universe.openai.com](https://universe.openai.com/): Related to the OpenAI gym.
* [Project Malmo](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/03/13/project-malmo-using-minecraft-build-intelligent-technology/): Train RL agents in Minecraft
* [VISIIR](http://visiir.lip6.fr/): VIsual Seek for Interactive Image Retrieval - classifying food
* [Image-to-Image](http://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/index.html)




## Publications

<!-- e.g. arXiv -->

* [High-Resolution Image Inpainting using Multi-Scale Neural Patch Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09969) and [Code](https://github.com/leehomyc/High-Res-Neural-Inpainting)
* [The Game Imitation: Deep Supervised Convolutional Networks for Quick Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05663.pdf) and [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvesq6LEQxg&list=PLegUCwsQzmnUpPwVv8ygMa19zNnDgJ6OC&index=1)
* [Deep Nets Don't Learn Via Memorization](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJv6ZgHYg)

## Software

<!-- e.g. Theano, Keras, ... -->

## Interesting Questions

<!-- For example StackExchange -->

* [Why is the accuracy of my CNN not reproducible?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42326466/why-is-the-accuracy-of-my-cnn-not-reproducible)


## Miscallenious

### Trump QA idea

I was just watching [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSx-N9ayCvU&feature=youtu.be&t=3m40s) and wodered how well a question answering system would work which is trained on Trump speaches. Very often, when reporters / journalists / moderators ask Trump a question, he answers with "I am the [most / best / least] [positive / negative statement]. [Inconsistent answer follows]".
The answers themself would almost certainly be hilarous. Second, one could make an experiment and ask people if Trump actually answered a question like this.
