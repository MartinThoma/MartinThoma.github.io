It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2016

This year was pretty awesome. I went to a summer school in Greifswald where
I got to know a lot of nice people. I participated in a wind surfing and in
a sailing course. I hiked the [GR 20](https://martin-thoma.com/gr-20/),
finished my first via ferrata ([Alpspitz-Ferrata](https://martin-thoma.com/alpspitze-via-ferrata/)),
went to the [Salewa-Klettersteig](http://www.klettersteig.de/klettersteig/salewa_klettersteig_iseler_oberjoch/1645) and
the [Tegelberg&nbsp;Klettersteig](http://www.klettersteig.de/klettersteig/tegelberg_klettersteig/1795) near Füssen.

In July, I got to know [Bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) and managed to finish the first Fb 6c - 7b routes. However, only routes up to 5c are always
easy for me (see [table with climbing grades](http://www.klettern.de/besser-klettern/schwierigkeitsgrade/vergleichstabelle-schwierigkeitsgrade-beim-klettern.159298.5.htm) and [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing))).

In December, I've got the chance to go to [NIPS 2016](https://martin-thoma.com/nips-2016/)

Here are some other mentionable facts:

* [ML-KA](https://ml-ka.de/) is still active.
* I have 15&thinsp;838 points on StackOverflow and reached 5.1&nbsp;million people
  with my posts ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/martin-thoma)).
* I wrote 53&nbsp;articles for this blog (including this one) in 2016. A couple
  of them might be interesting for a very specific audience ([SVMs](https://martin-thoma.com/svm-with-sklearn/), [classifier comparison](https://martin-thoma.com/comparing-classifiers/),
  [machine learning glossary](https://martin-thoma.com/ml-glossary/)).
* I've uploaded 835&nbsp;files to Wikipedia Commons in 2016 (<a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/ptools/uploadsum.php?user=MartinThoma">source</a>). My uploads to Wikipedia Commons
  are about 3&thinsp;GiB in total now. On commons, I made 4414&nbsp;edits in total.


### Old year resolutions

* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 05.02.2016: Sold my old vacuum cleaner
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 17.02.2016: Quit church
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 08.05.2016: Migrate Blog to Pelican
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 14.04.2016: Contact BSI, BKA, CCC and the car sellers and send them
  [my paper](https://zenodo.org/record/50379) in which I summarize current
  problems in car security. (Later, I found [this](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article154677618/BSI-Chef-warnt-vor-Toten-durch-Hackerangriffe-auf-Autos.html). Coincidence?)
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 01.11.2016: I got rid of my old bed.
* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 03.11.2016: I painted some walls in my appartment (not all, though).

I failed to get all my stuff from my father to my place. However, most of it
is here now. Also, I didn't find new slippers.



### Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. *Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8&nbsp;layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30&nbsp;layers.*<br/>
   [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) has networks with over 1000 layers. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span>
2. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear.<br/>
   [Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist), [/r/howhot](https://www.reddit.com/r/howhot) <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span>
3. Machines will generate "high" resolution images of at least 256 &times; 256
   pixels.<br/>
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03242">StackGANs</a> generate 256&thinsp;px &times; 256&thinsp;px images <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span>
4. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the
   original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in
   Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy. See [Towel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day), [Google Translate Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-google.ogg), [Festival Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-festival.ogg) <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span>
5. ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to
   about 900&nbsp;Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690&nbsp;Euro).<br/>
   <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> It only went up to 760&nbsp;Euro.
6. [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/) will make some tiny
   advances.<br/>
   <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span> Very, very, tiny updates.

About Me

7. One of my papers will get cited at least 5&nbsp;times. <span style="color:red;">&#x2717;</span>
8. I will spend at least 2&nbsp;weeks abroad.<br/>
   <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Done</span>: My trip to Corsica was a bit longer than 2&nbsp;weeks. Then 10&thinsp;days in Barcelona.
9. I will publish at leat 40&nbsp;articles on my blog.<br/>
   <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Done</span>: 53&thinsp;articles.
10. I will get a 90&nbsp;days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is
   43&nbsp;days).<br/>
   <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Failed</span>
11. I will get 15&thinsp;000 points on StackExchange (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/martin-thoma?tab=accounts))<span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span>

Politics

12. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
    still exist and Britain will still be part of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).<br/>
    <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Correct</span> (Yes, they voted for Brexit. But currently they are still part of the EU. And I doubt they will really quit the EU.)
13. Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the
    democrat candidate.<br/>
    I was right about this.
14. The republican candidate will get president. <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Correct</span>
15. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will
    happen. <span style="color:#37a32f;font-weight:bold">Correct</span>
16. Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see [Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtagswahl_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_2016)).<br/>
    <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">False</span>: Grüne and CDU.

## Finishing things

I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially
cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash.

## Predictions for 2017
