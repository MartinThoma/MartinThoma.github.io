In the last few months I've seen a couple of astonishing and frightening
stories about the US. I'm not sure how much of a problem those stories really
are.


## Police, Agencies and Justice

### Faking Terrorism

> On Thursday, roughly 67% of prosecutions involving suspected ISIS supporters include evidence from undercover operations, according to The New York Times.
>
> In many cases, agents will seek out people who have somehow demonstrated radical views, and then coax them into plotting an act of terrorism â€” often providing weapons and money. Before the suspects can carry out their plans, though, they're arrested.

### Police legally robbing people

It is called "Civil Forfeiture":

## Democracy

In the US there seem to be several measures in place solely to make people not
being able to vote. And if they can vote, then they can't get what they want
with their vote. Namely:

* [John Oliver: Voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHFOwlMCdto) - voter
  registration votes which were designed to make minorities vote less
* An overly complicated, unintuitive voting process ([John Oliver: Primaries and Caucuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S2G8jhhUHg)),
* [John Oliver: Washington DC Statehood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z4j2CrJRn4)
* [John Oliver: Puerto Rico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-mpuR_QHQ)
* [Felony disenfranchisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement):
  Making people not being allowed to vote - this seems to be a problem in Germany, too.
* [Voter suppression in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States)
* [John Oliver: Gerrymandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4dIImaodQ)
* Excluding larger groups of the population by
    * Having the day of vote not on Sunday (e.g. Super Tuesday)
    * Voter ID laws
    * Having extremely long queues in some areas (having to wait several HOURS! - I'm used to be finished in about 10 minutes)
* Tactical voting: People don't vote for the candidate they like best, but for
  the one they think has the highest chance to win. This would be fixed by
  ranked-choice voting.
