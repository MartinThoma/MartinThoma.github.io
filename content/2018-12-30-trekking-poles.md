<div class="info">This is an article I had for quite a while as a draft. As part of my yearly cleanup, I've published it without finishing it. It might not be finished or have other problems.</div>
I've always hiked without poles, but for Nepal my guide recommends to take
poles.

In the past, I mainly would have liked them for river crossings (e.g. GR-20).
I finally decided not to take trekking poles. I did not regret that decision.

## Features

* Handles: You hold the trekking poles several hours a day, for several days in
  a row. They better feel good. Kork seems to be a popular choice.
* Weight
* Material: [Super bad review for carbon fiber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0SfswKYOTE) / Aluminium
* Type: Z-Type, FlickLock
* Snow Baskets

## Brands

First brand name I've heard was Black Diamond. Within Bittel Sport (local sport shop),
I found a lot of Leki.
