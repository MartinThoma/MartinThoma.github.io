A typical German soup.


## Ingredients

For two people:

* 0.5 kg carrots (peeled and cut into slices)
* 1 big [potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato)
* 100ml [whipped cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipped_cream) (German: Schlagsahne oder Süße Sahne)
* 2 small onions
* 2 garlic cloves
* 0.5 L vegetable broth
* Oil
* Pepper
* Salt
* Garlic powder

Side dish:

* Fresh bread (e.g. Baguette or Chiabatta)


## Tools

* A big pot for the soup (with cover / lid)
* Hand mixer to blending the cooked carrots / potatos
* Cooking Spoon


## Preparation

1. Cut the onions and the garlic cloves into small pieces.
2. Cut the carrots and potatoes into slices which are later easy to blend.
3. Put oil in the pot and heat it.
4. Put the onions and the garlic into the pot. Fry it for roughly a minute.
5. Put the carrot and potato pieces in the pot. Add salt, pepper, garlic
   powder. Wait for roughly two minutes. Stir it once in a while.
6. Add the vegetable broth. Put the cover on the pot. Wait until the carrots
   and potato are soft. This might take more than 20 minutes.
7. Blend the potato / carrots in the pot. You don't have to make it completely
   smooth, some people like it if there are some pieces left. Add the whipped
   cream.
8. Taste it. Is it too "stiff"? Then add more vegetable broth. Check if enough
   salt / spices are in there.
