Having a permanent colony in space where people can live their whole live is
an interesting thought. There are multiple potential ways to get there and I
would like to outline some of the ideas and their drawbacks.

A colony is self-sustaining if it can survive without contact to earth. One big
factor is to have a **minimum viable population**. The size of this is
estimated to be somewhere between 80[^1] up to 44,000[^2]. Other big factors
are the ability to protect against harmful environmental factors, to reproduce
biologically and the equipment. This means not only to be able to repair
equipment, but to produce all equipment by resources one can reach.


## Needs

A self-sustaining colony needs to have air and water. It needs to be able to grow food.
It needs to have energy.

### Energy

Solar power is certainly a sustainable solution. Nuclear energy would be
another potential solution.

### Air

### Water

### Food

### Habitation

Habitation needs to provide some basics to make it possible for humans to
survive:

* Radiation protection
* Graviation
* Temperature between 10°C to 30°C

Cosmic radiation causes cancer and kills live. On earth, the magnetic field
protects us.

If you build thick enough walls, probably any material can protect from
radiation. TODO

Water can protect from radiation. TODO


## Space Stations

Building a big station in space is the option where you might be able to see
most progress with the [International Space
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS).
However, the ISS has a mass of 419,725&thinsp;kg, a length of 73.0&thinsp;m and
a width of 109.0&thinsp;m. This allows a maximum crew size of 6 people. Even the
smallest population size for a permanent settlement assumes 80 people. This means
we have to go way bigger.

The ISS needed 420 tonnes of material and bringing one kg to space costs
about 25&thinsp;000 EUR[^4]. Meaning re-building the ISS would cost 10.5 billion
EUR. This is already pretty expensive. Building any of the proposals for permanent settlement
by bringing material from Earth to space is completely unrealistic. This means
we either have to mine materials from the moon or from asteriods.

Other problems all of the space station designs have to deal with:

* [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-g_environment): The human
  body did not evolve to be in micro-g environments. Using centrifugal forces
  to mimic gravitation could be possible.
* Radiation: One could put the space stations close enough to earth to benefit
  from its magnetic field.

Such a big space station is similar to a [generation ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship)


### Bernal sphere

The [Bernal sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernal_sphere) is a design
proposed by [John Desmond Bernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Bernal)
in 1929 for a space habitat capable of housing 20,000 to 30,000 permanent residents.


### Stanford torus

The [Stanford torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus) is a
proposed NASA design from 1975 for a space habitat capable of housing 10,000 to
140,000 permanent residents.

The total mass would be 10 million tons.

The movie [Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_(film)) contains a
stanford torus.


### O'Neill cylinder / Island Three

The [O'Neill cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) (Island Three) is
a design proposed by [Gerard K. O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill)
in 1976 for a space habitat capable of housing several million people.


## Asteroids

## The Moon

The moon cannot have an atmosphere[^6].

The communication with earth would be delayed between 1.2 and 1.4 seconds.

The temperature ranges from −247 °C to 123° C.

### Energy

A [lunar night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_day) takes about two weeks.
This means one needs batteries which can save energy that long or an alternative
enegery source to solar energy.

### Air

It might be possible to create oxygen from moon dust[^8].


### Water

There seems to be water on the surface of the moon, but it's by no means
clear to me how much it is and how easy it is to access.[^9]

### Food

[Lunar soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_soil)

### Habitats

As the moon does not have an atmosphere, the habitats need to be air-tight.

Lunar dust is super fine, which has [adverse health effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_health_effects_from_lunar_dust_exposure). This means the habitats need
an [airlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock) where the dust can be
cleaned away.



### Moon Village

The Moon Village is a concept presented in 2015 by the European Space Agency (ESA).

## Mars

The [colonization of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars)
is a fascinating thought which is shown in many different novels and movies.

It takes about nine months to bring humans to Mars[^5].

The [Mars atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars) is primarily
CO2

### Energy

Besides night, you can have dust storms on mars which could take weeks[^7].
This means it is necessary to have an alternative.

### Air

It might be possible to produce oxygen on the surface of Mars by the reaction

$$2 \text{CO}_2 \rightarrow  2 \text{CO} + \text{O}_2$$

The [MOXIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Oxygen_ISRU_Experiment)
should prove it.

### Water

There is [water on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_on_Mars)!


### Food

[Martian soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_soil#Toxicity) is toxic,
due to relatively high concentrations of perchlorate compounds containing
chlorine.
