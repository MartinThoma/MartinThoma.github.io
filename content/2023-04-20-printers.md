Printers are annoying and expensive. I have a broken laser printer and a
half-broken ink printer. I'm thinking about buying a thermal printer.

Before I buy something new, I typically do an extensive research as I hate
buying the wrong thing.

* I'm interested in the cost over 10 years.
* I'm only interested in WLAN printers.
* I guess I print about 7 pages in a week, makes 365 pages in a year. A total of
  3650 pages.
* The paper should have 80g/m², A4 format (standard paper)

Here are the results:

## Other considerations

* **Printer dimensions**: Laser printers are very bulky. You need space. There
  are a few super slim thermal printers.
* **Durability / Maintenance**: I had often issues with ink printers that they
  needed to be cleaned after they were not used for a while. My laser printer
  never had such issues.
