<div class="info">Draft: I want to share a couple of resources which I can't put directly in my thesis (such as code and trained models). I want to put a link in the thesis so that people know where to get it. This is a TODO for me ... come back at the end of Mai :-P</div>


## Thesis

* TODO (Link to arXiv)

## Models

For each of the 8 datasets you can find 10 trained baseline models and 10 trained
optimized models here: [zenodo.org/record/582892](https://zenodo.org/record/582892)

## Code

* TODO (Link to GitHub - make repo public)
