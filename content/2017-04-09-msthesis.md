## Thesis

* [Analysis and Optimization of Convolutional Neural Network Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09725)

## Models

For each of the 8 datasets you can find 10 trained baseline models and 10 trained
optimized models here: [zenodo.org/record/582892](https://zenodo.org/record/582892)

## Code

* [github.com/MartinThoma/msthesis-experiments](https://github.com/MartinThoma/msthesis-experiments)

## To be fixed

* STL-10 evaluation setup: I used the complete training set for training, but
  the datasets page gives 10-folds. Hence I have about 11% more labeled
  training data than intended.
