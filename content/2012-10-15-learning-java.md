I've just found some YouTube clips by <a href="//www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">thenewboston</a> in which he explains how to program in Java. I didn't watch them, but I took a look at some of them. Seems to be very easy to understand.

He starts right from the beginning (that means: how do I install Java?) explains basic concepts like variables, program flow statements and user input and goes to GUI with Swing:
