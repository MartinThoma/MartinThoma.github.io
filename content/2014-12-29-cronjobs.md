Cron is a very usefull service in Linux systems that allows periodical
execution of programs.

## Terms ##

The program that runs other programs periodically is called "[cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)".
The configuration file, that tells cron which programs should be run
periodically is called "crontab" and located in `/etc/crontab`.
One line in that file is called "cronjob".
But "crontab" is also a command that lets you add cronjobs.

## Example ##

The following entry in crontab means that `uamt.py` is executed
every day at 3:30 am:

```text
30 3 * * * /home/mthoma/uamt.py
```

You can check if everything went fine with

```bash
mthoma@i13srv30:~> crontab -l
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
# (/tmp/crontab.DEZBGc installed on Sat Jan  4 14:35:03 2014)
# (Cronie version 4.2)
30 3 * * * /home/mthoma/uamt.py
```
