Did you know that there are various differnt ways to build single-family
houses? For sure you know that one can build houses from concrete and bricks as
well as from wood, but there are some differences I've just recently learned
about. In this article I want to collect them.


## Brikawood

Brikawood houses are build from Lego-like wooden bricks. No screws, no glue.
Only wood pieces that fit well together. Aparently it is possible to build those
houses earthquake-proof ([Richter scale 8.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale), [source](http://www.inspiraction.news/en/2016/10/28/brikawood-an-ecological-house-built-with-wooden-bricks/)).

All Brikawood houses are [Passive houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house).


## Clay houses

* Fachwerk
* [Lehmhaus Rauch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmhaus_Rauch)
* [Lehmbau](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmbau)

Disadvantages:

* Heavy rain can destroy it: A part of the [Great Mosque of Djenné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Djenn%C3%A9) collapsed after 75 mm of rain had fallen in a 24-hour period


## Tiny House

* mobile
* max 18m^2

Think of a utility trailer for normal cars. Nothing for trucks. For example,
6.15m x 2.35m (inner part: 4.61m x 2.21m) with a maximum weight of 3000kg, where
the trailer itself weights 990kg. Or the Wörmann Team-Liner 3573/244.

## Self-Sufficiency

Self-sufficient houses are sometimes also called off-grid houses. The idea is
the be independent of the rest of the world.

### Electricity

You can generate electricity with solar panels. Other options you might think
of are not possible:

* Bio gas: You don't have enough biologic material to produce gass
* Geo-Thermi:
* Wind: Too big - you might not want that in your garden. And you might not be allowed to have something that big in your garden


* Solar-Wechselrichter
* Batterie-Wechselrichter

You also need a way to store energy for times when your solar panels don't produce
electric energy (e.g. at night):

* Battery


### Heat

* [Heat Pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump), Gasheizung, Ölheizung, Pelletheizung
* Good insulation

You can also store heat:

* Ice storage
* Big, well-insulated water tanks (half a year of storage time!)


### Clean Water


### Water cleaning

The biggest factor for sure is the toilet. There are composting toilets and
toilets which seperate diretly between poo and pee.


### Food

* Green-house
* Chicken for eggs
* Trees: Apples, Pears
* [Ribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribes)


## Jobs

The following professions are needed to build a house:
