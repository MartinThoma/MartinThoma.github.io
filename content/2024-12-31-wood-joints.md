You can connect two pieces of wood in many ways. Here are some of them.

## Glue (Leim ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)

You glue two flat pieces of wood together. Use clamps.

You should glue long grain to long grain.

## Nails

Good when you have a lot of shear force, but little tensile force.

## Screws

Avoid screwing into end-grain. It will easily come out. You need to screw into
long grain.

Countersinks are nice.

* Threaded inserts (metal threaded sleeves): Drill a hole in the wood and
  screw in the metal thread. Then you can securely screw a screw into the
  metal thread.
* Cam connectors (Exzenterverbinder)

## Pocket-Hole Jigs

Pocket screws have a flat head that functions as a miniature clamp.

Construction screws have a conical head that bores into the wood so that the screw sits flush.

## Threaded Inserts

Easy to assemble and disassemble.

## Biscuits

Compressed pieces of wood (biscuits). You use a biscuit to join two pieces of wood.
You need a slot in the wood.

Good for small projects like picture frames

## Dowels

You drill a hole into both pieces of wood and put a dowel in it. Use a
self-centering jig that clamps to the wood to get the holes straight.


## Festool Domino

Like a thick biscuit. You need a special machine to use it.

## Interlocking Joints

* Miter joint
    * Miter joint with spline
    * Frame miter joint vs Case miter joint


### Dovetails

Looks really nice.

* Dovetail joint
    * Through dovetail
    * Half-blind dovetail
    * Secret mitered dovetail
    * Sliding dovetail
