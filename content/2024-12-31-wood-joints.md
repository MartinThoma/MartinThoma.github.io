There are many ways to connect two pieces of wood. Here are some of the most common methods.

## Glue (Leim ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)

Glue two flat pieces of wood together using clamps to apply pressure while the adhesive sets.

For the strongest bond, always glue long grain to long grain.

## Nails

Nails work well when you need to resist shear force but don't expect much tensile (pulling) force.

## Screws

Avoid screwing into end grain, as screws will easily pull out. Instead, screw into the long grain for a secure connection.

Countersinks create a professional finish by allowing screw heads to sit flush with the wood surface.

* **Threaded inserts** (metal threaded sleeves): Drill a hole in the wood and
  screw in the metal thread. This allows you to securely fasten screws into the
  metal threads, creating a strong, reusable connection.
* **Cam connectors** (Exzenterverbinder): Hardware used for quick assembly and disassembly.

## Pocket-Hole Jigs

Pocket screws have a flat head that functions as a miniature clamp, pulling the joint tight.

Construction screws have a conical head that bores into the wood, allowing the screw head to sit flush with the surface.

## Threaded Inserts

These provide a strong connection that's easy to assemble and disassemble repeatedly without damaging the wood.

## Biscuits

Biscuits are compressed pieces of wood that expand when moistened with glue. You cut matching slots in both pieces of wood and insert the biscuit to create the joint.

This method works well for small projects like picture frames and edge-to-edge panel gluing.

## Dowels

Drill corresponding holes in both pieces of wood and insert wooden dowels with glue to create the joint. Use a self-centering dowel jig that clamps to the wood to ensure the holes align perfectly.


## Festool Domino

Similar to a thick, oblong biscuit, the Domino system requires a specialized Festool machine to cut precise mortises. It creates very strong joints and is popular among professional woodworkers.

## Interlocking Joints

* **Miter joint**: Two pieces cut at complementary angles (typically 45Â°) to form a corner
    * Miter joint with spline: Reinforced with a thin strip of wood
    * Frame miter joint vs. case miter joint: Different applications for frames versus boxes

### Dovetails

Dovetail joints are both functional and decorative, creating an attractive and extremely strong connection.

* **Dovetail joint** variations:
    * Through dovetail: Visible from both sides
    * Half-blind dovetail: Visible from only one side
    * Secret mitered dovetail: Hidden connection
    * Sliding dovetail: Allows controlled movement along one axis
