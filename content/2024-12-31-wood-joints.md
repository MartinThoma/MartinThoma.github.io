You can connect two pieces of wood in many ways. Here are some of them.

## Glue (Leim ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)

You glue two flat pieces of wood together. Use clamps.

You should glue long grain to long grain.

## Nails

Good when you have a lot of shear force, but little tensile force.

## Screws

Avoid screwing into end-grain. It will easily come out. You need to screw into
long grain.

Countersinks are nice.

* Einschraubmuffe: Man macht ein Loch ins holz, schraubt das Metallgewinde
  rein. Dann kann man eine Schraube sicher in das Metallgewinde schrauben.
* Exzenterverbinder

## Pocket-Hole Jigs

Pocket screws have a flat hat that functions as a minature clamp.

Construction screws have a conical hat bores into the wood so that the screw sits flush.

## Threaded Inserts

Easy to assemble and disassemble.

## Busikits

Compressed piece of wood. You use a busikit to join two pieces of wood.
You need a "slot" in the wood.

Good for small projects like picture frames

## Dowels

You drill a hole into both pieces of wood and put a dowel in it. Use a
self-centering jig that clamps to the wood to get the holes straight.


## Festool Domino

Like a thick Busikit. You need a special machine to use it.

## Interlocking Joints

    * Frame mitre joint vs Case mitre joint


### Dovetails

Looks really nice.
