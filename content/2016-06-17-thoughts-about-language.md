Language is a method of communication. It is used to transport information
from one individuals brain to another brain. I'm not entirely sure about it,
but I think every language which is wide-spread might be complete in a sense
that once you know every word of the language you will be able to convey any
concept or idea. In fact, even a tiny subset of natural languages might be
enough to transport those ideas.


## Basic components of a complete language

A complete language is always specific for the species for which it is used as
one fundamental part is to describe **sensory inputs**. For example, bees can
see other parts of the spectrum. They might describe flowers very different
from us. Some of the sensory words are:

* pain
* bright, dark, red, blue, round, rectangular, straight, curved
* sweet, bitter
* smokey, stinking
* hard / soft, warm / cold, rough


Another fundamental part of complete language are **relationships**:

* Spacial: A is over / below / right of B
* Temporal: A is before / after B
* Structural: A is part of B; A is a type of B
* Comparing: A is smaller than B; A is better than B; A is higher than B


Thinking about this, there seem to be many **conceptual words** which cannot be
explained with the ones given before:

* Language, knowledge, idea, wisdom, time, space



## Other components of natural languages

Natural languages are much more than complete languages. They have words to
define new words. Many words can be completely described with other words, but
it is cumbersome to use many sentences instead of a single word.

Also, there are synonyms, filling words, words and grammar which helps to
distinguish other words and make sure the other one does not missunderstand
you.


## Conclusions

There are two important conclusions from these thoughts:

First, the purpose of language is to convey ideas. This means one the one hand
that you should use language like others do most of the time. On the other
hand, there are some circumstances where you might want to ignore the
"official" writing (e.g. in German "**das** Kalman-Filter" would be correct,
but most people would intuitively say "**der** Kalman-Filter" - going with the
intuitive version is fine here).

Second, it might be possible to define a minimal complete language to describe
the world.
