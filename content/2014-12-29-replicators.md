<div class="info">This is a quick article I had for quite a while as a draft. It might not be finished or have other problems, but I still want to share it.</div>

What would you need to explore space? There are some ideas in science
fiction like [interstellar arks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_ark)
and near lightspeed travel. But one concept might be easier to realize:
Self-replicating, autonomous machines.

## The Problem of Interstellar Arks

Interstellar arks are space ships that are of enourmous size. They are big
enough to have enough humans on it so that those humans can have childens over
an limitles time without getting into trouble because of incest. [Traill et al. [2007]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320707002534) suggests that you
need about 4000 individuals for a minimal viable population.

Those 4000 people would need food, air, personal space. You would need resources
to repair the ship and explore planets. Medicine. You would need fuel.
That would be a lot of stuff.

Bringing stuff from earth to space is expensive.

And those people would eventually be trapped on
that ship for many, many generations before they might find another habitable
planet. You might eventually need to do [terraforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming). I can't even imagine the number of resources that would be needed for that.

The next problem is that you would want the explorers to keep contact with
earth. Those signals would either have to be highligh redundant (see [error correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correcting_codes)) or they might get
received only partially. So eventually you would like to get relay stations
that catch up the signal, correct errors (or request a new send of the broken part)
and send it again.

An ark would have to carry everything for that. That's a problem because sending
so much stuff from earth to space is expensive.

## The alternative: Replicating Machines

An alternative might be replicating machines. Machines don't need personal space.
They don't need air. They don't need food or medicine. They don't run into
psychical problems.

But they do need energy. They need resources. And they either need to be really
intelligent or they need to have clear instructions.

I a working minimal space exploring construction kit (let's call it MISECK, because
that's much shorter than 'minimal space exploring construction set') should be
able to do the following:

* **Construct other MISECKs** from resources that can be found in space (e.g. on asteroids, moons or planets). The plural was intended. Every MISECK would have to be able to
produce at least two other MISECKs.
* Build **communication satelites**: That communication satelite would act as a relay station. It talks with other satelites, receives messages and sends messages. It is able to check if the received message has errors and request a new message in case of errors. They should also store as much information as possible. This way, one could eventually contact them and get information
that might otherwise get lost.
* Build **exploration satelites** which can gather information about a planet. This information should be send to the communication satelites and finally back to earth.
* Build **mining and construction robots** that are able to mine all resources needed to construct MISECKS. That will include melting ore and constructing fabrics which are able to produce computer chips.
* Build **power plants**. Those might be solar cells, fusion/fission reactors or something completely different. But something has to provide the energy to make it possible to run all those machines and to travel enormous distances in space.
* **Explore and coordinate**: This is a collaborative planning task. MISECKs
  have to know where other MISECKs are. If one MISECK gets destroyed by
  anything, there might still be something that is worth exploring.
