[Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) is a free editor written by Microsoft. Its first release was in 2015, and boy did that one take off. It has [over 28k questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code), is the 2nd most-used Python editor according to the [2019 Jetbrains survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/python/), and the most popular one according to the [2019 StackOverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments). VS Code has its own [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode), works on [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows), [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions), and [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac). Microsoft has created a powerful language server called [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) about which you certainly also want to read something ‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs first start with the basics.

When you first start VS Code, it offers you a couple of plugins that might be helpful. I directly installed the Python integration as well as the Sublime Text key bindings. Keep especially the key bindings part in mind when I write about shortcuts.

## Speed

VS Code takes a bit more than a second to start. This means it‚Äôs way faster than [PyCharm](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/pycharm-professional-python-editors-in-review-b978f0e5c4ba), but slower than Sublime Text. VS Code stores everything, even if you don‚Äôt hit `Ctrl+S`. This means you can at all times just close the editor. The next time you open it, it will tell you that there are unsaved changes üòç

## The User Interface

In the screenshot above you can see what I have typically opened:

* The **editor** where you can read the code. Of course with Syntax highlighting and line numbers.
* The **explorer** where you can see the files of the workspace.
* The **activity bar** is left of the explorer. Here you can switch the explorer against a search tool, a version control system (VCS) integration, the debugger, and others. This was the main reason why I didn‚Äôt like VS code in the beginning. However, you can simply hide it üòç
* Right of the code, there is a **minimap** of the code. This can be helpful to jump to weird sections.

## Command Palette

The [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) is the way to reach any functionality of the editor. No more searching in deeply nested menus ‚ù§Ô∏è

You can open the command palette with the key combination `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`. It looks like this:

Although I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint why, I like the command palette of Sublime Text slightly more and the one of PyCharm way less. To me, it feels as if the fuzzy search of Sublime Text is best. Visually, VS Code did a really good job.

## Customizable Shortcuts!

VS Code has an official cheat sheet for the default key bindings ([source](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf)) and I already mentioned that you can use the default key bindings of other editors. That is neat, but I want to be able to customize it completely to my needs.

And, of course, you can do that! VS Code even offers you a pretty nice interface which acknowledges that you might want different actions depending on the situation / the programming language.

### Tab Interactions

You can close a tab with `Ctrl+W` , just like in Chrome. You can switch to the first tab with `Alt+1`, to the second with `Alt+2`, ‚Ä¶

You can open a new file with `Ctrl+N` ‚Äî just like you would open a new window in Chrome.

### Jump to Line

`Ctrl+G` to jump to a line. This is super handy when you‚Äôre debugging.

### Goto File

`Ctrl+P` to go to any file in the current workspace. With fuzzy search again üéâ

### Find / Replace all

`Ctrl+F` to find something, `Ctrl+H` to replace. You can also use regex! Definitely a feature I don‚Äôt want to miss. This is pretty cool in combination with multiple cursors! (`Ctrl+Shift+L`)

### Zen mode

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and search for ‚ÄúZen‚Äù. Within that mode, you have the code. No mini-map, no file explorer, no footer. This is helpful if you want to show another developer something. And you can adjust what is shown in Zen mode. For example, I still want to see the line numbers.

## Autocompletion

VS Code + [pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) offers an AMAZING autocompletion üíò Please be aware that you need to tell it a little bit about what you‚Äôre doing. Use type annotations to help VS Code to help you. By the way, [type annotations are awesome](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/type-annotations-in-python-3-8-3b401384403d)!

## Signature hints

I sometimes want to get a hint about the signature of a function. In VS Code, you just hover over the name and you get it. The box contains the docstring üòç

## Jump to Definition

Click on whatever you‚Äôre interested in and press F11 . That‚Äôs it. It works. And works so well and smoothly! You can do this with anything: Functions, variables, 3rd party stuff, core library stuff.

## Debugging

The debugging interface for Visual Studio Code is lightweight and has exactly what you need in most cases: (1) You can click in the gutter where you want to set your break points. (2) You can start the debugger by clicking in the activity bar on the play button. Here you can also see the current value of all variables. (3) Continue, step over, step into, step out, restart and stop the debugger. (4) Observe the output in the terminal.

## Customizations

Visual Studio code offers plenty of ways to customize. You have hundreds of settings, color themes, and plugins.

### Themes

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`, search for ‚Äútheme‚Äù:

### Settings

![Screenshot was taken by the author](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2320/1*YjHf_pXmRcPkbSI9Oo5CJg.png)*Screenshot was taken by the author*

You can also customize things via a settings.json file. Here are some settings I like, using the [Ubuntu Mono](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/UbuntuMono) font:

```json
{
    "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
    "editor.fontFamily": "Ubuntu Mono",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "textmate",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/moose/.pyenv/shims/python",
    "zenMode.hideLineNumbers": false,
    "zenMode.hideStatusBar": false,
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "/home/moose/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/lib/python3.8/site-packages"
    ],
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.background": "#373633",
        "terminal.foreground": "#dfdbd2",
    },
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Ubuntu Mono derivative Powerline"
}
```

### Workspaces

You can customize which files/folders are ignored within your [workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings). For example, create a .vscode/settings.json and add the following content for Python projects:

```json
{
    "files.watcherExclude": {
        "**/.pytest_cache/**": true
    },
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/.mypy_cache": true,
        "**/.pytest_cache": true,
        "**/*.egg-info": true,
        "**/mypy-report": true
    }
}
```

## Plugins

Finally, the time has come to talk about the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) and especially pylance!

### pylance

[Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) is a Python language server. As a user, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it too much. Think of it as a plugin which gives you autocompletion, signature help, type checking and much more. It‚Äôs especially awesome if you [use type annotations](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/type-annotations-in-python-3-8-3b401384403d).

As a developer who is wondering how things work under the hood, I must appreciate this nice design from Microsoft. They factored out one hard part so that a separate team can work on it. In theory, this could be integrated into other editors/IDEs/services. In practice, [the license forbids it](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/4#issuecomment-654083567). Also, defining such a [language server interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide) allows developers to create language servers for other languages as well üåü Having this interface is a sign of good software architecture.

### Honorable Mentions

* [**SQLTools**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools): Running DB queries from within VS Code

* [**Live Share**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare): Pair programming support in Corona times. I haven‚Äôt tried this plugin so far, though.

## Comparison: VS Code vs Sublime Text vs PyCharm

Compared with Sublime Text, VS Code initially felt a bit more heavy-weight to me. However, this might simply be due to the fact that I‚Äôm using Sublime Text since roughly 2010 (I‚Äôve bought the license in 2014). Having 10 years of experience in one tool means that you get used to that tool quite a bit. Except for the fact that Sublime is incredible fast, I don‚Äôt see any advantage of it over VS Code.

Compared to PyCharm Professional, VS Code feels much more lightweight. It‚Äôs faster and the interface is cleaner. I‚Äôm not absolute certain, but pylance might also be better than the autocompletion of PyCharm. The advantages of PyCharm are in the edge cases: The database tool window, SciView, maybe some debugging features, and for sure the [code inspections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/code-inspection.html).

## Summary

Microsoft did an amazing job with VS Code: It‚Äôs fast, customizable, has the necessary features, a marketplace, reasonable defaults, a clean interface, support for Windows/Mac/Linux and is for free. Kudos! I love it! üíú
