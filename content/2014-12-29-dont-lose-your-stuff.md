<div class="info">This is a quick article I had for quite a while as a draft. It might not be finished or have other problems, but I still want to share it.</div>

It is very annoying when you buy something expensive and you lose it or it
gets stolen. But there are some technical solutions to prevent that.

## Crowd GPS Tags

Crowd GPS devices use Bluetooth and connect with Smartphones. Whenever another
person has the App installed, he/she sends the location of all devices to a
server. This means as long as anybody is near the GPS tag, you can hope to
find your stuff again.

### Tile

[Tile](https://www.thetileapp.com) is such a crowd GPS device.

There is no android app yet.

### TinTag

[TinTag](http://thetintag.com/)
is a 28mm × 39.2mm device. Its battery lasts for 4 months. It has an LED and
a buzzer as well as bluetooth. The bluetooth connection lasts for 100m.

It has a [indigogo campagain](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tintag-the-first-rechargeable-item-tracker/x/7191655). 10 Tintag devices and 1 base charger cost
105 US-Dollar.

Tintag app works on Android phones (version 4.3 and 4.4) and iPhone. It doesn't
work yet on Windows Phones or Blackberry.

### TrackR bravo

[TrackR bravo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/trackr-bravo-the-thinnest-item-tracking-device-ever/x/7191655) is just another tagging device.

TrackR is compatible with Android 4.4 (see [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonehalo.itemtracker)) and iPhone 4s & later, iPad 3rd Generation & later. It works with Bluetooth 4.0. It uses a CR1616 coin cell battery.

It is 31mm in diameter and 3.5mm height.

It can detect bluetooth devices up to 30m.

One TrackR costs 29 US-Dollar, 10 cost 99 US-Dollar.

### StickNFind

[StickNFind](https://www.sticknfind.com/) is probably the smallest Crowd GPS
tag. It was [on indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sticknfind-bluetooth-powered-ultra-small-location-stickers/x/7191655)
and raised 931.870 US-Dollar.

It works with Android and iOS, as long as you have Bluetooth 4.0.

## Bicycles

Bicycles sometimes have a number on the frame. In German, it is called
[Fahrradrahmennummer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrradrahmennummer). In
Germany, you can sometimes go to the police and they will add such a number
to your bike. In case it gets stolen and the police finds it, they can look
at their records and give it back to you. Eventually. I'm not sure how good
this works. But it doesn't cost anything, so why not?

Another way is uglification. One way to do this is using [these stickers](http://dominicwilcox.com/portfolio/anti-theft-carbike-device/).

Another way is putting lots of reflecting stuff on it. That has the advantage
of giving you extra security as drivers can see you more easily.

## USB-Sticks

I always add a `README.txt` to the USB stick with the following content:

```text
## German
Dieser USB-Stick gehört Martin Thoma.

Wenn er verloren wurde, wäre es toll, wenn Sie eine E-Mail an
info@martin-thoma.de schreiben würden.
--------------------------------------------------------------
## English
This USB stick belongs to Martin Thoma.

If it was lost, please send an e-mail to info@martin-thoma.de.
```

## Luggage

I always leave a note in my luggage with the following content:

```text
Martin Thoma
Parkstr. 17
76131 Karlsruhe
Tel.: XXXX
E-Mail: info@martin-thoma.de
```

## House

Locks and [keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock))... but you can lose your keys or forget them inside.

When you lose your keys, you have to replace all locks. That's a problem with
traditional keys. But I could imagine that a good [keycard lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keycard_lock) does not have this flaw. You "simply" tell the system
that a card was lost and replace the cheap card - not the expensive lock.
The card should only contain a long number. If the number is one of the allowed
numbers, one can enter. If not, the system locks for 2 seconds. That should
effectively prevent brute force.
