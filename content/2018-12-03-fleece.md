Another product article for Nepal ðŸ™‚ - this time it is about fleece sweaters.
Fleece sweaters are mid-layer. You have three layers:

* Base Layer: On your skin
* Mid Layer: Insulation
* Outer Layer: Against wind / rain / snow

Meaning the fleece is not meant to be wind or water proof, but to keep you
warm. I will use it for trekking. They don't insulate as well as down; I think
I will use them on the hike. The down is more for when I don't move.

Polartec Thermal Pro-Fleece seems to be a common material, Nanuk is the version
from Jack Wolfskin.
