The job as a software developer is pretty crazy: You need to learn constantly
about new technologies, understand topics within the domain youâ€™re working,
estimate how long it will take to build stuff you have never built before,
explain issues to people who have absolutely no clue. On top of all that, you
need to protect your software system against attackers. But the attackers are
usually not a problem â€” until they are. This means it can happen that security
receives little attention as it seems not to provide direct value. And when the
value becomes apparent, itâ€™s too late.

Considering that developers are so busy with many other topics and might have a
hard time to justify the need for security improvements, the security
improvements need to be part of the normal workflow. You want to have something
running completely automatically which takes care of that for you.

There are many different topics in security and many different tools. One group
of tools do so-called *software composition analysis* â€” SCA in short. After
reading this article you will understand what SCA is and how it helps you.

## Problem 1: Malicious Third-Party Software

Software that is written to cause harm can get into your dependencies. Either
by a typo and [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting)
attacker or by a trojan horse. A trojan horse is software that seems to be
useful but does something else.

## Problem 2: Vulnerable Third-Party Software

The more complex software becomes, the harder it is to have all relevant
aspects of it in your mind. This can lead to vulnerabilities â€” especially with
many contributors.

## Problem 3: Licenses of Third-Party Software

You can also run into legal issues. As an organization, you want to make your
mind up about which licenses are acceptable. The acceptable ones will be in an
allowlist. Then you want to automatically check any dependency regularly
against this allowlist.

Typical licenses are MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, LGPL, GPL, MPL.

Have a look at [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/) to get a quick overview.

## How SCA works

Checking for malicious and vulnerable third-party packages is simple:
Blocklists. If a version of a package (or the complete package) is known to
cause problems, it gets on a blocklist. SCA tools can check the blocklists and
prevent you from installing problematic software.

For the licenses, you need to have a way to extract the licenses from a
package. Some important things to consider:

* Package authors can add alternative licenses
* Package authors can add multiple licenses which all need to be fulfilled
* Package authors can (technically) not give any license â€” that means you
  cannot use it!
* Package authors can give inconsistent licenses, e.g. in Python, there are at
  least 3 different common ways where you can denote the license.

## Prerequisite: Bill of Materials (BOM)

You need to know which third-party software you are using. For that, you create
a so-called *Bill of Materials*. Sounds fancy, but it really is just a list of
the software you use. The programming languages typically come already with
solutions for that:

* **Java**: pom.xml (see
  [dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html))

* **JavaScript**: [yarn.lock](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-lock/)
* **PHP**: [composer.lock](https://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#lock-file)
* **Python**: requirements.txt files with transitively-pinned dependencies,
  e.g. via pip-compile from [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools)
* **Ruby**: [Gemfile.lock](https://bundler.io/rationale.html)
* **Rust**: Cargo.tom â€” Iâ€™m uncertain if that contains transitive dependencies
  (see
  [dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html))

Please let me know about how this is called in other languages â€” I will expand
this list then.

## Examples for SCA Tools

Free solutions:

* **JavaScript**: [yarn audit](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/audit/)
  for vulnerabilities and [yarn
  licenses](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/licenses/) + scripting
  around it for licenses.
* **Python**: [safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) for vulnerabilities,
  [pip-licenses](https://pypi.org/project/pip-licenses/) for licenses.

Commercial solutions:

* [Blackduck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/)
* [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/): Iâ€™ve seen this on Github some times.
* [Snyk](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/) for
  vulnerabilities: You can see it in Github pretty often. Itâ€™s free for
  open-source software.

## Summary

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools can help you a lot and usually stay
in the background. Integrate them in your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline,
run them regularly as a scheduled task. In most cases, you donâ€™t have to do
anything. But when the tool complains, it is important.
