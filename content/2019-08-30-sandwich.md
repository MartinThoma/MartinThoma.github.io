I eat [sandwiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) a lot. I make them
myself.


## Ingredients

For two sandwiches (about 4 sandwiches are enough for dinner for one person):

* [Toast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast)
* 2 [sliced sausage](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:12-09-12-moorbad-freienwalde-18.jpg) - there are vegetarian options at Aldi which taste similar as well
* Some [table mustard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(condiment))
* Some [Balsamic Cream Vinegar](https://www.aldi-sued.de/de/angebote/wochenendaktion-ab-fr-267/detailseite-wochenendaktion-kw30/ps/p/cucina-creme-mit-aceto-balsamico-di-modena-igp-260/)
* 1 Tomato
* 4 [Small pickled cucumbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber)
* Some [french fried onions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_onion)
* Some cheese (I like [Emmental cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmental_cheese))

Additionally, if you like it:
