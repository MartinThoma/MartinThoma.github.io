A [customer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/customer) is somebody who buys goods, e.g. in a supermarket. Or somebody who buys services like at a hairdresser.

A [client](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/client) uses professional advisors and services. Accountants, architects, attorneys, consultants, and sex workers have clients.
