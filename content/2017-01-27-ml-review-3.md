This Review gives an overview of intersting stuff I stumbled over which are
related to machine learning.


## New Developments

### Human-strenght and Super-human strength programs

Super-human strength programs are programs, which surpass even the best human
(on the long run) in a specified task. Human-strength programs behave similar
to an (untrained) human.

Although those are not new, seeing them as a list ([source](http://blog.evjang.com/2017/01/nips2016.html))
was new to me. However, except for the games and lip reading, I doubt that we
are there yet. Interesting, non the less:

* Games
    * 1995, Checkers: [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_(draughts_player))
    * 1996, Chess: [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
    * 2016, Go: [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)
* Lip reading: 2016, [Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05358) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aogzAUPilE))
* Speech transcription: 2016, [Achieving Human Parity in Conversational Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05256)
* Translation: 2016, [Zero-Shot Translation with Google’s Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html)
* Driving: 2016, [Waymo](https://waymo.com/)

## Live Demos and Websites


* [universe.openai.com](https://universe.openai.com/): Related to the OpenAI gym.
* [Project Malmo](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2016/03/13/project-malmo-using-minecraft-build-intelligent-technology/): Train RL agents in Minecraft
