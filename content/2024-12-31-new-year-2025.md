It‚Äôs New Year's Eve; as always ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to remember what happened and think
about what might happen in the future.

## Review of 2024

The US convicted Donald Trump of felony crimes in a scheme to illegally
influence the 2016 election. Then a majority of the US voted to have him as the
next president.

The [German government collapsed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholz_cabinet) in 2024, leading to the decision to hold
new elections in 2025. This happened because the FDP (the liberals), one of the
three parties in the government coalition, believed it would be in their best
interest to break up the government. Instead of leaving the coalition cleanly, they
sabotaged it. They didn't want to leave voluntarily, but preferred to be dismissed.

## Old Year Predictions

### The Bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World

1. ‚úÖ The right-wing party AfD gets stronger in Germany: There is the EU election
   and 13 regional elections in Germany in 2024. I expect AfD, a right-wing
   party, to become way stronger in those overall: AfD increased their members
   in local parlaments from 238 to 247 ([source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sitzverteilung_in_den_deutschen_Landesparlamenten&diff=245393117&oldid=240217579))
2. ‚úÖ Ukraine: Still no peace. Putin just said that Russia will never move back
   (source). I think that the support of the west will continue to be strong
   enough that the area is in war, but not strong enough to push Russia away.
3. ‚úÖ Renewables and electrification: A massive boost in installed renewable
   energy and a steady increase in electrification in transport and heating.

### Technology

5. ‚ùå We will see a first game with free-form chat interactions with NPCs.
6. ‚úÖ Solid-State Batteries will still not be a mass-produced thing.
7. ‚úÖ Nuclear Fusion: It is unclear if nuclear fusion will be economically viable.

### About Me

8. ‚úÖ Side Hustle: I‚Äôll finally start one: I didn't start my own, but support a
   friend. I think it still counts üòÉ
9. ‚úÖ Blogging: I‚Äòve published 30 articles: I've published 29 articles on Medium
   and a couple of smaller ones on my blog here.
10. ‚ùå Fitness: I will walk and cycle more in each month of 2024 than in the same
    months of 2023.

## New Year Predictions

### The Bigger Picture: Politics, Nature and the World

1. **Germany**: The new government will be a coalition of [CDU/CSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU/CSU) and [SPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany).
2. **US**: [The Consumer price index](https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/consumerpriceindexhistorical_us_table.htm) will rise each month by at least 4% for each
   month beginning with May, assuming Trump actually does his tariffs.
3. **Syria**: Things will become better as measured by [World Press Freedom Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index), the [Fragile States Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Fragile_States_Index), and the [Economist Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index)

### Technology

4. **Eletric Vehicles**: We will see a world-wide increase in sales.
5. **Cleaner Energy Mix**: We will see a relative drop in the [primary energy consumption of coal and gas](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix), hopefully also oil. Solar and Wind will increase.
6. **AI-powered Games**: More flexible dialogues, more realistic NPCs, or more dynamic worlds.

### About Me

8. **Blogging**: I‚Äòve published 30 articles.
9. **Fitness**: I will walk and cycle more in each month of 2025 than in the same
    months of 2024.
10. **DIY**: I will have finished at least one of the following: Build a nice
    raised garden bed, build a concrete table, or renovated one of the cellar
    rooms.
