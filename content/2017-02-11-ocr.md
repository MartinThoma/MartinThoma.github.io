OCR (optical character recognition) is the conversation of an image which
contains text into machine readable text. In form of data formats, you put a
JPG in and you receive a txt or a PDF (which contains text, not just the
image).

The reason why OCR is important, is that it makes images searchable. For
example, I have a lot of handwritten notes which I want to digitalize. So I
will scan those notes. But when I want to find anything in them, I will search
for parts of the content (e.g. "statistik"). Also, if OCR works really well
it could help you to read documents. Especially if you have notes from people
like me with an aweful handwriting.

For the rest of this article, please keep in mind that I didn't write an OCR
software so far.


## How it can work

Here is a very simple approach how OCR could work:

1. **Segmentation**: First try to find lines. Then try to segment single
   characters.
2. **Classification**: Given the segments, find what symbol is in them.
3. **Placement**: Find the relationship between two classified symbols (is one
   to the right of the other or rather the the right-top? Hence: Is it $ax$ or
   $a^x$?


## Why it's hard

1. Everybody has a unique handwriting.
2. There are different alphabets in the world. Much more than what you have in
   English.
3. Even the same alphabet has a lot of variance between countries. For example,
   The digit `1` is often written as a single line in the US. But in Germany,
   we use two lines (more similar to the printed version of `1`). Some people
   even make 3 lines.
4. Overlapping characters (especially in cursive handwriting)
5. Really weird placement (especially in mathematics)
6. Tables within the handwriting
7. Images within the handwriting


## Datasets

I am currently looking for datasets (see [question on opendata.stackexchange.com](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/q/10626/5487)). I'm thinking about publishing my
notes as an unlabeled dataset.


## A benchmark page

Lets take [this image](//martin-thoma.com/images/2017/02/scan-thoma-1-1-statistik.jpg)
as a benchmark. It is written in German, with mainly mathematical content.

Several things to note here:

* I had to tell it that the document is written in German
* The recognition of the handwritten part did not work at all
* The recognition of the printed part was perfect, except that the placement is
  wrong
* Trailing whitespaces 🙈

Things to note here:

* I had to tell it that the document is written in German
* It supports multiple languages in the same document 🙂
* I removed a lot of empty lines in between
* The recognition of the handwritten part did not work at all.
* The recognition of the printed part was pretty good, but not perfect.
* The placement worked for the printed part
* Trailing whitespaces 🙈
