In the past years I didn't play Magic the Gathering, but now I might do so
again. I found some interesting multiplayer rules in the past, but I don't
remember where. So here is what I found.

## 3 Players

### 1 vs 1 vs 1

Everybody has 20 lives and the first player may not draw a card. Just as usual
in 1 vs 1.

## 4 Players

### 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1

### 2 vs 2

* 40 Lives for both parties
* Turns:
    1. Player 1 of group 1 starts,
    2. then player 1 of group 2,
    3. then player 2 of group 1,
    4. then player 2 of group 2
* Turn structure: Just like in 1 vs 1

## Planechase

* 3 to 6 players
* Each player needs a normal minimum 60-card Constructed deck and a planar deck
  of at least 10 plane cards

> Planechase gives you everything you need to play Planar Magic, a new casual
> variant that sends you and your friends on a tour through the Multiverse.
> Each plane you visit—represented by a plane card—changes the nature of the
> battlefield. You never know how long you'll stay or where you'll go next, and
> the result is an ever-shifting race to exploit the unique nature of the plane
> you're on ... or to planeswalk away from a plane that your enemies can take
> advantage of!
