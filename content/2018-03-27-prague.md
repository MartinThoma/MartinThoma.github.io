[Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague) is the capital of the Czech
Republic.


## Getting there

I chose to get to Prague by bus as it's only about [390km by car / bus](https://goo.gl/maps/Mz45UZMtAxr).
I recommend to have a look at [busliniensuche.de](https://www.busliniensuche.de)
to find a good bus, although the market is dominated by [Flixbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flixbus).

Getting to Prague:

```
06:40 ab Home, MetroBus 56 direction Fürstenried West
06:46 an Pasing Bf, Gleis 9

06:53 ab Pasing, S3 direction Holzkirchen, Gleis 5/6
07:01 an Hackerbrücke, Gleis 1

07:07 an Munich, ZOB

07:35 ab Munich, ZOB, BUS 42050
12:40 an Praha hl.n.

12:59 ab Central Station, "C" Letňany (4 stations: Florenc, )
13:07 an Kobylisy

13:12 an Hotel Aida, Kubišova 1953/23, 182 00 Praha 8
```

Getting back from Prague to Munich:

```
17:15 ab Praha hl.n., Bus 42057
21:55 an Munich ZOB

22:19 ab Hackerbrücke, Gleis 2 mit S3 Mammendorf
22:27 an Pasing, Gleis 7/8

22:34 ab Pasing, Bstg. 2, 56 Schloss Blutenburg
```


### Packing List

* For the bus trip (for one person):
    * 1 banana
    * 1 apple
    * 2 small bottles of water
    * 4 slices of bread (chreese and sausage)
    * 1 package Muesli rigel
    * 1 package disinfecting tissues
    * 3 packages tissues
* Oranization
    * Tickets for the jorney (both: to prague and back)
    * [Hotel booking](https://www.booking.com/) (Hotel AIDA in my case)
    * Money (cash, at least 320&nbsp;CZK for a 3 day ticket)
    * ID-card / passport
* Clothes
    * Underwear
    * Sleeping clothes
* Hygiene
    * Toothbrush
    * Toothpaste
    * Shampoo


### Money

The Czech Republic has the [Czech koruna (CZK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_koruna).
I always try to have a bit of non-electronic money in case something goes wrong.
It was super hard to get CZK in Munich with Sparkasse. I went to Marienplatz
only to be told that I'm a customer of "Sparkasse Karlsruhe" so I have to pay
5&nbsp;EUR. For them, it's as if I'm not a customer of Sparkasse at all. Very
disapointing.

So I went to [Reisebank](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reisebank) at HBF Munich.
No long lines, but I had to pay a fee of 3.78&nbsp;EUR. They applied an exchange
rate of 0.0445714, whereas Google [1 CZK in EUR](https://www.google.de/search?q=1+CZK+in+EUR&oq=1+CZK+in+EUR)
shows 0.0392576328&nbsp;EUR, which means they demand 14% more money.

For N26, withdrawing another currenzy seems to be free ([source](https://docs.n26.com/legal/bank-account/de/n26-016-preisliste-de.pdf))? Let's see...


## Public Transportation

See [dpp.cz](http://www.dpp.cz/en/fares-in-prague/). 310&nbsp;CZK for a 3-day
