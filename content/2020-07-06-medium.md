I recently started publishing articles on Medium, as you might have noticed.
The reason for this is simple: I'm wondering how much money I can make with the
kind of articles I like to write.

On this blog, I receive something like 10 EUR
per year via [paypal.me](https://www.paypal.me/MartinThoma). By the way:

A big "Thank you" to [the contributors](https://martin-thoma.com/support-me/#contributions)!

In the cost list below, you can see that I loose about 66 EUR with my blog and
my extra services. This is not even considering all the time I put into it.


## Current Cost

Here you can see the costs I roughly have each year. It's only roughly because
the prices and the exchange rage (USD â†” EUR) change.

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Cost</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://martin-thoma.com/">martin-thoma.com</a></td>
            <td>14 EUR</td>
            <td>Domain at namecheap.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="http://www.martin-thoma.de/">martin-thoma.de</a></td>
            <td>31 EUR</td>
            <td>Domain+Hosting at hosting.de; here I have my main e-mail address</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="http://write-math.com/">write-math.com</a></td>
            <td>14 EUR</td>
            <td>Domain at namecheap.com</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="http://write-math.com/">write-math.com</a></td>
            <td>17 EUR</td>
            <td>Hosting at namecheap.com</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <td>Total</td>
            <td>76 EUR</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>
</table>


## Export from Medium

Kudos for this to [macropus](https://medium.com/@macropus/export-your-medium-posts-to-markdown-b5ccc8cb0050)!

*Prerequisites*

```bash
$ npm install -g mediumexporter
```

*Export*

```bash
$ mediumexporter https://medium.com/p/the-article > post.md
```

Sadly, you have to refine a lot:

1. Tags
2. Images have to be downloaded extra
3. Source code is still on git
4. Overall formatting



## What is cool

* It's possible to get paid. Not by advertisement, but by subscription.
* The editor is pretty nice
* Publications give extra reach
* I don't have to care about hosting


### Publications

I've now published in [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh/unit-testing-in-python-basics-21a9a57418a0), [Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/type-annotations-in-python-3-8-3b401384403d),
[Make it New](https://makeitnew.io/docker-ab1a6bddf389) and [Python in Plain English](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/killer-features-by-python-version-c84ca12dba8).

The advantage of publications is that you can reach new readers. That is one
reason why I'm trying to get into new publications. Also, it kind of resembles
the categories I have. So readers can choose a publication by the topic they
are interested in. In contrast, on my blog it's only me publishing articles.

I'm not quite sure how much quality assurance people do in the publications
on Medium. I guess it depends on the publication. But at least the big ones
seem to do have very rough glance at the articles.


## What is not cool

* **Missing Features**: Syntax highlighting, [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
* **Publication Rules**: One thing that annoys me is that you have to put a big
  stock image in the beginning of your article. It doesn't have to be related
  to the article at all. Do people really like that?
* **Synchronization**: I want to keep a copy of my articles so that I can
  easily find them again / publish them in another form. As I like to update
  my articles when I spot mistakes or just learn something new, this is quite
  a bit of work. Now I have to do it in two places.
* **Comments and Discussions**: I'm not sure how easy it is to comment and if I receive notifications.


### Missing Features

In this blog, I can easily create beautifully syntax-highlighted code blocks
by just using the fenced code block notation of Markdown. On Medium, I have to
make a Github gist.

In this blog, I create mathematical formulas in a variety of different ways.
Most of the time by the dollar notation for inline math and by the begin/end
align or by double dollar / fenced code blocks for bigger formulas. So I can
use the powerful LaTeX math notation. On Medium, I don't think this is possible
at all. So I will not create anything math-related on Medium.

In this blog, I use [`blacken-docs`](https://github.com/asottile/blacken-docs)
over my Python code snippets to make sure that they have a beautiful formatting
and don't have dumb typos. This is not possible with Medium.


## Summary

I'm going to publish some articles on Medium, but I keep adding them here as
well. I'm currently experimenting with adding a redirect from here, but you
can always look directly [in the source](https://github.com/MartinThoma/MartinThoma.github.io/tree/pelican/content)
for free.

What do you think about it?
