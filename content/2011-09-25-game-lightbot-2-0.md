<b>Task</b>: Solve the levels

<b>How to play</b>: You can programm the Lightbot to move, jump and to switch its light on. By defining functions and using recursion you can keep your program code small. It's a nice online game where you can start to learn programming.

<b>My Record</b>: All Basic and Recursion-Levels done.
