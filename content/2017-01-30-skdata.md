I really like Machine Learning. I like reading papers, understanding and
evaluating new ideas. But one part I always have to spend quite a bit of time
on is loading the data. It's always a mess to find the datasets, understand
where exactly I can download them and how they've packaged the information.
Just a few days ago I found `skdata`. It is a Python package which aims at
helping to load standard datasets. If I can trust the git commit message, then
the development was started in August 2011 by James Bergstra! This is before
AlexNet!

edit: Although it seemed to be a cool project, it seems to be dead, too. The
last commit is from July 2015.


## Usage

One way to use `skdata` is the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""MNIST example with skdata."""

try:
    from skdata.mnist.view import OfficialVectorClassification
except ImportError:
    # Fallback, if you have an old version
    from skdata.mnist.views import OfficialVectorClassification
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the data
view = OfficialVectorClassification()
train_idx = view.fit_idxs  # indices of training data
val_idx = view.val_idxs  # incices of validation data
test_idx = view.tst_idxs  # indices of test data

# Fit a simple classifier
print("Start fitting DecisionTreeClassifier.")
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
features = view.all_vectors[train_idx]  # select features of training data
targets = view.all_labels[train_idx]  # select labels of training data
clf.fit(features, targets)

# Evaluate the classifier
predict = clf.predict(view.all_vectors[test_idx])
accuracy = sum(predict == view.all_labels[test_idx]) / float(len(test_idx))
print("Fitted DecisionTreeClassifier has test accuracy of %0.4f." % accuracy)

```


However, it is inteded to be used like this:

```python
from skdata.mnist.view import OfficialVectorClassification
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the data
mnist_view = OfficialVectorClassification()
train_idx = mnist_view.fit_idxs
val_idx = mnist_view.val_idxs
test_idx = mnist_view.tst_idxs

# Fit a simple classifier
from skdata.base import SklearnClassifier
learning_algo = SklearnClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier)
mnist_view.protocol(learning_algo)
print(learn_algo.results['loss'][0]['task_name'] == 'tst')
```

... but this doesn't work (for me)
