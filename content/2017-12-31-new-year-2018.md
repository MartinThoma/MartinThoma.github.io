It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Review of 2017

TODO

Here are some other mentionable facts:

* [ML-KA](https://ml-ka.de/) is still active.
* I have TODO points on StackOverflow and reached TODO&nbsp;million people
  with my posts ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/martin-thoma)).
* I wrote TODO&nbsp;articles for this blog (including this one) in 2017. A couple
  of them might be interesting for a very specific audience (TODO).
* I've uploaded TODO&nbsp;files to Wikipedia Commons in 2017 (<a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/ptools/uploadsum.php?user=MartinThoma">source</a>). My uploads to Wikipedia Commons
  are about TODO&thinsp;GiB in total now. On commons, I made TODO&nbsp;edits in total.


### Old year resolutions

* <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> 03.02.2017: Get new slippers
* [ ] Get all my stuff from my fathers apartment to my room. I've already packed
  most of it in boxes (In total: 1.00m (+0.30m?) × 0.39m × 0.60m by 4 boxes)
* [ ] Finish my masters degree
* [ ] Participate in a Flashmob
* [ ] Get comfortable with Orange Bouldering routes (5c-6c) and finish at least
      5 harder ones (6c - 7b)
* [ ] Visit a country I haven't been to before.


### Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. Networks will not get deeper (currently: about 600 layers, max 2000 layers),
   but work about how to get the same accuracy with less parameters / FLOPs
   will be written.
2. GANs will be able to create 1024px x 1024px images.
3. An AI will play Star Craft and at least one nice video of it will be online.


About Me

4. I will publish at least two papers (one will be my masters thesis)
5. I will finish my masters degree.
6. I will publish at least 40 articles on my blog.
7. I will get at least 20&thinsp;000 points on StackOverflow (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/martin-thoma?tab=accounts))


Politics

8. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
   still exist and Britain will still be part of it, although somebody will
   be going in front of curt because of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).
9. German elections: 35% for CDU/CSU, 18% for SPD, 15% for AfD, 9% for Grüne,
   9% Linke.
10. Trump will not build a *complete* wall to Mexico.
