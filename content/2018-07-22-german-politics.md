## Details

### Cookie Law

The Problem: Virtually every website nowadays screams at you that it uses cookies.
This is not nice from an
[UX perspective](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40687/we-use-cookies-notice-on-websites),
it is useless from a privacy perspective and it might [actively harm small independent websites](http://www.dkriesel.com/blog/2018/0522_dsgvo_for_the_win).

The solution: Revert it. Completely. I don't see any use whatsoever for the user. On the contrary, it just makes websites worse.


### Mandatory Public Health Insurance

In Germany, people can opt-out from public health insurance and use a private
insurance instead. This is a problem as they usally opt-out as they would
otherwise pay more. And it is a problem as those people might be in need of it
later.

**The solution**: Don't allow op-out of public health insurances. I'm also not
too sure if the most severe cases should not be covered by a single insurance
for everybody which covers the basics. Other insurances can still exist, but
only as an additional service. For example, I could imagine parts in dental
care or glasses to be covered separately, while I expect anything
life-threatening or painful to go to the public health insurance.


### Chained short-term contracts

See [Kettenvertrag](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettenvertrag)


### Tax Declaration

The tax declaration is too complicated.

**The solution**: Make a website. The swedes make it pretty well ðŸ™‚


### Declare Place of Residency

You have to 


### Tax Avoidance


## Long-Term problems

I guess some problems will always be an issue:

* Healthcare
* Employment
* Poverty
