PEAR is short for <strong>P</strong>HP <strong>E</strong>xtension and <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>R</strong>epository. It provides a very easy method to get some common classes.

PEAR MDB2 is a database class. It is a successor of PEAR DB. I took a look at version 1.4.1 which is currently the latest stable one.

<h2>Install PEAR</h2>
You can install PEAR on Ubuntu via
```bash
sudo apt-get install php-pear
```

You can check if it is installed with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php">phpinfo()</a>:

```php
<?php phpinfo();?>
```

Something like <strong>.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear</strong> should be in your <strong>include_path</strong>.

<h2>Install PEAR MDB2</h2>
PEAR MDB2 is then simply installed via
```bash
sudo pear install MDB2
```

Then install the optional MySQL package:
```bash
sudo pear install pear/MDB2#mysql
```

<h2>Usage</h2>
I took a small chess database to test this package. You can set it up with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/community-chess/source/browse/trunk/install/chess.sql?spec=svn99&r=98">this sql file</a>.

It's sad, but only including <strong>MDB2.php</strong> shows 5 "Deprecated"-messages and 6 warings because of "Strict Standards".

You can easily connect to the database:

```php
require_once "MDB2.php";

$db   = new MDB2();
$dsn  = "mysql://chessuser:localpass@localhost/chess";
$mdb2 = MDB2::factory($dsn);
$mdb2->setFetchMode(MDB2_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
```

It is also very easy to fetch some data:

```php
$sql    = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`';
$result = $mdb2->query($sql);
while ($row = $result->fetchRow()) {
    print_r($row);
}
```

or 

```php
$sql    = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`';
$data = $mdb2->queryAll($sql);
print_r($data);
```

This results in:

```text
Array
(
    [user_id] => 1
    [user_name] => abc
    [user_password] => 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72
    [currentchesssoftware] => 0
)
Array
(
    [user_id] => 2
    [user_name] => test
    [user_password] => 098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6
    [currentchesssoftware] => 0
)
```

You can set limits via MDB2:

```php
$sql    = 'SELECT * FROM `chess_users`';
$mdb2->setLimit(1);
$data = $mdb2->queryAll($sql);
print_r($data);
```

MDB2 offers lots of other features like choosing a (non)persistent connection, prepared statements or debuggin option. If you're interested in PEAR MDB2 I recommend to take a look at installationwiki.org.
