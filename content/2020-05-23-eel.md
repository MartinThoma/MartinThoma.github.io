[Eel](https://pypi.org/project/Eel/) is a little Python library for making
simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI apps, with full access to Python
capabilities and libraries.

## Hello World

As a hello world example, I decided to create an offline version of [write-math.com](http://write-math.com/).
[Write-math in eel](https://github.com/MartinThoma/write-math-eel) is on GitHub.

The directory structure of the minimal example is simple:

```plain
.
├── main.py
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── requirements.in
├── requirements.txt
└── web
    └── canvas.html
```

### Standard Stuff

The `README.md` contains some general information and the `Makefile` some
commands which are useful when developing this package.

The `requirements.in` contains the abstract requirements, the
`requirements.txt` contains the requirements pinned with `pip-compile`. You
can install them via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


### main.py

There are three interesting parts to notice:

* `@eel.expose`: Make a Python function available to JavaScript
* `eel.init("web")`: `web` is the web directory
* `eel.start("canvas.html", jinja_templates="templates")`: Start the GUI with
  the `canvas.html` found in the web directory

Simple, isn't it?


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""Start a GUI to classify symbols."""

# Core Library modules
import json
import logging

# Third party modules
import eel
import hwrt
from hwrt import classify

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def get_json_result(results, n=10):
    """Return the top `n` results as a JSON list.
    >>> results = [{'probability': 0.65,
    ...             'whatever': 'bar'},
    ...            {'probability': 0.21,
    ...             'whatever': 'bar'},
    ...            {'probability': 0.05,
    ...             'whatever': 'bar'},]
    >>> get_json_result(results, n=10)
    [{'\\alpha': 0.65}, {'\\propto': 0.25}, {'\\varpropto': 0.0512}]
    """
    s = []
    last = -1
    for res in results[: min(len(results), n)]:
        if res["probability"] < last * 0.5 and res["probability"] < 0.05:
            break
        if res["probability"] < 0.01:
            break
        s.append(res)
        last = res["probability"]
    return json.dumps(s)


@eel.expose
def worker(strokelist):
    """Classify the drawn symbol."""
    results = classify.classify_segmented_recording(json.dumps(strokelist))
    return get_json_result(results, n=10)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    eel.init("web")
    eel.start("canvas.html", jinja_templates="templates")
```

### canvas.html

That one is a bit to long to paste here completely; mainly due to logic of write-math.
The eel parts are simple.

Include `eel.js`. Please note that you don't have to put the file anywhere in
your project.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/eel.js"></script>
```

Use the Python function. Note that `lines` is a global variable I have declared
before. `showResults` is one of my JavaScript functions. The `eel.worker`
refers to the Python function:

```html
async function run() {
    let results = await eel.worker(lines)();
    showResults(results);
}
```

The `results` is a string, so I needed to apply `JSON.parse`.


## Shipping

Probably the most important part. I was not able to create something shippable
directly following the tutorial, so I [added an issue](https://github.com/samuelhwilliams/Eel/issues/298).
Might be a problem on my side, though.

You can still create a Python package and then convert it to a Debian/Ubuntu
package. That should be easy. I have no idea how/if that works for Windows /
Mac.


## Verdict

Eel is a nice package to quickly create GUI prototypes with Python. All the
GUI parts are standard web stuff (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and hence it is super
easy.

Shipping might be a deal breaker if you want to create applications for
non-developers.
