Have you ever heard of polyglots? This is so crazy. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)">polyglot</a> is a program which can be interpreted as many programming languages. You don't believe me that something crazy like that is possible? Here is an example I've made: <a href="https://gist.github.com/MartinThoma/4bc57260c36dea4ce9ce90999f4e81f7">public gist</a>

You can download the file at <a href="../python/polyglot.py">martin-thoma.com/python/polyglot.py</a>.

I used three languages in this piece of code: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)">Whitespace</a>. You can try it with <a href="http://ideone.com/">ideone.com</a>. But please, copy the whole code!

It might be considered as cheating to use comments as often as I did and using two esoteric programming languages. Whitespace works only with whitespaces (space, tab) and Brainfuck needs only +-.;<>[]. Everything else is interpreted as a comment.

When I have much more freetime and I don't know what to do, I'll probably write some code with a more interesting output and which is not that obvious.
