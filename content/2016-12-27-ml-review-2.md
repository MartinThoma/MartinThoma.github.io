This Review gives an overview of intersting stuff I stumbled over which are
related to machine learning. Most of it was posted in <a href="https://ml-ka.de/">KITs machine learning group</a> (on Facebook).

A lot of stuff can be found in my article about <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/nips-2016/">NIPS 2016</a>.


## New Developments

## Live Demos and Websites

### Quickdraw

[Quickdraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) is a program which tries to
guess what you drew. However, it is difficult to check if they really apply
machine learning, because it tells you what to draw and then tries to recognize
it.

<figcaption style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom">I had to draw a piano, a floor lamp, a chandelier, a suitcase, a candle and a lipstick each in under 20 seconds.</figcaption>
</figure>

It looks very much like an attempt to get lots of training data. However, this
plan might not work that well: [Interesting Quickdraw Fails](https://imgur.com/a/hUrOj)

You might find more stuff like Quickdraw on
[aiexperiments.withgoogle.com](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/).


### Loss Functions

[lossfunctions.tumblr.com](http://lossfunctions.tumblr.com/) is a blog created
by [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) where he collects
- well, let's call them "interesting" - loss functions.


### Eyescream

Have you heard about <abbr title="Generative Adversarial Networks">GANs</abbr>?

<a href="http://soumith.ch/eyescream/">Eyescream</a> is a demo for the
generator.


## Publications

<!-- e.g. arXiv -->

### Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled

The input of CNNs for image classification can be manipulated in two ways:

1. An image, on which a human does not recognize anything (e.g. white noise)
   gets a high score for some object class.
2. An image on which a human is certain to recognize one class
   (e.g.&nbsp;"cat")
   is manipulated in a way that the CNN classifies with high certainty something
   different
   (e.g.&nbsp;"factory").

### Breaking Linear Classifiers on ImageNet

Andrej Karpathy has once again written a nice article. The article describes
the problem that [linear classifiers can be broken easily](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/03/30/breaking-convnets/).

Hinton commented something simmilar [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lmo0l/ama_geoffrey_hinton/clyjbai).


### Where am I?

[Google Unveils Neural Network with “Superhuman” Ability to Determine the Location of Almost Any Image](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600889/google-unveils-neural-network-with-superhuman-ability-to-determine-the-location-of-almost/)

One gives the neural network a photo and it tells you where it was taken.


### LIME

["Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) deals with the problem of analyzing black box models decision making process.


### Lip Reading

## Software

<!-- e.g. Theano, Keras, ... -->

### Seaborn

<figure style="display:table;margin: 0 auto 0.55em;">
<a href="{static}/images/2016/11/seaborn_hexbin_marginals.png"><img align="middle"  width="512" src="{static}/images/2016/11/seaborn_hexbin_marginals.png"></a>
<figcaption style="display:table-caption;caption-side:bottom">Example plot generated by Seaborn</figcaption>
</figure>

Seaborn is a Python package for the visualization of data and statistics.

See [stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/).


### RecNet

Jörg made [recnet](https://github.com/joergfranke/recnet) publicly available.
It is a framework based on Theano to simplify the creation of recurrent
networks.


### Image Segmentation Using DIGITS 5

I didn't try it by now, but the images in the article
[Image Segmentation Using DIGITS 5](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/image-segmentation-using-digits-5/) look awesome. I would be happy to hear what
you think about it.


### Keras.js

> Run Keras models (trained using Tensorflow backend) in your browser, with GPU support. Models are created directly from the Keras JSON-format configuration file, using weights serialized directly from the corresponding HDF5 file.

See [github.com/transcranial/keras-js](https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js) for more.
