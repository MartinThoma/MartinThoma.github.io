When different programs or services have to interact, there has to be an
interface to let them do so. A common language, so to say. Commonly, those
interfaces are called APIs - application programming interface.


## Web APIs

I call anything that is not local a web API.

### REST

REST APIs are probably the most widespread type of API. I don't want to
write more in this article about them, because I already wrote <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/rest/">an article about REST</a>.

### GraphQL

In many ways similar to REST, but more flexible.


### RPC

RPC is short for "remote procedure call". There is XML-RPC and JSON-RPC.
XML-RPC is simpler than SOAP.


### SOAP

I'm not sure how wide-spread this still is. I have the impression that this is
mainly (only?) used in the Java world.


## User Interfaces

There are two interesting special cases: Command line interfaces (CLIs) and
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). They are designed for humans, not for
applications. But, of course, you can also use them. Bash scripting is
basically using CLIs all the time.
