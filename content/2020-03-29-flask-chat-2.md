In the first part, we created a chat application with Flask and jQuery which
used polling. In this part, we will have a look at WebSockets (WS).

## Web Sockets Basics

[WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) is a two-way communication protocol.

[WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) is fully usable since 2011.
You can use [WebSocket on all modern Browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=websocket)

It had an [W3C / WHATWG standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html)
and was moved to [IETF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75).

## Scaling

A single server can handle $2^{16} = 65536$ sockets per single IP adress.[^1]
You might want to limit the amount of connections your app makes. Otherwise,
it could happen that you can't ssh your server anymore. For more details, see
[^1],[^2],[^3].
