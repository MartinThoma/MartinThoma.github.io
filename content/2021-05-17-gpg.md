Having full control over encrypted messages is sometimes just nice and crucial
in other situations and/or places in the world. GPG, the Gnu Privacy Guard, is
a commonly used tool to encrypt, decrypt, and sign secrets.

After reading this article, you will know how to use GPG. Let’s go!

## Asymmetric Cryptography: A conceptual overview

Symmetric cryptography is easy to understand. You have two functions, encrypt
and decrypt. Both use a key to generate the output:

```text
encrypt(clear text, key) = cipher text
decrypt(cipher text, key) = clear text
```

The issue with this concept is that you need to exchange the key in a secure way.

Asymmetric cryptography on the other hand makes use of a public/private key pair:

```text
encrypt(clear text, receiver public key) = cipher text
decrypt(cipher text, receiver private key) = clear text
```

An attacker cannot derive the private key from the public key. This means you
can share the public key with everybody. The security of the system does not
rely on the public key. Only the private key needs to stay secret.

If you want to understand how asymmetric cryptography can be used for signing
documents, I recommend reading this article:

[**5 Applications of Digital Signatures**
*Learn what they are and how they are used*](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/5-applications-of-digital-signatures-4e785d22d439)

## Prerequisites

You need to install the command line application GPG, also called GnuPG. Don’t
confuse it with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP in short). The first release of PGP
was in 1991, GPG had its debut in 1999. This means there are over 20 years of
security expertise in GPG.

### Ubuntu

Please note that the leading `$` only indicates that you should enter the
following command into the console. You should not enter $ in the beginning.
All leading/trailing spaces are ignored; they do not matter.

```text
$ sudo apt-get install gpg
```

### Windows

[Download GPG here](https://gnupg.org/download/).

### Mac

```text
$ brew install gnupg
```

## Generate GPG keys

```text
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```

A couple of questions follow. They all suggest reasonable defaults. If you
don’t know what to take, just go with the default.

In the end, you should see a message like this:

```text
pub   rsa4096 2021-05-16 [SC]
      20E4E524CA0B5402260F01EB62EE7851D92F3ECE
uid                      John Smith <[johnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:megaselviana05@gmail.com)>
sub   rsa4096 2021-05-16 [E]
```

You can verify that it worked by listing your keys:

```text
$ gpg --list-keys
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
/home/johnsmith/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-----------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2021-05-16 [SC]
      20E4E524CA0B5402260F01EB62EE7851D92F3ECE
uid           [ultimate] John Smith <[johnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:megaselviana05@gmail.com)>
sub   rsa4096 2021-05-16 [E]
```

The 20E4E524CA0B5402260F01EB62EE7851D92F3ECE is the ID of the keypair. To make
the following simpler, we store it in a variable:

```text
$ export GPGKEY=20E4E524CA0B5402260F01EB62EE7851D92F3ECE
$ echo $GPGKEY
20E4E524CA0B5402260F01EB62EE7851D92F3ECE
```

## Create a Backup!

Losing your private key is a shame. Now you need to share it in a secure
manner with all your contacts again. To prevent it, create a backup.

The Bitcoin community has figured out a way to create a 12-word combination
that generates the seed for generating the key pairs
([BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)).
This is pretty amazing as you can now write down those 12 (up to 24) words and
recreate the key files! GPG is working on this feature
([T169](https://dev.gnupg.org/T169)). Until this is done, you need to store
the private key in a secure way. Maybe two USB sticks that you deposit in
secure locations.

```text
$ gpg -ao my-private.key --export-secret-keys $GPGKEY
```

The file my-private.key looks like this:

```text
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
olGdwDBQAAzBeETABsuGf/ALnExpZDlNpG9kJ4oCfJg+QEDVpMjytNOGGyj/A5h0
...
...
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Share the Public Key

You can share your public key in two ways. ASCII-armored or via key server.

### Share public key via copy-paste

You can directly share an ASCII version of the binary data:

```text
$ gpg --export -a $GPGKEY
```

This will print a long section starting with

```text
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
...
...
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

You can also pipe that block directly into a file:

```text
$ gpg --export -a $GPGKEY > public_key.asc
```

This pure text can easily be shared in a web form, e.g. Github uses this.

### Share public key via key server

```text
$ gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com $GPGKEY
```

Others can then search for a public key via

```text
$ gpg --auto-key-locate keyserver --locate-keys [j](mailto:user@example.net)ohn@smith.com
```

Please note that the keyserver does not validate that the user who generated
the GPG key ever had access to john@smith.com !

## Encrypt a file

```text
$ gpg --output doc.gpg \
      --encrypt \
      --recipient receiver@example.com \
      plain-text.pdf
```

Now you can share doc.gpg and only the holder of the key behind
receiver@example.com will be able to decrypt the message.

⚠️ You need to make sure that the public key you use for receiver@example.com
actually belongs to the person you want to communicate with. This can be done
in person, e.g. at a [key signing
party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party).

## Decrypt a file

```text
$ gpg --output decrypted.pdf \
      --encrypt \
      --recipient receiver@example.com \
      message.txt
```

⚠️ The decrypted file can still be malware. Don’t execute fishy stuff.

## Sign a file

By signing a file, you essentially encrypt it with your private key. This way,
everybody can decrypt it with your public key. And everybody knows that only
you can possibly have encrypted it.

```text
$ gpg --output signed-message.sig --sign message.txt
```

This produces a binary file called signed-message.sig . This is a binary file
that is not readable without using your public key to decrypt and verify it:

```text
$ gpg --output destination.path.txt --decrypt doc.sig
gpg: Signature made So 16 Mai 2021 17:26:56 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key D1E632346B642680EF360D696901E782EF663EC4
gpg: Good signature from "Martin Thoma (Generated on 2021-01-15 for private use) <[info@martin-thoma.de](mailto:info@martin-thoma.de)>" [ultimate]
```

### Clearsign

If you have a text file, you can “clearsign” it. That means the message is
readable in plain text and the signature is in the same file:

```text
$ gpg --clearsing my-special-message.txt
```

It produces the following:

```text
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Dear reader,

This is a simple example message.

Best, Martin

To verify the message.txt.asc, you sadly need two steps:

```text
$ gpg --detach-sign -o sig.gpg message.txt.asc
$ gpg --verify sig.gpg message.txt.asc
gpg: Signature made Mo 17 Mai 2021 23:25:16 CEST

gpg: Good signature from "Martin Thoma (Generated on 2021-01-15 for private use) <[info@martin-thoma.de](mailto:info@martin-thoma.de)>" [ultimate]
```

## Dealing with Breaches: Revocation Certificates

Any system will break eventually. The question is only when it will break and
how you deal with it.

When (and **only then** ⚠️) your private key becomes public, you want to tell
the world that this private key should no longer be used. This is what you use
a revocation certificate for.

```text
$ gpg --output revocation.crt --gen-revoke john.smith@example.com
```

The file looks like this:

```text
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Comment: This is a revocation certificate

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

It can be imported like this:

```text
$ gpg --import revocation.crt
$ gpg --list-keys
...
pub   rsa4096 2021-05-17 [SC] [revoked: 2021-05-17]
      BDEF174F32387BC81C5CBACB48BFEEB144E2F28C
uid           [ revoked] John Smith <[j](mailto:themoosemind@gmail.com)ohn.smith@example.com>
```

And let the keyserver know:

```text
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys $GPGKEY
```

## Limitations

Please be aware that sending GPG-encrypted messages **only hides the contents
of the file**. It does not hide meta-data such as the **message size** or the
**sender/receiver** of the message.

You can obfuscate the size by appending padding text, e.g. something like a
lorem-ipsum text. An attacker could still figure out a maximum message size.

You can obfuscate the receiver by putting the message out in public, e.g. on
your personal website. Or using a public computer to generate a new Gmail
account and exchanging GPG-encrypted messages via those. But then you need to
make sure you’re actually talking to the right person … this problem is hard.

If you exchange messages, you might also want to be able to **repudiate** the
messages: If any part of the conversation went public, you want to be able to
deny that you’re the author. The solution here is simple: Share your private
key. The problem is that you would need to do that regularly.

If you are interested in other security and privacy features you might want to
have, I highly recommend reading “[SoK: Secure
Messaging](https://oaklandsok.github.io/papers/unger2014.pdf)” (IEEE Symposium
on Security and Privacy, 2015) by Unger, Dechand, Bonneau, Fahl, Perl,
Goldberg, and Smith.
