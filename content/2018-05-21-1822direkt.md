Creating a bank account is one of the things you need to do when you're a
longer time in a country, but is incredibly difficult if they don't offer
enough information online - especially, if you don't speak the language.

I had a pretty good experience with N26, let's see how it goes with 1822direkt.


## Registration

Overall, I can say the registration process is super bad.

* **German only**
* It took me 3 tries because the website just decided to push me back to
  the beginning of the 3-step registration process at some point.
* I need to print something, sign it and send it via letter in - that was not
  necessary with N26!
* The printed documents (3 pages) do not contain the adress. It was printed
  really tiny on the last page on the bottom right corner. At least I hope that
  this is the address.
* I need to make POSTIDENT locally - also not necessary with N26.
