This is a guide for building a simple bench for indoor use.

## Final Product

The completed bench will measure 1040mm long, 496mm high, and 456mm deep.
It can support considerable weight when loaded from the top, but has limited resistance to lateral (shear) forces.
This means you can sit on it comfortably, but avoid rocking or shifting your weight sideways.

## Materials

* 19x [2000mm x 48mm x 24mm](https://www.globus-baumarkt.de/p/latte-fichte-tanne-feiner-saegeschnitt-200-cm-48-x-24-mm-saegerau-0780050091/) wooden slats:
    * 10 slats cut into: 1x 1040mm piece + 2x 448mm pieces each
    * 9 slats cut into: 4x 496mm pieces each
* Wood glue
* Wood screws
* Wood stain (optional)

## Tools

* Clamps to hold wood pieces together while glue sets
* Drill for making pilot holes for screws
* Sander (optional)

## Assembly Steps

We will use butt joints to connect the pieces.

1. Sand all wood pieces smooth
2. Apply stain to the pieces that will form the seat surface (this will be more difficult to do after assembly)
3. Apply glue and assemble the pieces. Use clamps to hold them together firmly. Use a square to ensure all angles are 90Â° and that the sides are flush. I also used screws to reinforce the glue joints for added strength.
4. Apply stain to the remaining surfaces of the bench
