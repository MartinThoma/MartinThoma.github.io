This is a guide how to make a nice bench for usage inside.

## Final Product

The bench will be 1040mm long, 496mm high, and 456mm deep.
It can sustain quite a lot of weight from the top, but not so much sheer force.
That means you can sit on it, but please don't wiggle on it.

## Material

* 19x [2000mm x 48mm x 24mm](https://www.globus-baumarkt.de/p/latte-fichte-tanne-feiner-saegeschnitt-200-cm-48-x-24-mm-saegerau-0780050091/) wooden slat:
    * 10x cut into 1x1040mm + 2x448mm
    * 9x cut into 4x496mm
* Wood glue
* Wood screws
* Wood stain (optional)

## Tools

* Clamps to press the wood together
* Drill to make holes for the screws
* Sander (optional)

## Steps

We will use a butt joint to connect the pieces.

1. Sand the wood
2. Stain the parts you will sit on (as this will be harder later)
3. Glue them together. Use clamps to press them together. Ensure with a square
   that the angles are 90Â° and the sides are flush. I've also used screws to
   ensure that the glue is not the only thing holding the wood together.
4. Stain the rest of the bench
