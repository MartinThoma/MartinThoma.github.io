A [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) is a
technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with
first-class functions.


## Pairs

This post is triggered by [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/52481607/562769)
and the nice answer by Martijn Pieters.

Here is a super short example:

```
def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair


def car(pair):
    def return_first(x, y):
        return x
    return pair(return_first)


def cdr(pair):
    def return_last(a, b):
        return b
    return pair(return_last)


cons_return = cons(42, 1337)
print(cons_return)
print(car(cons_return))
print(cdr(cons_return))

```

What is the output of the 3 print statements? Why?

As there are not too many possible answers, you can easily guess it. But can
you explain it?

Explanation:

1. `pair` is a function, hence `cons` returns a function. Note that it
   returns the function, not the return value of the function. So the first
   output is something like `<function cons.<locals>.pair at 0x7f63aa5fa840>`.
2. Once `pair` is called, `a` and `b` are set in this name space. Hence
   `cons` can return different functions!
3. `car` and `cdr` are basically the same, so let's just focus on `car`.
4. `car` has a function as its parameter. It calls this function and gives
   it a function that wants two parameters. This parameter function just
   returns its first argument.
5. Once `car` is called, the new function `pair` is called with the local
   context of `cons`. Then `return_first` is called within that context.


Once you print some intermediate results you get a better understanding:

```
def cons(a, b):
    print('cons called with a={}, b={}'.format(a, b))
    def pair(f):
        print('pair called with a={}, b={}, f={}'.format(a, b, f))
        return f(a, b)
    return pair


def car(pair):
    print('car called with pair={} (a, b are undefined)'.format(pair))
    def return_first(x, y):
        print('return_first called with x={}, y={}'.format(x, y))
        return x
    return pair(return_first)


def cdr(pair):
    def return_last(a, b):
        return b
    return pair(return_last)


cons_return = cons(42, 1337)
print(cons_return)
print()
print(car(cons_return))
```

gives

```
cons called with a=42, b=1337
<function cons.<locals>.pair at 0x7fbb5fe7c840>

car called with pair=<function cons.<locals>.pair at 0x7fbb5fe7c840> (a, b are undefined)
pair called with a=42, b=1337, f=<function car.<locals>.return_first at 0x7fbb5fe7c8c8>
return_first called with x=42, y=1337
42
```

I don't know about you, but this really gives me headaches. I'm don't know why,
but closures are super popular in JavaScript.

Let's see the one example I know they are super useful for.


## partial

Pythons [`functools.partial`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial)
can be used to create simpler functions where some of the arguments are already
filled.

It's implementation is roughly:

```
def partial(func, *args, **keywords):
    def newfunc(*fargs, **fkeywords):
        newkeywords = keywords.copy()
        newkeywords.update(fkeywords)
        return func(*args, *fargs, **newkeywords)
    newfunc.func = func
    newfunc.args = args
    newfunc.keywords = keywords
    return newfunc
```

And you can use it like this:

```
from functools import partial


def power(base, exponent):
    return base**exponent

basetwo = partial(power, base=2)
print(basetwo(exponent=10))  # prints 1024
```

Please note that the call `basetwo(10)` gives the error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/moose/foobar.py", line 8, in <module>
    print(basetwo(10))  # prints 1024
TypeError: power() got multiple values for argument 'base'
```

as you supply power both as a keyword-argument and as a position-based
argument.
