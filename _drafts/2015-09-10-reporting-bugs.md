Reporting bugs seems to be a problem for a lot of users and some developers.
Most people seem only to be able to say "it is not working" (example [1](http://stackoverflow.com/q/32494981/562769), but I've seen this VERY often on StackOverflow).

There are dozens of ways something can "not work":

* Nothing happens at all (e.g. because the code doesn't get executed)
* Something happens, but not what you expected (e.g. because you're / the
  developer is doing it wrong)
* The machine crashes (always / sometimes / often / rarely)
* The program crashes (always / sometimes / often / rarely)

A good bug report should answer the following questions:

1. What did you want to achieve?
2. What did you do (e.g. which input did you give / what did you click in which order)?
3. What happened (e.g. which output did you get)?
4. What did you expect to happen (e.g. which output did you expect to get)?

## Common mistakes

### I've tried everything

Probably not. If the problem is solvable, you haven't tried the correct way.
And you should give a list of what you tried and what happened.
