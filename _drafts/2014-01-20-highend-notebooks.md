My [Acer Travelmate 5744Z](../review-des-acer-travelmate-5744z/)
seems to get broken in soon, so I'm currently looking for a new
notebook. As I use my notebook quite often, I'm would like to have
a high end notebook this time. Some required features are:

* Ubuntu has to be supported completely, especially WLAN, Sound and Bluetooth.
* USB 4.0 port for USB-Stick
* [Bluetooth v4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_Smart_.28v4.0.29)
* At least 4GB of RAM
* At least 80GB of HDD space
* Less than 2.5kg
* At least 15" display size with a resolution of at least 1366x768
* Good Keyboard
* At least 3 hours running time on battery
