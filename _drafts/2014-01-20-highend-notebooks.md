My [Acer Travelmate 5744Z](../review-des-acer-travelmate-5744z/)
seems to get broken in soon, so I'm currently looking for a new
notebook. As I use my notebook quite often, I'm would like to have
a high end notebook this time. Some required features are:

* Ubuntu has to be supported completely, especially WLAN, Sound and Bluetooth.
* USB 4.0 port for USB-Stick
* [Bluetooth v4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_Smart_.28v4.0.29)
* At least 4GB of RAM
* At least 80GB of HDD space
* Less than 2.5kg
* At least 15" display size with a resolution of at least 1366x768
* Good Keyboard
* At least 3 hours running time on battery
* It has to be silent

### Samsung Serie 9 ###

The next few lines show the difference of the `900X4C A0A` to...

* `900X3D-A02`: Seems to be the same as
   Samsung ATIV Book 9. [Intel Core i5-3337U](http://ark.intel.com/products/72055),
   4 GB DDR3-RAM 1333MHz, 128 GB SSD. Costs 948.36 Euro.
* `900X4C-A05`: Intel Core i5 3317U, 128GB SSD, not 2x2 WLAN, ca 1200 Euro
* `900X4C A09`: Costs 1999 Euro (any other difference?)
* `900X4D A03` has also 15" Display, but only 4GB RAM and a
   [Intel Core i5-3317U](http://ark.intel.com/products/65707) and a
   128 GB SSD. But it
   costs only 799 Euro.

* All `X3A` seem to have 13.3" displays.

## Notebooks that did not meet the criteria ##

Display is too small:

* Chromebook Pixel has only 12.85"
* XPS 13 has only 13.3"
* Asus Zenbook has only 13.3"
