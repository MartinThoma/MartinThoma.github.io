C++ is amazingly fast. I took part in Google Code Jam - <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/google-code-jam-2012-round-1a-2012/" title="Google Code Jam 2012 â€“ Round 1A 2012">Round 1A 2012</a> and solved one problem with Python. It took 30 mintues and 4.479 seconds for the large input set!

The same algorithm took only 33 seconds with C++! I compile C++ with O3 compiler optimization:
{% highlight bash %}g++ -Wall -O3 Passwords.cpp -o Passwords.out{% endhighlight %}

If I compile the same program with O0 it takes 1 minutes and 15 seconds.
