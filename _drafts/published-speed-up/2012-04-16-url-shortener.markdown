excerpt: ! "URL shortening services are Websites, which offer redirections from one
  of their pages with short URLs to your page (with a long URL). URL shortening services
  are great when you need to print URLs. I don't like them on Websites / in Emails
  as I can't see the target, but I don't want to type so much when I get a URL in
  my real live.\r\n\r\nThese services should be used more often in my university.
  It's ridiculous that all students have to note very long URLs in the first few days.
  It's not a real problem, but using URL shorteners would be better.\r\n\r\nI'll describe
  some services in the following article."

URL shortening services are Websites, which offer redirections from one of their pages with short URLs to your page (with a long URL). URL shortening services are great when you need to print URLs. I don't like them on Websites / in Emails as I can't see the target, but I don't want to type so much when I get a URL in my real live.

These services should be used more often in my university. It's ridiculous that all students have to note very long URLs in the first few days. It's not a real problem, but using URL shorteners would be better.

I'll describe some services in the following article.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-22501"></a>
