Some friends wondered why I prefer Linux over Windows. As I am currently using only Windows, I can make some examples.

Here is an open list, why I prefer Linux over Windows:

<h2>No marketing strategies</h2>
Windows 7 comes in may flavours: Windows 7 Home, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Professional, ... (see <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/microsoft-product-flavor-hell/">Microsoft product flavor hell</a>)

I have to admit that the choice of Linux can be difficult, too. You can choose from different distributions like Ubuntu, Suse, Fedora, ... (see <a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">distrowatch.com</a>) and some distributions offer different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_Window_System_desktop_environments">desktop environments</a> like GNOME and KDE. The important difference is that Linux flavors depend on your needs, but Windows flavors depend on your money.

<h2>User-friendly system</h2>
As a Ubuntu 10.04 LTS user, I think that Ubuntu is much more user friendly than Windows 7. You have much more control about your system than you have on Windows (see <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/why-are-microsoft-products-so-user-unfriendly/">Why are Microsoft products so User unfriendly?</a>)

Here are some everyday examples:
<ul>
  <li>Chaning the sound volume on a Notebook: You will see an indicator in Ubuntu <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/notify-osd-screenshot.png">like this</a>. On Windows, you have to guess or wait until your movie starts</li>
  <li>Taking a screenshot: In Ubuntu, you only have to press "Print Screen". On Windows, you have to know Snipping tool or install some additional software. Additionally, it seems not to be possible to get a the key "Print Screen" as a shortcut for taking screenshots (<a href="http://superuser.com/q/524357/64857">source</a>).</li>
  <li>Different workspaces, pinning a window to "always in foreground" is definitely missing in Windows.</li>
  <li><a href="http://martin-thoma.com/pdf-printing-on-windows-7/">PDF-Printers</a>: oh my god. This is really sad.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Better community</h2>
When I have questions for my system, I can ask them on <a href="http://askubuntu.com/users/10425/moose?tab=questions">askubuntu.com</a>, <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/4784/moose?tab=questions">unix.stackexchange.com</a> or on <a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/">ubuntuusers.de</a>. I usually get friendly answers that help me to fix my problem within a few minutes.

Where do I find answers to Windows questions? I have tried <a href="http://superuser.com/users/64857/moose?tab=questions">superuser.com</a>, but is there anything else?

<h2>Repositories</h2>
When I want to install <code>something</code>on my Ubuntu machine, I simply type:
[bash]sudo apt-get install something[/bash]

When I want to install something on Windows, I have to Google for it. When I find a tool which seems to fit, I have to find out if it is for free or if it's only a trial version. Then I need to find a way to download it and make sure that it's not malware. 

When I want to update all software I have on my linux machine, I type:
[bash]sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade[/bash]
After this command, my system and every single piece of software I have installed is updated. The updates are automatically installed in the background. A restart might be necessary, but until the restart is done the old software is used.

On Windows, I have to:
<ol>
  <li>Click on the start button</li>
  <li>Type "update" in the search bar</li>
  <li>Click on "Search for updates"</li>
  <li>Install all updates</li>
</ol>
A restart might be required. But I can't simply make the restart when I want to. No, on Windows you will get reminded. You can choose the delay (max. 4 hours) of the reminder, but you can't disable it.
And this is only an update for the operating system. You have to look for updates of your software by yourself. For every single piece of software! This is not so easy. How do you find a reliable source of Updates e.g. for Unreal Tournament 2004?

<h2>Reasons to stay with Windows</h2>
Although I don't like Windows 7 for many reasons, I can see some reasons to stay with Windows:
<ul>
  <li>Linux doesn't support your hardware (see <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/check-computer-hardware-for-linux-compatibility/">Check Computer / Hardware for Linux-compatibility</a>)</li>
  <li>Linux doesn't support your software AND no free alternative exists (e.g. Photoshop for professionals)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pseudo reasons for Linux</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
I often hear that people like Linux because of higher security. I don't think that this is a real reason, as I have never heared of any end user having switched because of security reasons. I also don't think that there is a significant difference of the bare systems in security.

<h3>Freedom to change code</h3>
Some people argue, that you can change the code of Linux / OpenSource programs according to your needs. This is only an argument, if you have done it at least once.
