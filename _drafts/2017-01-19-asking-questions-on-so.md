StackOverflow.com and all StackExchange Websites are great for asking questions
and getting short, precise answers in a couple of minutes. But it seems to be
hard for many users to ask good questions.

Try to follow these steps if you ask questions on StackExchange

## Try to find an answer
Asking a question on StackOverflow should not be your first step. Try using
Google, Wikipedia or other pages that might fit.

## Figure out of your question fits to StackExchange
You should try to figure out if your question generally fits to any
StackExchange Website:

<ul>
  <li>Does your question allow one correct answer?
    <ul>
      <li>If you can formulate the question as "How can I ..." your question does very likely fit</li>
      <li>If you have to formulate it as "Is it good/bad ... " or "What is the best ..." it is very unlikely</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Now you have to figure out which of the many StackExchange Websites fits:

* StackOverflow
* SuperUser
* ServerFault

## How to formulate the question
You can write a lot of text in your question and provide a lot of additional
information. But it is most important that you really ask a question. A
question has to have a question mark at the end.

Try to avoid "it", "this", "this problem". Be specific, if it is possible in a short sentence.
