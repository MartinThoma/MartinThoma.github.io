As always, the answer depends on what exactly you expect. Do you want hosting only? Do you need somebody to create your site? Are you able to use a CMS? I'll explain those now:

<h2>URL only</h2>
If you only buy the URL, a domain (something like www.martin-thoma.com, martin-thoma.com, google.com, wikipedia.org or google.de) gets registered for you. You can't buy a URL once and have it for the rest of your life. It's rather like telephone access: The first time, you might have to pay more, because your house has to get connected with telephone cables, but you also have to pay every month for being able to phone.

This "URL only" contract contains a redirect to any URL you want. The price depends on the domain ending (.de or .com or .org) you want.

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Provider</th>
  <th>Price (once)</th>
  <th>Proce (per month)</th>
  <th>Other important information</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="https://knallhart.de/domains/index+JmFydGlkPTI2.html">Knallhart.de</a></td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>0.88 Euro</td>
  <td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="http://www.strato.de/domains/">Strato</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strato_AG">Wiki</a></td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>0.79 Euro</td>
  <td>.de Domains for 0.29 Euro</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="http://www.godaddy.com/domains/search.aspx?isc=gsndde01&ci=8990">godaddy.com</a> - <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Daddy">Wiki</a></td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>0.75 Euro</td>
  <td>-</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>URL and static hosting</h2>
This includes the service above, hosting of some static HTML pages and one FTP-access to upload your stuff. You could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileZilla">FileZilla</a> to upload it via FTP.
Please note that most pages have something dynamic.

What you can do:
<ul>
  <li>Upload Photos</li>
  <li>Use JavaScript (yes, this is dynamic, but it is on the Client)</li>
</ul>

What you can't do:
<ul>
  <li>Use PHP or Python or Perl</li>
  <li>Add a WordPress blog</li>
</ul>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Provider</th>
  <th>Price (once)</th>
  <th>Proce (per month)</th>
  <th>Other important information</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="https://knallhart.de/domains/index+JmFydGlkPTE=.html">Knallhart.de</a></td>
  <td>-</td>
  <td>0.93 Euro</td>
  <td>only .de domains, 10 MB storage</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>URL, static hosting, PHP and MySQL</h2>
Again, this includes all of the above. Additionally, you can execute PHP and you have access to at least one MySQL database.
