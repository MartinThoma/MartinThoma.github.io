I suggest to read / practice the following to get a better developer.

1. Install `git`. Learn the basics (clone, pull, commit, push).
2. Do you know `git blame`?
3. Learn about `git log`, `git shortlog`, `git diff`.
   Try using [`meld` as your diff tool](http://martin-thoma.com/software-versioning-cheat-sheet/#tocAnchor-1-5-2)
4. Learn [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
5. Learn abou `--amend` (see [Edit an incorrect commit message in Git](http://stackoverflow.com/q/179123/562769))
6. Learn about wrong assumptions you probably have: [Doing Terrible Things To Your Code](http://blog.codinghorror.com/doing-terrible-things-to-your-code/)
