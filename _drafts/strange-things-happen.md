<h3>Dresden Files</h3>
I've ordered two books of the series "The Dresden Files": The German version of "Summer Knight" and "Death Masks".

That's what I've got:

So I've called them, they apologized and promised to send me book no. 4.

Three days later, I've got a book of "The Dresden Files": Book no 5!
