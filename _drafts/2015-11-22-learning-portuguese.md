I am currently learning Portuguese. One thing which was new to me is that there
are - just as it's the case with English - variants of Portuguese. There is
Portuguese as it is spoken in Brazil and Portuguese as it is spoken in
Portugal.


## Software Ideas

Several software ideas came to my mind while I was learning Portugues.


### Wiki for languages

Give people the possibility to add words, pronounciation, ...


### Vocabulary Service

Anki is nice for learning vocabulary, but I miss some options:

* Mentioning errors in public decks
* Dependencies: Sometimes it doesn't make sense to learn B, when you don't know
  A really well.

And some options were not simple / good enough:

* Sharing
* Back-ups
* Browsing cards
* "Retiring" decks: Sometimes I know I'll never practice a deck again, but I
  still want to keep it. Just in case.
