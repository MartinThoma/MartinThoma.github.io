## Old year predictions

Machine Learning and Technology

1. *Networks will get deeper. Currently about 8&nbsp;layers is usual; I expect this to get to over 30&nbsp;layers.*<br/>
   [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) has networks with over 1000 layers.
2. First hacks / funny results by people abusing the fact that machine learning is used will appear.<br/>
   [Twitter taught Microsoft’s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist), [/r/howhot](https://www.reddit.com/r/howhot)
3. Machines will generate "high" resolution images of at least 256 &times 256
   pixels.
4. Speech synthesis will fastly improve. To benchmark this, I will use the
   original quotation that explained the importance of towels is found in
   Chapter 3 of Adams' work The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy. See [Towel Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day), [Google Translate Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-google.ogg), [Festival Recording](//martin-thoma.com/audio/2016-01-04-towel-quote-festival.ogg)
5. ALPHABET INC. (C) (GOOGLE) shares at Frankfurt Stock Exchange will go up to
   about 900&nbsp;Euro sometime in the year (currently, it is at 690&nbsp;Euro).
6. [Solar Roadways](http://www.solarroadways.com/) will make some tiny
   advances.

About Me

7. One of my papers will get cited at least 5&nbsp;times.
8. I will spend at least 2&nbsp;weeks abroad.
9. I will publish at leat 40&nbsp;articles on my blog.
10. I will get a 90&nbsp;days streak on GitHub (currently, my longest is
   43&nbsp;days).
11. I will get 15&thinsp;000 points on StackExchange (see [StackExchange profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/271958/moose?tab=accounts))

Politics

12. The [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) will
    still exist and Britain will still be part of it
    (see [Brexit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)).
13. Donald Trump will be the republican candidate and Hillary Clinton the
    democrat candidate.
14. The republican candidate will get president.
15. More mass shootings in the US and terrorist attacks all over the world will
    happen.
16. Grüne and SPD will still be in Baden-Württemberg (see [Landtagswahl in Baden-Württemberg 2016](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landtagswahl_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_2016)).
