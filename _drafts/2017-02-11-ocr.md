OCR (optical character recognition) is the conversation of an image which
contains text into machine readable text. In form of data formats, you put a
JPG in and you receive a txt or a PDF (which contains text, not just the
image).

The reason why OCR is important, is that it makes images searchable. For
example, I have a lot of handwritten notes which I want to digitalize. So I
will scan those notes. But when I want to find anything in them, I will search
for parts of the content (e.g. "statistik"). Also, if OCR works really well
it could help you to read documents. Especially if you have notes from people
like me with an aweful handwriting.

For the rest of this article, please keep in mind that I didn't write an OCR
software so far.

I tried a couple of OCR programs / [asked for good & gratis OCR software](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/39397/ocr-software-for-linux). Seems as if this is
not solved.


## How it can work

Here is a very simple approach how OCR could work:

1. **Segmentation**: First try to isolate blocks of text. Then try to find
   lines. Then try to segment single characters.
2. **Classification**: Given the segments, find what symbol is in them.
3. **Placement**: Find the relationship between two classified symbols (is one
   to the right of the other or rather the the right-top? Hence: Is it $ax$ or
   $a^x$?


### Segmentation

You could make the image a binary (white-black) image. One way would be to
convert it to grayscale, then apply a threshold. This will, of course, only
work well for "standard" text (black letters on white paper).

Now you have the binary image in which mainly the text should be black and the
rest is white. To crop text blocks from the image, I would make a histogram of
black pixels over the x-axis. By that, you can remove the parts where
significantly less black pixels are (e.g. border, separate columns). Then do
the same thing for the y-axis (e.g. border, paragraphs).

As soon as you have blocks of text, you want single lines. I guess this works
with the histogram apporach as well.


## Why it's hard

1. Everybody has a unique handwriting.
2. There are different alphabets in the world. Much more than what you have in
   English.
3. Even the same alphabet has a lot of variance between countries. For example,
   The digit `1` is often written as a single line in the US. But in Germany,
   we use two lines (more similar to the printed version of `1`). Some people
   even make 3 lines.
4. Overlapping characters (especially in cursive handwriting)
5. Really weird placement (especially in mathematics)
6. Tables within the handwriting
7. Images within the handwriting

I think the hierarchy of different levels of difficulty of OCR is:

1. Printed text, no math, no tables, no images, English, scanned
2. Printed text, no math, no tables, no images, English, photographed with the intention to create a readable document
3. Printed text, no math, no tables, no images, Few-symbol languages with lots of digital content, scanned
4. Printed text, no math, no tables, no images, Many-symbol languages with lots of digital content, scanned
5. Printed text, no math, no tables, images, English, scanned
6. Printed text, no math, tables, no images, English, scanned
7. Printed text, math, no tables, no images, English, scanned
8. Handwritten block text, no math, no tables, no images, English, scanned
9. Handwritten cursive text, no math, no tables, no images, English, scanned
10. Handwritten block text, math, no tables, no images, English, scanned

## Datasets

I am currently looking for datasets (see [question on opendata.stackexchange.com](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/q/10626/5487)). I'm thinking about publishing my
notes as an unlabeled dataset.


## A benchmark page

Lets take [this image](//martin-thoma.com/images/2017/02/scan-thoma-1-1-statistik.jpg)
as a benchmark. It is written in German, with mainly mathematical content.

Several things to note here:

* I had to tell it that the document is written in German
* The recognition of the handwritten part did not work at all
* The recognition of the printed part was perfect, except that the placement is
  wrong
* Trailing whitespaces 🙈

Things to note here:

* I had to tell it that the document is written in German
* It supports multiple languages in the same document 🙂
* I removed a lot of empty lines in between
* The recognition of the handwritten part did not work at all.
* The recognition of the printed part was pretty good, but not perfect.
* The placement worked for the printed part
* Trailing whitespaces 🙈
