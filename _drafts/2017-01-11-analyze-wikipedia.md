Wikipedia is one of the most outstanding achievements of mankind. A free source of knowledge that everybody can access and contribute to, without any other purpose than sharing knowledge. It offers understandable articles to difficult topics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">mathematical groups</a>, some amazing ones like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature">Patterns in nature</a>" or topics that might be of political interest like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">global warming</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vukovar">Battle of Vukovar</a>.
It even has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spoken_articles">spoken articles</a>.

<h2>Without Programming</h2>
Wikipedia offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools">a lot of tools</a> to do common tasks. I would like to give you an impression how some of them can be used.

<h3>Category Intersection</h3>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Category_intersection">Category Intersections</a> offer a very basic tool to get a little bit more out of Wikipedia. For example, I wanted to link to good articles in the first sentences. I knew that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles">featured articles</a> existed and I know that most people think mathematics is complicated. So I let <a href="http://toolserver.org/~magnus/catscan_rewrite.php">catscan_rewrite</a> search through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Featured_articles">Category:Featured articles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics">Category:Mathematics</a>.

<h2>With Programming</h2>
Did you know that you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download">download Wikipedia</a>? You can get a dump of Wikipedia databases (→ <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html">index page with all dumps</a>). I would like to analyse the english wiki so I've downloaded it (→ <a href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20121101/">english dump</a>).
