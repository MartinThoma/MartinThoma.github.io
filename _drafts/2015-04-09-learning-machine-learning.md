There is plenty of material online for learning machine learning. I like to
share some links in this post to what I know. Feel free to add comments with
other material.

## Stanford: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

> Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies
> of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a
> crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere
> because people communicate most everything in language: web search,
> advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology
> reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine
> learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches
> have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These
> models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require
> traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course
> students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their
> own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into
> cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP. The final project will
> involve training a complex recurrent neural network and applying it to a
> large scale NLP problem. On the model side we will cover word vector
> representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
> long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional
> neural networks as well as some very novel models involving a memory
> component. Through lectures and programming assignments students will learn
> the necessary engineering tricks for making neural networks work on practical
> problems.

They provide YouTube videos and slides. The videos are simply recordings of
the lecture, but in good quality.

## Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning

> Machine Learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data
> analysis today. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to
> process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward
> ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions.
>
>Machine learning brings together computer science and statistics to harness
>that predictive power. It’s a must-have skill for all aspiring data analysts
>and data scientists, or anyone else who wants to wrestle all that raw data
>into refined trends and predictions.
>
>This is a class that will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating
>data through a machine learning lens. It will teach you how to extract and
>identify useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most
>important machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of
>your machine learning algorithms.
