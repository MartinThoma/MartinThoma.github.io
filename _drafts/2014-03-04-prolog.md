Prolog is a logic programming language.

Any prolog program consists of

* declaration of facts (also called objects)
* rules about objects and their relationship
* asking "questions" about objects and their relationship

## First steps
At first you have to install `swi-prolog`. After installing it, you can call it
with `swipl`.

When you've started `swipl` you can import your myscript.pl files by `consult(myscript).`.
Don't forget the point at the end. It is important and somehow like the 
`;` in C.

## Defining facts
The definition of facts can look like this:

```prolog
loves(john,X).
```

* Note that names of all relationships and all objects have to begin with a lower
case letter. Variables begin with a captial letter.
* The relationship is written first (`john`). The objects are separated by `,` 
  and everything is finished with `.`.
* The example from above means: `john` loves everything.
* You can have any number of arguments.
* The ordering of arguments is important (`loves(john,X)` is not the same as `loves(X,john)`).

### Symbols

| boolean | Prolog |
|---------|--------|
| and     | `,`    |
| or      | `;`    |
| if      | `:-`   |
| not     | `not`  |

* An underscore `_` is an anonymous variable.

## Rules

Rules consist of a head and a body. They are separated by `:-`.

## Questions

```prolog
?own(mary,book)
```

This will invoke the prolog unifier. So Prolog will check if the fact 
`own(mary,book)` can be derived from the knowen facts. Important is that it
starts with `?`. Everything else in questions is just like it was for facts.
