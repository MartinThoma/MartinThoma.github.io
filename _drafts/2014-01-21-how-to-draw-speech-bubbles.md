The following article describes how to draw speech bubbles like this:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="Speech bubbles" text="Speech bubbles" url="/images/2013/11/WER-calculation.png" %}

The nice icon is from [Wikipedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_personal.png)
and part of the Crystal Clear project by Everaldo Coelho.

## Preparation ##
1. Install `inkscape`.
2. Get an image where you want to put the speech bubble.
3. Add text with <kbd>F2</kbd>

Now it should looke like this:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="512" alt="Speech bubbles" text="Preparation" url="../images/2014/01/inkscape-speech-bubble-step-1.png" %}

## Rectangle ##
Now you have to put a rectangle (<kbd>F2</kbd>) or an ellipses (<kbd>F5</kbd>)
around your text. The rectangle should be placed below the text
(<kbd>Page down</kbd>).

To make positioning easier, group the text and the surrounding box:

1. Mark box by clicking on it
2. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Click on the text
3. Group with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>

Now it should looke like this:
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="512" alt="Speech bubbles" text="Preparation" url="../images/2014/01/inkscape-speech-bubble-step-2.png" %}

## Indicator ##
To add the "indicator" that shows who spoke, press <kbd>Shift</kbd>
+ <kbd>F6</kbd> and add a triangle that overlaps with the box:
{% caption align="aligncenter" width="512" alt="Speech bubbles" text="Preparation" url="../images/2014/01/inkscape-speech-bubble-step-3.png" %}

Then press <kbd>F2</kbd> to modify the path by nodes. Add some controll
nodes in between by double-clicking on the path in between:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="512" alt="Speech bubbles" text="Preparation" url="../images/2014/01/inkscape-speech-bubble-step-4.png" %}

Then delete them. Now you have those round curves that can be manipulated
with the little circles:
