Next week it's time again: Daylight saving time. One hour gets stolen from us.

John Oliver sums it up pretty well:

## Short Facts

* In 1907 [William Willett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Willett) had
  the idea to save energy cost of street lightning by introducing DST
* DST was introduced in 1916 in the German Reich
* Beginning from 1977, most European countries used DST. This was probably
  caused by the [1973 oil crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis).
* Beginning from 1994, all countries in the EU get the same rules for DST.
