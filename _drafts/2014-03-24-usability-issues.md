> Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.

## Google Plus

It seems as if Google doesn't want me to read long comments:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="Google+ allows me to +1 a comment in collapsed mode" text="Google+ allows me to +1 a comment in collapsed mode" url="../images/2014/03/google-plus-plus-exits.png" %}

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="But I can't +1 when I can read the complete comment." text="But I can't +1 when I can read the complete comment." url="../images/2014/03/google-plus-no-plus.png" %}

## YouTube

YouTube offers no way to dismiss recommendet videos:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="YouTube recommended videos - a 'dismiss' function is missing" text="YouTube recommended videos - a 'dismiss' function is missing" url="../images/2014/03/youtube-no-dismiss.png" %}

Although amazon does also not have a 'block this item' function, it helps you to
understand (and eventually fix) the problem why you get undesired recommendations:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="Amazon recommendations" text="Amazon recommendations" url="../images/2014/03/amazon-recommendation.png" %}
