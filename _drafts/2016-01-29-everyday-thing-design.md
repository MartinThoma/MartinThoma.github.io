Here are a couple of things I've noticed about which one should think, when it
is designed.


## Shower

* Have a place where people can put the shampoo. It should not fall down and
  this thing should at the same time be easy to clean.
* When there are multiple showers in one room, PLEASE make everybody have their
  own drain. It can be really disgusting to share a drain with a stranger...
  I had a bad experience on a camping place in Scotland...
* The shower should have a place where you can put your cloth and where you can
  put the towel. Preferably placed in a way that you don't have to make the
  whole bath wet.
* Make it absolutely clear how to get more water (the pressure) and how to
  change the temperature. I prefer one control element for temperature and one
  for pressure. Also, make it clear where it is increased and where it is
  decreased.


## Sink

* Make the valve (instrument?) be in the sink. So when you just cleaned your
  hands and they are still wet you don't make the rest of the bath wet.


## Doors

Doors should be desinged in a way that it is obvious in which way they are to
open. They should not require a sign. For example, if you have to push it, it
should only have a flat surface.
