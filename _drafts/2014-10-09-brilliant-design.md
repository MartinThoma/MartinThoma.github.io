The design of products is enourmously important for its usefullnes. A good
product design leads to users that use the product in the right way without
having to read manuals. Or the behave in the right way.

In the following, I will show you some examples for nice product design.

## Traffic Lights

Pedestrians often choose to ignore traffic lights because it just takes too
long. The design company relogik has developed a nice solution to help people
to be patient: Show them how long it will take until it gets green.
(I think the design is for cars, but I don't know any car driver who ignores
a red light. So I think one could adapt it for pedestrians.)

## Mugs

Sometimes you get coffee stains because a little drop of the coffee (or tea)
drops down at the side of the mug. The following design by "Yanko Design"
prevents that:

## Medicine

I remember that I've seen a Ted Talk about the design of package inserts of
drugs. I can't find it any more ðŸ˜•.

## Brush

## Floor plans

* Having the plan right at the entrance of the building
* A big red dot which indicates the current position. Nothing else should be
  red. Below the dot, there should be a text "you are here".
* If the building has multiple floors, all floorplans should be right at the
  entrance. An alphabetically sorted index of rooms should point to the floor
  in which that room is.
* Rooms should have a common naming scheme. For example, `XYY` where X is the
  floor number and `YY` is an increasing number. `123` should be right below
  `223` and `123` should be followed by `124`. If The building is very big,
  one could try to encode North, East, South and West in the Room number.

## Simpler stuff

* Over-Ear headphones: Removable cables so that if the cable breaks, you don't
  have to throw the whole phone away.
* Standardised loading cables: One charger to rule them all.

## Computer Stuff

### Websites

There is way to much about good design (not graphics, but structure) to say
in the context of websites.

* Search boxes
* Ordering systems like categories, tags, ...
* Navigation systems like breadcrumbs, index pages, ...
