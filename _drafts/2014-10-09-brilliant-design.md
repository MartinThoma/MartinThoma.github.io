The design of products is enourmously important for its usefullnes. A good
product design leads to users that use the product in the right way without
having to read manuals. Or the behave in the right way.

In the following, I will show you some examples for nice product design.

## Traffic Lights

Pedestrians often choose to ignore traffic lights because it just takes too
long. The design company relogik has developed a nice solution to help people
to be patient: Show them how long it will take until it gets green.
(I think the design is for cars, but I don't know any car driver who ignores
a red light. So I think one could adapt it for pedestrians.)

## Mugs

Sometimes you get coffee stains because a little drop of the coffee (or tea)
drops down at the side of the mug. The following design by "Yanko Design"
prevents that:
