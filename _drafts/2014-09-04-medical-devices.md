I have recently seen a TED talk of Talithia Williams, a statistician who talked
about data in medicine. She made the point that is important for people to have
as much of their own body data, collected over longer periods of time, as
possible:

I think the idea is very good. But I can see at least 3 different ways how
people might get that data:

1. By **wearable devices**: The monitoring electronics could be weaved into your
   shirts, sending data wireless to your smartphone. That way, you could get
   lots of data over a long period of time
2. By **dedicated personal devices**: Some illnesses / bad health conditions
   might not be detectable without a dedicated device. But this group of
   devices has to be affordable. I'm not sure what that exactly means in terms
   of Euros, but certainly less than 500 Euros. Eventually at most 80 Euro.
3. By **dedicated public devices**: Today, every expensive medical device seems
   to be owned by universities or hospitals. Although I think that might be
   reasonable, I think it's bad that you can't get your data that easy.

The second category is even part of an X Prize. It is called
[Tricorder X PRIZE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder_X_PRIZE).
