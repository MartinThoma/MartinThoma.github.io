I have recently seen a TED talk of Talithia Williams, a statistician who talked
about data in medicine. She made the point that is important for people to have
as much of their own body data, collected over longer periods of time, as
possible:

I think the idea is very good. But I can see at least 3 different ways how
people might get that data:

1. By **wearable devices**: The monitoring electronics could be weaved into your
   shirts, sending data wireless to your smartphone. That way, you could get
   lots of data over a long period of time
2. By **dedicated personal devices**: Some illnesses / bad health conditions
   might not be detectable without a dedicated device. But this group of
   devices has to be affordable. I'm not sure what that exactly means in terms
   of Euros, but certainly less than 500 Euros. Eventually at most 80 Euro.
3. By **dedicated public devices**: Today, every expensive medical device seems
   to be owned by universities or hospitals. Although I think that might be
   reasonable, I think it's bad that you can't get your data that easy.

The second category is even part of an X Prize. It is called
[Tricorder X PRIZE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder_X_PRIZE).

## Wearables

### Smart Shirts

OMsignal sells a shirt for 200 USD. It measures heart and breathing data as well
as activity data.

### Shoes

I have heard about shoes that contain chips. Most applications seem to be
quite boring, though. Only tracking of motion / GPS. I could imagine that
you also track how a person walks. Also, shoes could contain more heavy
parts for other devices.


### Wristbands

The [Jawbone UP24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawbone_(company)#UP24_design)
is a wristband.

* Device:
  * The "outer hull" is made out of rubber. It is water and sweat resistant.
  * It weights about 22g.
  * Only works with iOS.
* Connectivity
  * Bluetooth
* Battery:
  * It has to be charged every 7 days.
  * A full charge takes about 1h 20m
* Costs 149 USD

The source of my information is the following video:

Other wristbands are:

### Google Contact Lense

[Google Contact Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Contact_Lens) is a
smart contact lens project announced by Google on 16 January 2014. The project
aims to assist people with diabetes by constantly measuring the glucose levels
in their tears.

## Tricoders

Tricoders are small devices that can measure some of your data.

### Medical Thermometer

[Medical theromemters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_thermometer)
might be the oldest wide-spread medical instrument that is still in use.
You insert them to your mouth or your butt and it measures your body
temperature.

The price is around 3 - 35 Euro.

### Weight Scale

Weight scales are widespread, but they are typically not conceived as a medical
instrument. The reason is probably because you might need more data to get
useful information than only a single weight.

Modern weight scales like the Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer measure

* body weight
* body fat
* heart frequency
* air quality

The Withings WS-50 connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It costs 150 Euro.

### Blood Sugar

### Blood pressure / heard rate

### Scanadu Scout

<iframe width="512" height="288" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rKCeoiRhVuI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> The Scanadu Scout is a scanner packed with sensors designed to read your vital signs and send them wirelessly to your smartphone in a few seconds, any time, anywhere.

The [Scanadu Scout Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scanadu-scout)
ended on 20.07.2013. They raised 1.6 million USD.

[Scanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanadu) is a Silicon Valley-based company that makes medical technology devices for consumers.

The scout measures:

* heart rate and ECG
* blood pressure
* temperature
* respiratory rate
* oximetry

The "First Responders" perk costed 199 USD.

## Wired Furniture

Wired furniture is a group of devices that you have anyway, but that are
enhanced with sensors

### Toilets
