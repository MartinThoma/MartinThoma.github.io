It's new years eve and - as always - I try to finish some things and have some
plans for next year.


## Achievements of 2015

* I've got 10,000 points on StackOverflow and reached 2.5 million people with
  my questions and answers ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/users/562769/moose))
* I've got the funding by the [Begabtenstiftung](http://www.begabtenstiftung-informatik.de/)
  to go with my friend Marvin to Berkeley. Let's see if Berkeley accepts us.
* I've published 4&nbsp;papers on arXiv
  ([link](http://arxiv.org/a/thoma_m_1.html)) and started building an academic
  profile with [orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-1690).
  I'm not sure how important that will be, though.


## Finishing Things

I always do some cleanup before the new year begins. This means especially
cleaning my computer stuff of unnecessary trash.

### E-Mail

Finding and deleting old unnecessary emails:

* StackExchange: do-not-reply@stackexchange.com
* University
  * physik-l@lists.kit.edu
  * physik-ll@lists.kit.edu
  * stipendiaten@lists.does-not-exist.org
  * ilias@scc-ilias-03.scc.kit.edu
* Programming
  * notifications@travis-ci.org
  * noreply@coursera.org
* Other
  * offener-haushalt-request@lists.okfn.org
  * jobs-listings@linkedin.com
  * messages-noreply@linkedin.com
  * mailing@abgeordnetenwatch.de
  * infoen@bondora.com
  * notify@twitter.com
  * noreply@indiegogo.com

This were sever hundret emails.

The next step is going through "marked emails".


### Desktop and Downloads

Clean those folders up


### Updating

### Blog articles

## Plans

I want to get the following things done in 2016:

* [ ] Quit church: That one is actually more complicated in Germany than it
  should be. I have to get to the civil registry office, get a **personal**
  date, **pay 31.50 Euro**
  (Source: [karlsruhe.de](https://web1.karlsruhe.de/service/d115/detail.php?prod_id=463))
* [ ] Migrate from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/)
* [ ] Get all my stuff from my fathers apartment to my room. I've already
      packed most of it in boxes (In total: 1.30m (+0.30m?) × 0.39m × 0.60m by 7 boxes)
* [ ] Get rid of my old bed
* [ ] Get rid of my old vacuum cleaner
* [ ] Paint the wall
* [ ] Contact BSI
