I'm currently analyzing data from [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/)
which is an on-line reference for bibliographic information on major
computer science publications. They offer the [whole data set](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/)
(about 2GB!) as XML files.

XML files are nice for data export, but not so nice when you want
to look at them. So I would like to import the data into MySQL.
When the data is in a MySQL database, I can use phpMyAdmin to view
the data.

[Yiyu Jia's technical Blog](http://yiyujia.blogspot.de/2010/09/convert-dblpxml-format-to-relational-db.html)
describes a manual way of converting the data from XML to MySQL. But
as there is `dblp.dtd`, I hoped there would be tools that automatically
generated a MySQL (or SQLite) database from that.

Another approach was using [dblp++](http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php)
which is given as a MySQL gzipped dump. But this is probably not the
most recent data and it was modified. Although importing it with
`gunzip < dblp-2013-12-21.sql.gz | mysql -h localhost -u root --password=myPass dblp`
is easy, the data itself is not what I wanted.
