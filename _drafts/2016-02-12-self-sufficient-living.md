I was recently thinking about self-sufficient living. Not that I plan to do so,
but just wondering what it would need for a person who wants to skip out of
the society and live on their own for about 40 years.

I think there are a couple of main ideas:

* One-time things
* Heating
* Electricity
* Food
* Water
* Hygiene stuff
* Health
* Communication


## One-time things

One-time things is just stuff which you would need to get once. You would
- of course - have to take care of them and probably be able to replace them,
but assuming a "natural" length of live-time you will probably be good with
getting them once.

For example, land to live on would be one. A house to live in. More difficult
might be animals, kitchen stuff.

I guess sophisticated 3D printers might come in very handy, if you can make the
granulate for them yourself.


## Heating

Heating is a solved problem. There are [passive houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house)
which have such a good insulation that your body heat / heat of electrical
devices is enough. At least for German temperatures. I'm not too sure how this
would work in [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia).

Also, you can very easily build a device which heats quite a bit with sun
power. For example, you could use that to heat up the water.

I've heard that with Vakuum-Superisolation (VSI) / vulcan


## Electricity

Electricity is tricky. While there are **solar cells**, small **wind
turbines**, the possibility to just burn fuel you are either not completely
self-sustaining or you might have times when you don't have enough electricity
to power all your stuff. For me, I would use most electricity when I would use
both of my computers for some heavy machine learning task, have several lights
on, use my speakers to watch movies while I have the washing machine running,
the fridge and something on the stove as well as in the oven.

Another possibility for slightly larger groups of people might be
[geothermal electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_electricity).
However, I am not sure how much engery the smallest geothermal power plants
support, how realiable they are, how much knowledge is needed to keep them
running and how much they cost.

There are alternatives which need less energy or even no engery at all. Or at
least need energy when it is available:

* Energy efficient devices (fridge, washing machine, computer, LED lamps)
* Cooking something where you need the oven / stove might be done for lunch.
  While the sun is up, you could use it to heat your stuff. However, I'm not
  too sure if this can really be done in a modern kitchen without making it
  feel like a camping trip.
* Washing can be done without electricity!
  [Drumi by Yirego](http://www.yirego.com/) proves it. However, you have to
  do it "by hand" (stay with it while it works / use your mussle power to
  use it)
* [Gravity Light](http://gravitylight.org/) is a possiblity to have light
  to read.


## Food

A henn (chicken) seems to lay about 0.75 eggs a day! That is much more than
I expected. And they only cost about 10&nbsp;-&nbsp;15&nbsp;Euro. They lay eggs
for about 5&nbsp;-&nbsp;7&nbsp;years.

A cow gives about 8&nbsp;kg of milk per day. They cost about 1500&nbsp;Euro and
live for about 20&nbsp;years.

You can grow a lot of food very simple on your own. However, this depends
very much on where you live. Just to give you a couple of ideas:

* Tomatoes,
* cucumbers
* pumpkin,
* peppers
* all kinds of berries and strawberries
* nuts
* fruit trees (apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, quince,)

Alternatively, you can grow some stuff inside (e.g. a greehouse, aquaponics,
or a [winter garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_garden)).

Also interesting is the [Flow Hive](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flow-hive-honey-on-tap-directly-from-your-beehive#/) which claims to make getting honey really simple.


## Water

Getting clean water from the sink to shower, cook and drink is so easy that we
tend not to think about it. However, it is an achievement of our modern
society. If you live off-the-grid, you'll better make sure to think about this
before. Even rain might not be clean enough to savely drink. I don't even speak
about rivers.

Having your own well would be one option for drinking and cooking. Having a
rain reservoir might be an option for the toilet and probably also for the
shower and a washing machine. But what about the dishwasher?


## Hygiene stuff

Tooth paste? Shampoo? Soap? I have no idea if one could make those by ones own.
I guess that would be quite a bit of work and probably be much worse.

Simple things like toilet paper are actually quite difficult to get if you
really want to live off-the-grid ([source](http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/82/2814)).


## Health

I guess for most simple things you can get the knowledge yourself. However,
when you get older you might want to have specialized people easy to reach.
That is not possible, except if you live in a huge group of people so that
even specialists can get enough work to support themselves.


## Communication

Hm. I'm not sure if there is a way to get free communication of-the-grid.
I mean, yes, there is [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio).
But most of the time you have to register for that, too.
