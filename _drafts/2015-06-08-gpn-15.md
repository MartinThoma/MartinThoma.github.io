GPN 15 (short for 'Gulasch Programmiernacht', German for 'goulash programming
night') is now over and I would like to give a short recap of some talks.

My overall impression was that it is more a social event than a "technical
meeting".


## Freifunk

Freifunk is the idea to share WiFi. If you don't need it, why shouldn't you
allow others to use it?

Well … in Germany we have something called
"[Störerhaftung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%B6rerhaftung)". This
means, the person who the internet access belongs to is reponsible if somebody
else does harm with that. This means if a crime is commited via you internet
access, it does not matter if it was you or not. You will be held responsible.

With Freifunk, you get around that. They establish a tunnel to a country where
it is not a problem.

## Stand der Informationsfreiheit in Deutschland

"Informationsfreiheit" means that the government has to make data public. It
is not enough that you can ask for it and get it; they have to make it public
in the first place (if nothing like privace forbids it). Currently, you can
use [fragdenstaat.de](https://fragdenstaat.de/) to ask for data.

For example, building projects have to be made public. If this was done in a
machine readable format, we could write an app which informs you when a new
project is planned in your neighborhood.

This is also interesting for reducing burocracy. Government agencies
("Behörden") can access data which is available to the public anyway fast and
without having to fill forms / making formal requests.

Hamburg is leading in this aspect. They have a transparency law which includes
a right of withdrawal. 30 days after officials signed contracts and it was made
publicly available, they can withdraw from the contract without having to pay
any money. This could help to fastly reduce the risc of expensive public
spending projects.
