Search engines have a hard time figuring out what you actually wanted to find
when you typed your search words / phrase as natural language has very often
multiple meanings


## Hot Dark Wet

Recently in Big Bang theory they wanted to search for training places to test
the conditions of living / working in a mine. Sheldon searched for
"Hot dark wet". I tried it (in German, which has just the same double meaning)
and got surprisingly good results:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="Hot dark wet" text="Hot dark wet" url="../images/2015/02/hot-dark-wet.png" %}


## LaTeX

I searched for "LaTeX blog" - the typesetting language. I was so into
typesetting that I did not notice that there could other blogs come up. I did
this mistake in 2014. Now I get good results in the web search, but the image
search still thinks I mean the other "latex" (and makes it automatically
lowercase...):

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="LaTeX blog" text="LaTeX blog" url="../images/2015/02/latex-blog.png" %}
