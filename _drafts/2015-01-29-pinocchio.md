This is actually a very interesting point of view. Depending on how the nose-growing mechanism works, you can resolve the problem.

There a two ways hte nose growing mechanism (NGM) might work:
(1) His nose grows when he thinks he lies (2) His nose grows when he says something which is not true.

In the first case, there is no paradox. In the second case there seems to be a paradox. But be careful, it works like this:

Pinocchio lies => nose grows

Nobody ever said the other implication was true:

Nose grows => pinocchio lies

As the NGM is true, the universe solves the problem by letting pinnochios nose grow - without him having lied. Now lets also assume it is an equivalence:

Pinocchio lies <=> Pinocchios nose grows

The next approach to solve it would be temporal logic. There is a time delay between everything. So it works like this:

t=0: Pinocchio says: "My nose (currently) grows!"
t=1: NGM triggers, as Pinocchio lies

Now it gets very interesting. Imagine Pinocchio says: "My nose will grow!". He did not specify any other condition.
So he has to lie, before NGM triggers. This is the point where NGM gets really scary. It has to force Pinocchio to lie, then it triggers. Something like a magical Pathological lying.

The first thing you notice is that Pinocchio can predict the future. He just has to say something like "The first winning number of the lottery tomorrow is 1" wait a second, his nose grows (or not), he waits until it grows back and continues.

He could also says something like:
"Either my nose will grow within one second or I will become a boy within a second".

Now the only way the NGM can resolve this situation is by making him a boy. Or not letting him say it.
