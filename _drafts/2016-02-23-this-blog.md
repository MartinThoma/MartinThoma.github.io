## Cloudflare

To set up HTTPS with namecheap and Cloudflare you have to go through the
following steps:

On Cloudflare:

1. Click on "Add Site" and enter your URL (e.g. "ml-ka.de")
2. Click on "Begin Scan". This will take about 2 minutes. After that, click on "Continue".
3. Click on "Continue" until they show you the nameservers. Write them down, you will need them for changes on namecheap.


On namecheap:

1. Go to "Domain List", "Domains - Details", "Nameservers"
2. Change it to "Custom" and "amy.ns.cloudflare.com" and "kai.ns.cloudflare.com"
3. Click on the checkmark to make changes permanent. This might take up to 48 hours.
