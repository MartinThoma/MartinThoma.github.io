I've also used Google Analytics / [Piwik](http://piwik.org/), but I think it is
not worth it. I don't want to spy my readers. And I would not change anything
in my blog knowing who reads it.


## Custom Domain
If you want to host your content at GitHub, but have a custom Domain
like `martin-thoma.com` instead of `martinthoma.github.io`, you
have to:

1. Add an A-record to Github on namecheap (see [example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23375423/562769))
2. Add a file called `CNAME` with content `martin-thoma.com`
   (yes, without `http://`) to the root of your directory

GitHub also offers some help on [setting up a custom domain with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).


## Cloudflare

Do this step after the custom domain works.

To set up HTTPS with namecheap and Cloudflare you have to go through the
following steps:

On Cloudflare:

1. Click on "Add Site" and enter your URL (e.g. "ml-ka.de")
2. Click on "Begin Scan". This will take about 2 minutes. After that, click on "Continue".
3. Click on "Continue" until they show you the nameservers. Write them down, you will need them for changes on namecheap.


On namecheap:

1. Go to "Domain List", "Domains - Details", "Nameservers"
2. Change it to "Custom" and "amy.ns.cloudflare.com" and "kai.ns.cloudflare.com"
3. Click on the checkmark to make changes permanent. This might take up to 48 hours.
