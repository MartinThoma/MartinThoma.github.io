The [BND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesnachrichtendienst) (short for
*Bundesnachrichtendienst*) is the foreign intelligence agency of
Germany. It directly subordinated to the Chancellor's Office and should be
controlled by the [Parlamentarisches Kontrollgremium](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlamentarisches_Kontrollgremium).
This parliamentary control panel has 9 members of 4 political parties. That's
a good sign. However, the BND has an anual budget of 615.577.000 Euro (2015)
and 6500 employees. I don't know how 9 people should be able to control the
work of 6500 people (that is about 722 people per person). Especially if those
722 people do stuff in secret. So the press / normal people cannot help to
see what's going on and Germany does not (officially) support
[whistleblowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower). So we basically
have to trust the BND that they are worth that much money.


The
[BSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_Information_Security)
(short for *Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik*)
is the German Upper-level Federal agency in charge of managing computer and
communication security for the German government. The BSI is part of the
Federal Ministry of the Interior. The BSI has about 600 employees (2015)
and an budget of about 88.000.000 Euro (2013).


## Why we shouldn't trust the BND

Just take a look at the [list of scandals](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesnachrichtendienst#Aff.C3.A4ren).

* 1958 - Eichmann scandal
* 1975 - Stammheim scandal: Spying on talks of prisoners with their lawyers
* 1995 - Plutonium scandal: BND initiated smuggeling of Plutonium from Moscow
  to Munich.
* 2002 - Juretzko scandal: A BND spy claimed that the head of the BND was a
  double agent; the agency says he has stolen about 500.000 DM from the agency.
* 2002 - Jörg Haider scandal: BND has financed a travel of Jörg Haider - an
  Austrian politician - to Saddam Hussein. For "several 100.000 Euro".
* 2004 - US-prisoner-camps scandal
* 2005 - [Journalist scandal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalisten-Skandal): Spying on German journalists
* 2006 - Iraq scandal
* 2007 - Kremer scandal
* 2008 - [Libya scandal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyen-Aff%C3%A4re_(Deutschland))
* 2008 - Kosovo scandal: BND employees planing a bomb attack on an EU building?
  WTF?
* 2013 - Spy scandal: (citing from snowden documents) The BND has been working
  to influence the German Government to relax interpretation of the privacy
  laws over the long term to provide greater opportunity for intelligence
  shareing.
* 2014 - [Operation Eikonal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss#Operation_Eikonal):
  Spying people (including Germans) via mass surveillance and giving
  information to the US. This includes secrets of German companies.
* 2014 - Markus R.: A BND employee spyed the German Parliamentary Committee
  investigating the NSA spying scandal
* 2014 - Mole scandal: A BND employee gave the names of German agents to the
  CIA.

These are a lot of scandals. Of course, I don't know what they have achieved.
There are only 10 people in Germany who do know and who do not work for the
BND. That's the nature of intelligence agencies.

I guess there are even more scandals than we know of / than I listed.
(Wasn't there something about the BND and NSU / Beate Zschäpe? Wasn't there
something about German rights being paied as [V-Leute](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Person)
by BND? Oh, wait. That was our second useless intelligence agency.)


## What's bad about BSI

BSI is part of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The Federal Ministry of
the Interior wants to get [telecommunications data retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention) ("Vorratsdatenspeicherung" in German) and
they developed the "Bundestrojaner" (a Trojan). This means the Federal Ministry
of the Interior is not interested in making computer systems secure, as they
would no longer be able to spy on us. Hence the BSI cannot work properly.

## Whistleblowers

Whistleblowers are people who give away secrets of organizations (companies,
governments, intelligence agencies - it could be anything). They are either not
allowed to give those secrets to the public / newspapers, or they have to fear
other than only legal consequences.

Currently, whistleblowers are in a very bad situation. There is no personal
advantage of whistleblowing, even if the majority of all people in the country
(or even the world) think it was good what the whistleblower did. See
[Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden),
[Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) and
[Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange).


## What is good about BND?

It feels to me that BND does more harm than good. Of course, I don't know what
they achieved. But that is part of the problem, isn't it? In what way could
they help Germany?

* They could find terrorists. Well, we have the [Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_the_Protection_of_the_Constitution) as
  well as the police for that. The BND does (well, should) also not work within
  Germany, but abroad.
* Spying company secrets and giving them to our companies.
* Helping our military. Oh, we have another intelligence agency
  ([Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amt_f%C3%BCr_den_Milit%C3%A4rischen_Abschirmdienst))
  for that…

The only thing how the BND could be beneficial for Germany is by spying company
secrets. I am curious to read comments what you can imagine how the BND helps
us.


## What could be changed?

We could make the BSI its own ministry. As it is only there for making things
more secure, there is no need to keep things secret / to do illigal stuff. They
could actually be transparent and help companies as well as private private
citizens to get more secure. Making the BSI a ministry (and hence independant
of the Federal Ministry of the Interior) would remove the conflicting interests
mentioned earlier.

We could remove the BND completely and give the money to the BSI. They could
make security checks of critical infrastructure (e.g. [DE-CIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Commercial_Internet_Exchange), the Linux Kernel, protocol
implementations, processor architectures and widely used processors).
