[Kaggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle) is a platform where companies
can add their data to let data scientists try to come up with the best results
in a competitive way. From a competitors view it seems to be similar to
[TopCoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TopCoder), but much better structured
and designed. From the principle how it works, it is similar to logotournament.

The prizes are very high. The currently highest single prize is 100,000
US-Dollar.
