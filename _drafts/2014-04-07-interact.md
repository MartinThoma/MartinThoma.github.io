interACT is an exchange program for students. 

I'm a student from KIT (Germany) and I want to go to CMU in Pittsburgh (US). The
information in the following article will be most useful for students who also
come from KIT and want to go to CMU.

My contact person for interACT at KIT was Margit Rödder.

## Participating universities
It is available for:

* United States: 
  * [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University), [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) and [Mountain View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California)
  * [USC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California) ([Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles))

## Overview by time

### Application
A first step is the application.
TODO

### Get all required documents to OIE
After you've got accepted by the interACT advisory board (whoever that is), you
have to get a 'bank statement'. These are some lines where your bank confirms
that you have enough money to live from when you'e in the US. It is very important
that this statement is in English. So you should have about \$1775 US-Dollar per
month on your bank account. This means, if you want to be in the US for 4 months,
make sure that you have at least \$7100 US-Dollar on your account

* For customers of 'Sparkasse' this costs 25 Euro and you have to make sure that
what you get is in English.
* For customers of 'comdirect' this costs 10 Euro
* For customers of 'Volksbank / Raiffeisenbank' this seems to be free.

So I gave the bank statement and a copy of my passport at (TODO) to Margit Rödder.

Some days later I've received an invitation from my advisor at CMU and some
legal stuff I had to sign. I did this and send a copy to Faith Bold.

**26.03.2014** All documents are signed and I sent them to Faith.

**26.03.2014** Faith submitted the documents to the OIE.

### Receive documents from OIE
**03.04.2014**: Got email from UPS that they got my forms. Nice to know.

**07.04.2014**: I've got my forms now (especially DS-2019). It seems as if I 
have to pay a fee of \$180 US-Dollar for SEVIS. There is no refunding possible
when I don't get the visa ([source](http://web.mit.edu/scholars/intlscholars/visas/sevisfee.html#refund)).
And that's not the same as the visa application fee (which is additional \$160.00 US-Dollar).

So I've paied the SEVIS fee on [www.FMJfee.com](https://www.fmjfee.com). You need
one of the following credit cards for that step:

* American Express
* Diners Club
* Discover
* MasterCard
* Visa

### DS-160

14.04.2014: I've filled this form.

* Address: You can fill in the address of your department (see admission document header)
* [Know your rights video](https://vimeo.com/vpu/review/87266687/042159e141) and [information](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/rights-protections-temporaty-workers.html)

### Visa

[pay here](http://www.ustraveldocs.com/de/de-niv-paymentinfo.asp)

* Your exchange number usually starts with a P
* SEVIS number is on top of DS-2019 (N....)

### Visiting the U.S. embassy

Some first information: [link](http://german.germany.usembassy.gov/visa/niv/visakategorien/j/)

There is quite a lot of stuff you may not bring to the embassy ([list](http://photos.state.gov/libraries/frankfurt/9318/consular_pdf/Security%20Notice%20for%20Consular%20Customers%20German.pdf))

You can see [visa wait times](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/wait-times.html/)
online. I had to go to Franfurth and that were about 2 days.

You do not need a DS-7002, because thats only for interns. You're a short-term scholar.

## Money - How much does it cost?
* **Bank statement**: 25 Euro
* **SEVIS fee**: \$180 US-Dollar = 131.45 Euro + 1.97 Euro "ENTGELD AUSLAND"

* **2 photos for J1 visa**: 15.00 Euro
