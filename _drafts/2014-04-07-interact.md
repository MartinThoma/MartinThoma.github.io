interACT is an exchange program for students. 

I'm a student from KIT (Germany) and I want to go to CMU in Pittsburgh (US). The
information in the following article will be most useful for students who also
come from KIT and want to go to CMU.

My contact person for interACT at KIT was Margit Rödder.

## Participating universities
It is available for:

* United States: 
  * [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University), [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) and [Mountain View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California)
  * [USC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California) ([Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles))

## Overview by time

### Application
A first step is the application.
TODO

### Get all required documents to OIE
After you've got accepted by the interACT advisory board (whoever that is), you
have to get a 'bank statement'. These are some lines where your bank confirms
that you have enough money to live from when you'e in the US. It is very important
that this statement is in English. So you should have about \$1775 US-Dollar per
month on your bank account. This means, if you want to be in the US for 4 months,
make sure that you have at least \$7100 US-Dollar on your account

* For customers of 'Sparkasse' this costs 25 Euro and you have to make sure that
what you get is in English.
* For customers of 'comdirect' this costs 10 Euro
* For customers of 'Volksbank / Raiffeisenbank' this seems to be free.

So I gave the bank statement and a copy of my passport at (TODO) to Margit Rödder.

Some days later I've received an invitation from my advisor at CMU and some
legal stuff I had to sign. I did this and send a copy to Faith Bold.

**26.03.2014** All documents are signed and I sent them to Faith.

**26.03.2014** Faith submitted the documents to the OIE.

### Receive documents from OIE
**03.04.2014**: Got email from UPS that they got my forms. Nice to know.

**07.04.2014**: I've got my forms now (especially DS-2019). It seems as if I 
have to pay a fee of \$180 US-Dollar for SEVIS. There is no refunding possible
when I don't get the visa ([source](http://web.mit.edu/scholars/intlscholars/visas/sevisfee.html#refund)).
And that's not the same as the visa application fee (which is additional \$160.00 US-Dollar).

So I've paied the SEVIS fee on [www.FMJfee.com](https://www.fmjfee.com). You need
one of the following credit cards for that step:

* American Express
* Diners Club
* Discover
* MasterCard
* Visa

### DS-160

14.04.2014: I've filled this form.

* Address: You can fill in the address of your department (see admission document header)
* [Know your rights video](https://vimeo.com/vpu/review/87266687/042159e141) and [information](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/rights-protections-temporaty-workers.html)

### Visa

[pay here](http://www.ustraveldocs.com/de/de-niv-paymentinfo.asp)

* Your exchange number usually starts with a P
* SEVIS number is on top of DS-2019 (N....)

### Visiting the U.S. embassy

Some first information: [link](http://german.germany.usembassy.gov/visa/niv/visakategorien/j/)

There is quite a lot of stuff you may not bring to the embassy ([list](http://photos.state.gov/libraries/frankfurt/9318/consular_pdf/Security%20Notice%20for%20Consular%20Customers%20German.pdf))

You can see [visa wait times](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/wait-times.html/)
online. I had to go to Franfurth and that were about 2 days.

You do not need a DS-7002, because thats only for interns. You're a short-term scholar.

**23.04.2014**

* 08:20: Although my appointment was scheduled for 9 o'clock, I've been there
         much earlier. There was a ~20m queue with ~80 people waiting.
* 08:59: I arrived at the first counter window. This one is outside of the embassy.
         I had to show my documents, tell the officer which visa I'm going to
         apply for. He gave me a "service ticket". With that ticket I could
         queue into the "security check" queue. That one is also outside of the
         embassy. I had to remove my belt and my wallet, put it into a plastic
         bag that I was given. After that, I could enter. Then I put my jacket
         and the plastic bag into a box that got through a scanner.
* 09:05: Next I got to a "welcome desk". A lady gave me a sheet of paper and told
         me to arrange the documents listed (and only those documents) there in
         the right order. It was something like: passport, SEVIS confirmation,
         photo, DS-160, DS-2019.
* 09:07: Line up in the next queue \*sigh\*.
* 09:30: I gave the officer my documents, she returned the photograph to me
         (seems as if this is not necessary if you've already uploaded it)
         and scanned my fingers.
* 09:35: Line up in the next queue...
* 09:40: Scan my fingers ... again.
* 09:45: Line up in the final queue past the "T" sign.
* 09:55: This is the first officer that asked my some questions. The questions
         were:
        * Officer: Where do you want to go and what do you want to do there?
        * Me: I want to go to CMU, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, Pennsilvania,
          to write my bachelors thesis in computer science.
        * Officer: Who will pay for your expenses?
        * Me: I have a scholarship called "interACT" and I pay the rest by myself.
        * Officer: Your visa has been approved. You will receive your passport
          within one week.

That was it.

### After-VISA-Stuff

**26.04.2014**

My passport arrived with the visa in it. Now I've contacted about 20 people
I found on craigslist asking for a room in Pittsburgh.

**27.04.2014**

Finding a room to live fro 3 months in Pittsburgh is more difficult than I
thought.

And finding a room to store my stuff for those 3 months in Karlsruhe is also
not so easy. All self-storage services like [lager7](http://www.lager7.eu/),
[lagerbox.com](http://www.lagerbox.com/) and [deinlagerplatz.de](http://www.deinlagerplatz.de/)
are not in Karlsruhe. But I thought finding a cellar / garage near Karlsruhe
for 50 Euro / month or less would be easy ...

## Money - How much does it cost?
* **Bank statement**: 25 Euro
* **SEVIS fee**: \$180 US-Dollar = 131.45 Euro + 1.97 Euro "ENTGELD AUSLAND"
* **VISA application fee**: \$160.00 US-Dollar = 116.70 Euro
* **2 photos for J1 visa**: 15.00 Euro
* **Traveling to Frankfurt for Visa application**:  2.30 Euro + 6.00 Euro + 8.00 Euro = 16.30 Euro
* **Stay one day in Frankfurt**: 59.00 Euro
* **Passport**: 37.50 Euro

Current costs: 400.62 Euro

There are also quite a lot of expenses I did not need to do, but that were
directly related to the exchange:

* **Digicam**: 259.03 Euro ([Review](http://martin-thoma.com/panasonic-lumix-tz41/))
* **One night in Frankfurt**: 59.00 Euro + 7.50 Euro ([Villa am Wasserpark](http://www.villa-am-wasserpark.de/))
* **public transport**: 2*6.60 Euro (day pass)
