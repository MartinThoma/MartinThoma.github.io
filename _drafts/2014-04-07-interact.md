interACT is an exchange program for students. 

I'm a student from KIT (Germany) and I want to go to CMU in Pittsburgh (US). The
information in the following article will be most useful for students who also
come from KIT and want to go to CMU.

My contact person for interACT at KIT was Margit Rödder.

## Participating universities
It is available for:

* United States: 
  * [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University), [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) and [Mountain View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California)
  * [USC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California) ([Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles))

## Overview by time

### Application
A first step is the application.
TODO

### Get all required documents to OIE
After you've got accepted by the interACT advisory board (whoever that is), you
have to get a 'bank statement'. These are some lines where your bank confirms
that you have enough money to live from when you'e in the US. It is very important
that this statement is in English. So you should have about \$1775 US-Dollar per
month on your bank account. This means, if you want to be in the US for 4 months,
make sure that you have at least \$7100 US-Dollar on your account

* For customers of 'Sparkasse' this costs 25 Euro and you have to make sure that
what you get is in English.
* For customers of 'comdirect' this costs 10 Euro
* For customers of 'Volksbank / Raiffeisenbank' this seems to be free.

So I gave the bank statement and a copy of my passport at (TODO) to Margit Rödder.

Some days later I've received an invitation from my advisor at CMU and some
legal stuff I had to sign. I did this and send a copy to Faith Bold.

**26.03.2014** All documents are signed and I sent them to Faith.

**26.03.2014** Faith submitted the documents to the OIE.

### Receive documents from OIE
**03.04.2014**: Got email from UPS that they got my forms. Nice to know.

**07.04.2014**: I've got my forms now (especially DS-2019). It seems as if I 
have to pay a fee of \$180 US-Dollar for SEVIS. There is no refunding possible
when I don't get the visa ([source](http://web.mit.edu/scholars/intlscholars/visas/sevisfee.html#refund)).
And that's not the same as the visa application fee (which is additional \$160.00 US-Dollar).

So I've paied the SEVIS fee on [www.FMJfee.com](https://www.fmjfee.com). You need
one of the following credit cards for that step:

* American Express
* Diners Club
* Discover
* MasterCard
* Visa

### DS-160

14.04.2014: I've filled this form.

* Address: You can fill in the address of your department (see admission document header)
* [Know your rights video](https://vimeo.com/vpu/review/87266687/042159e141) and [information](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/rights-protections-temporaty-workers.html)

### Visa and Visiting the U.S. embassy

[pay here](http://www.ustraveldocs.com/de/de-niv-paymentinfo.asp)

* Your exchange number usually starts with a P
* SEVIS number is on top of DS-2019 (N....)

Some first information: [link](http://german.germany.usembassy.gov/visa/niv/visakategorien/j/)

There is quite a lot of stuff you may not bring to the embassy ([list](http://photos.state.gov/libraries/frankfurt/9318/consular_pdf/Security%20Notice%20for%20Consular%20Customers%20German.pdf))

You can see [visa wait times](http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/wait-times.html/)
online. I had to go to Franfurth and that were about 2 days.

You do not need a DS-7002, because thats only for interns. You're a short-term scholar.

**23.04.2014**

* 08:20: Although my appointment was scheduled for 9 o'clock, I've been there
         much earlier. There was a ~20m queue with ~80 people waiting.
* 08:59: I arrived at the first counter window. This one is outside of the embassy.
         I had to show my documents, tell the officer which visa I'm going to
         apply for. He gave me a "service ticket". With that ticket I could
         queue into the "security check" queue. That one is also outside of the
         embassy. I had to remove my belt and my wallet, put it into a plastic
         bag that I was given. After that, I could enter. Then I put my jacket
         and the plastic bag into a box that got through a scanner.
* 09:05: Next I got to a "welcome desk". A lady gave me a sheet of paper and told
         me to arrange the documents listed (and only those documents) there in
         the right order. It was something like: passport, SEVIS confirmation,
         photo, DS-160, DS-2019.
* 09:07: Line up in the next queue \*sigh\*.
* 09:30: I gave the officer my documents, she returned the photograph to me
         (seems as if this is not necessary if you've already uploaded it)
         and scanned my fingers.
* 09:35: Line up in the next queue...
* 09:40: Scan my fingers ... again.
* 09:45: Line up in the final queue past the "T" sign.
* 09:55: This is the first officer that asked my some questions. The questions
         were:
        * Officer: Where do you want to go and what do you want to do there?
        * Me: I want to go to CMU, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, Pennsilvania,
          to write my bachelors thesis in computer science.
        * Officer: Who will pay for your expenses?
        * Me: I have a scholarship called "interACT" and I pay the rest by myself.
        * Officer: Your visa has been approved. You will receive your passport
          within one week.

That was it.

### After-VISA-Stuff

**26.04.2014**

My passport arrived with the visa in it. Now I've contacted about 20 people
I found on craigslist asking for a room in Pittsburgh.

**27.04.2014**

Finding a room to live fro 3 months in Pittsburgh is more difficult than I
thought.

And finding a room to store my stuff for those 3 months in Karlsruhe is also
not so easy. All self-storage services like [lager7](http://www.lager7.eu/),
[lagerbox.com](http://www.lagerbox.com/) and [deinlagerplatz.de](http://www.deinlagerplatz.de/)
are not in Karlsruhe. But I thought finding a cellar / garage near Karlsruhe
for 50 Euro / month or less would be easy ...

**07.05.2014**

An Email arrived from "Baden-Württemberg-Stipendium" telling me that I now have
full access to their material and that I have to sign something and sent it
back to them.

They also told me that my scholarship is 900 Euro / month for 4 months.
Finally some good news! Eventually it will not get as expensive as I thought!

### Getting the flight tickets

I have heard that fluege.de has a very bad service. They seem not
to send you the tickets in time (I've heard something about two weeks later!)
and they don't show the correct price. There is more information on [Wikipedia.de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluege.de#Ermittlungen).

[OneTwoTrip](http://www.onetwotrip.com/) on the other hand had some good reviews
 [1](http://www.presseportal.de/pm/107111/2452487/branchenneuling-onetwotrip-ueberzeugt-bei-portaltest-mit-benutzerfreundlichen-suchfunktionen-und) [2](http://www.testberichte.de/p/onetwotrip-de-tests/flug-portal-testbericht.html).

Here is a (German) explanation of the booking process:

### Preparing and flight
**28.05.2014**: I've transfered the money for the flat. All of it.

**30.05.2014**: I've went to the German airport in Munich about 2 hours earlier
to make sure that I don't miss my flight. We arrived at the correc terminal.
First of all, I had to "give up"
(is it called "check-in"?) my luggage. After that, I spend some time with my
father.

Then, 10 minutes before the "Board time" began, I went through the security
checkpoint. I had to put my backpack into a plastic box, my large electronic
devices into seperate ones (because the metal / electronic blocks the rays) and
my belt in another one. Make sure you don't have anything in your pockets.

After that, you can go through a metal detector. You get checked with a handheld
device after that.

Next, you have to find your "gate". This is the place where you go onto the plane.

As soon as I arrived at the correct airport I had to find my luggage. You have
to know that there are signs e.g. "Luggage A-M". Those letters "A-M" refer to
the airline (in my case United), not to your name!

The next step was to get from airport to the house. As I arrived after 12p.m. I
had to go by taxi which cost. Remember: You should give a tip of at least 10%,
but rather 15%.

Getting into the house was the next step to take. I was really lucky that a
neighbor was on the terrace and gave me her phone to call my friend who lives
in that house.

### First impressions
**01.06.2014**: We visited a some stores and [Dave and Buster's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_and_Buster%27s)
which is a video arcade.

**02.06.2014**: I've got to know Jae Cho who now has the job that Faith had
before. She introduced me to everybody. After that, I was sent to Jill Lentz.
She is in GHC which is short for "Gates Hillman Center". "Gates" and "Hillman"
are two buildings that are connected.
Jill gave me a form from "TheHUB" which is a student service center.

I've just ordred a sim card at [ultra.me](http://ultra.me)
