I've jsut wondered how much it would cost to build a bike by my own:

* [Bicycle frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_frame): 99.95 Euro
* Back Wheel, 28": 39.99 Euro
* Front Wheel, 28": 24.99 Euro
* [Bicycle handlebar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_handlebar): 21.35 Euro
* Luggage carrier: 19.90 Euro
* Bicycle stand: 17.90 Euro
* Light: 15 Euro
* Wheel tire: 14.40 Euro
* Bicycle seat: 13.90 Euro
* [Cogset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogset) (back): 13.85 Euro
* [Fender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(vehicle)#Bicycles_and_motorcycles): 12.98 Euro
* [Switchgear](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaltwerk_(Fahrrad)): 11.63 Euro
* Bicycle chain: 9.93 Euro
* Bell: 3.95 Euro
* Twice:
 * Pedal: 6.95 Euro
 * Bicycle tube: 6.90 Euro
 * Brake handle: 6.01 Euro
 * Handle: 5.90 Euro
 * Brake covering: 4.95 Euro

That makes 479.15 Euro in total. And dont forget the cost for tools.

Note that you can save quite a lot of money if you're able to weld the bicycle
frame by yourself (see [prices](http://shop.prokilo.de/stahl-metall/rohre/rundrohr-stahl-edelstahl-aluminium.html))
