Our dependence on ubiquitously available electricity gets stronger and stronger
the more reliable it is available. Pharmacies in cities order drugs when they
are needed. Food needs to be cooled and delivered on a daily basis to the
shops. We need to communicate, partially automatically with computer systems,
to keep our modern life running.

What would happen if the electricity wasn't available all of a sudden? If
the system failed on a big scale fore more than just one or two hours?


## What would happen

### Water

We use electrical pumps to get water into our homes. This system works so
reliable that I never thought of the possibility that it could not be there.

In Germany, we have emergeny wells ("Notbrunnen")


## How can I prepare
