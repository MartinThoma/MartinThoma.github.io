Just like I did before for [PHP](http://martin-thoma.com/php-a-strange-language/),
I would like to show some strange features of JavaScript. Quite a lot comes
from [JS WAT Talk reup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqhZZNUyVFM).

## Plus operations

```javascript
> [] + []
""
```

```javascript
> [] + {}
"[object Object]"
```

```javascript
> {} + []
0
```

```javascript
> {} + {}
NaN
```

## Arrays

```javascript
> Array(16)
[undefined Ã— 16]
> Array(16).join("wat")
"watwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwatwat"
> Array(16).join("wat" + 1)
"wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1wat1"
> Array(16).join("wat" - 1)
"NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN"
```
