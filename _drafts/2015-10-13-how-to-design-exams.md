I am a student at KIT (University of Karlsruhe, Germany) for 9&nbsp;semesters
now. I've made my bachelor's degree in 6&nbsp;semester and are now making a
masters degree in computer science. So I've got a little bit of experience from
a students side when it comes to exams.

There are certainly exams which are easier and others which are more difficult.
Just as I'm better in some subjects than in others. But more importantly, there
are exams which are simply *designed* in a bad way.

This article aims to be read by professors and assistants who have to design
exams.


## What do you want?

Before you start writing down the questions students have to answer for the
exam, you should ask yourself: What do I want? What are key aspects of this
lecture? What do you expect every student who passes to know? What do you
expect average students to know?

One important question is: Do you want the students (A) to know this stuff by
heart (so: apply it to basic scenarios fast) or (B) do you want them to
understand (so: apply it to any scenario, but maybe not so fast).

This difference is crucial. You can't test both in a written exam.

If you want (A), then you have to have a strict time line for the exam. If you
want (B), then you should give enough time so that no student will write at the
end, but make the questions significantly more difficult to prevent lucky
guesses.

From a students perspective, it makes a huge difference how to learn for those
tests. For an (A)-Test, I'll do a lot of excercises. I will probably not really
understand what I do, but I can apply the required methods *really* fast.<br/>
For (B)-Tests, I'll mainly go through the slides. I will study them carefully
until I understand them really well. I also have to say that (B)-subjects
are more rewarding to me. It seems to me that (A)-subjects are pretty obsolete
today as you can search online for most things.


## Explicitly ask for things you want to know

Sometimes, questions in exams are not clearly formulated. For example, I
recently had an exam where the question was:

> What is the probability of error $P_e$?

My answer was "$P_e =0.1$". I didn't get the full number of points, because
they expected me to justify the number in my answer. But that was not in the
question. This is a problem. Students have to be able to take questions just
as they are written down. Always. If the question wasn't asking what you
wanted it to ask, you shouldn't blame the student for that. If a student has
to think in an written exam (especially if it's a type (A) exam with time
pressure) what you wanted to ask instead of what you have to ask, that makes
the exam much more difficult.


## Multiple Choice

Multiple Choice tests are one way to reduce the work of correcting, but it is
important to follow these rules:

* **Never connect statements**: For example, it is much more difficult to
  answer "The sky is blue and the night is black" than asking those questions
  separately.
* **Never make multiple choice more than 10% of the points**: You can easily
  get something wrong in multiple choice questions. Losing more than 10%, just
  because you misread some of the questions is really hard. When you have to
  give a numeric answer or justify your answer, that can't happen as easily.
* **State what happens when people answer wrong**


## Points

Make clear how many points you will give per (sub) task is written on the exam.
This way, students can estimate what you expect. They can also figure out when
they should probably simply skip a task.


## Grading

Define which grades students get before you let them write the exam. Currently,
it seems to me that the exam is written, points are given, the distribution of
points is analyzed and then one sets the "point borders". This results in
skewed results. On the one hand, the grade of a student depends on who well his
or her classmates performed. On the other hand, every student will get an
incentive for uncooperative behaviour when preparing for the exam. Why should
students share lecture notes, probably prepare little online classes, help
other students when they know that other performing better means they themself
will get worse grades?

Also, it should be possible that both happens: A complete group of students
might simply be bad or a complete group might be good. Both outcomes should be
possible.


## Consistancy

A test should be consistant with itself and the lecture. Call things how they
were called in the lecture. Use the commonly used notation. For example, don't
use $A$ for a non-linear function when - in the same place - could also be a
matrix.
