Infrastructure refers to structures, systems, and facilities serving a country,
city, or area, including the services and facilities necessary for its economy
to function. It typically characterises technical structures such as roads,
bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications,
and so forth, and can be defined as "the physical components of interrelated
systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or
enhance societal living conditions."
