> Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.

Here are a couple of things I've noticed about which one should think, when it
is designed as well as products which are not well-designed or really well
designed.


## Shower

* Have a place where people can put the shampoo. It should not fall down and
  this thing should at the same time be easy to clean.
* When there are multiple showers in one room, PLEASE make everybody have their
  own drain. It can be really disgusting to share a drain with a stranger...
  I had a bad experience on a camping place in Scotland...
* The shower should have a place where you can put your cloth and where you can
  put the towel. Preferably placed in a way that you don't have to make the
  whole bath wet.
* Make it absolutely clear how to get more water (the pressure) and how to
  change the temperature. I prefer one control element for temperature and one
  for pressure. Also, make it clear where it is increased and where it is
  decreased.


## Sink

* Make the valve (instrument?) be in the sink. So when you just cleaned your
  hands and they are still wet you don't make the rest of the bath wet.


## Doors

Doors should be desinged in a way that it is obvious in which way they are to
open. They should not require a sign. For example, if you have to push it, it
should only have a flat surface.

## Traffic Lights

Pedestrians often choose to ignore traffic lights because it just takes too
long. The design company relogik has developed a nice solution to help people
to be patient: Show them how long it will take until it gets green.
(I think the design is for cars, but I don't know any car driver who ignores
a red light. So I think one could adapt it for pedestrians.)

## Mugs

Sometimes you get coffee stains because a little drop of the coffee (or tea)
drops down at the side of the mug. The following design by "Yanko Design"
prevents that:

## Medicine

I remember that I've seen a Ted Talk about the design of package inserts of
drugs. I can't find it any more ðŸ˜•.

## Brush

## Floor plans

* Having the plan right at the entrance of the building
* A big red dot which indicates the current position. Nothing else should be
  red. Below the dot, there should be a text "you are here".
* If the building has multiple floors, all floorplans should be right at the
  entrance. An alphabetically sorted index of rooms should point to the floor
  in which that room is.
* Rooms should have a common naming scheme. For example, `XYY` where X is the
  floor number and `YY` is an increasing number. `123` should be right below
  `223` and `123` should be followed by `124`. If The building is very big,
  one could try to encode North, East, South and West in the Room number.

## Simpler stuff

* Over-Ear headphones: Removable cables so that if the cable breaks, you don't
  have to throw the whole phone away.
* Standardised loading cables: One charger to rule them all.

## Software

### Websites

There is way to much about good design (not graphics, but structure) to say
in the context of websites.

* Search boxes
* Ordering systems like categories, tags, ...
* Navigation systems like breadcrumbs, index pages, ...


### Google Plus

It seems as if Google doesn't want me to read long comments:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="But I can't +1 when I can read the complete comment." text="But I can't +1 when I can read the complete comment." url="../images/2014/03/google-plus-no-plus.png" %}

### YouTube

YouTube offers no way to dismiss recommendet videos:

{% caption align="aligncenter" width="500" alt="YouTube recommended videos - a 'dismiss' function is missing" text="YouTube recommended videos - a 'dismiss' function is missing" url="../images/2014/03/youtube-no-dismiss.png" %}

Although amazon does also not have a 'block this item' function, it helps you to
understand (and eventually fix) the problem why you get undesired recommendations:
