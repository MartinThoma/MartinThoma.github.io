> Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python and based on
the WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

I recently decided to get to know more about web development with Python.
There are two well-known Python web application frameworks, Flask and Django.
Django seems to have MUCH more functionality, but Flask is simpler.

## Templating

Templating is done with Jinja2. See [jinja.pocoo.org](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/) for documentation.
