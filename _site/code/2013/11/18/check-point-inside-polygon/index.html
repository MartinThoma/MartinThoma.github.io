          <h2>How to check if a point is inside of a polygon?</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Suppose you have a with $n$ sides. This is called a $n$-glon.</p>

<h2>Basics about polygones</h2>


<p>A $n$-glon can be defined by a list of $n$ points.</p>

<p>Note that the order is important:</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_76727" align="aligncenter" width="512"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/polygon-order.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/polygon-order.png" alt="The order of points is important for the definition of a polygon" width="512" height="233" class="size-full wp-image-76727" /></a> [A, B, C, D, E, F, G] != [A, B, C, D, F, E, G][/caption]</p>

<p>I will not consider self-intersecting polygones for the following statements. I'm aware of them, but whenever you have a self-intersecting polygon you can create multiple polygones that cover the same area and don't intersect each other (some pairs might have a finite number of points in common, but not an infinite number).</p>

<h2>Is a point in a triangle / a rectangle</h2>


<p>It is quite easy to check weather a point is inside of a triangle or inside of a rectangle. I have already written an article about <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/how-to-check-if-a-point-is-inside-a-rectangle/">how to check if a point is inside of a rectangle</a>.</p>

<h2>Is a point inside of a n-glon?</h2>


<p>Let $P$ be a point and $N = [P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n]$ be a $n$-glon. It is now much more difficult to check if $P$ is inside of $N$. The area-approach works for convex $n$-glons, but that's it.</p>

<h3>Count Crossing Line Segments</h3>


<p>However, you can try another approach which I have visualized in the following image:</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_76730" align="aligncenter" width="512"]<a href="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/polygon-is-point-inside.png"><img src="http://martin-thoma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/polygon-is-point-inside.png" alt="Check if P is inside of N" width="512" height="481" class="size-full wp-image-76730" /></a> Check if P is inside of N[/caption]</p>

<p>When $P$ is inside of $N$, every line $P<em>{1}P, P</em>{2}P, \dots, P<em>{n}P$ will cross the polygon lines $P</em>{1}P_2,P<em>{2}P_3, \dots, P</em>{n}P_1$ an even number of times. If P is outside, at least one of the lines $P<em>{i}P$ will cross a polygon line $P</em>{j}P_{j+1}$ once.</p>

<p>This means, for every check you have to check $n<sup>2</sup>$ pairs of line segments for crossings. How you can do that is explained in my article <a href="http://martin-thoma.com/how-to-check-if-two-line-segments-intersect/" title="How to check if two line segments intersect">How to check if two line segments intersect</a>.</p>

<p>This algorithm is in $\mathcal{O}(n<sup>2</sup>)$ time complexity (it does need a constant amount of additional space).</p>

<h3>Triangularization</h3>


<p>When you have a lot of querys, you might want to divide your polygon into convex polygones. The easiest way to do this might be dividing $N$ into triangles.</p>

<p>That way, you can check for every triangle if $P$ is inside of it. I assume that the number of triangles is not bigger than $n$. As the check is in constant time for one triangle, you would have an algorithm that needs $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and space for its checks (+ some preprocessing which is done only once).</p>
