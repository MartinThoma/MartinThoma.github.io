<div class="post">
<p>I am very interested in the development of Google+. As I am also quite active on Wikipedia (just take a look at my <a href="http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pcount/index.php?name=MartinThoma&lang=de&wiki=wikipedia">edit counter</a>) I add all topics in which I am interested in to my personal watchlist. I added the RSS-Feed to my feed reader. So I get instantly a little pop-up as soon as the article changes. Great.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>if there wouldn't be so many reverts / minor edits. Most edits I get informed of are either bot-edits (The article is now available in Tiếng Việt! Fantastic!) or simply reverted after a few hours.</p>

<p>I'm searching for a tool which reads my feed and generates a new feed. This new feed should contain only messages when relevant changes were made. Does something like this already exist? Does somebody want to invent such a web service?</p>

<p>At the moment I don't have the time to do it myself, so I tagged this post with "idea". If you're searching for an idea for a new project, just take a look at those topics.</p>
