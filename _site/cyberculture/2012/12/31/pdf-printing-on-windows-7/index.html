          <h2>PDF-Printing on Windows 7</h2>
<p class="meta">31 Dec 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>"Printing" files on PDF-printers is useful as you can save everything as a digital PDF file instead of printing it.</p>

<p>I've just installed <a href="http://www.heise.de/download/typing-test-tq-1128987.html">Typing Test TQ</a> for testing my typing speed and I wanted to save my results. This wasn't possible, but I could print them. So I thought I could print it to a PDF file and store it this way on my computer. Once again, I didn't think of Microsoft.</p>

<h2>The Linux-Way</h2>


<p>How would you solve this problem on a Debian machine? Well, most Debian machines would have a PDF printer pre-installed. So you would simply click on print, choose the PDF printer and be happy.</p>

<p>If it is not pre-installed, type:
[bash]sudo apt-get install cups-pdf[/bash]
Now you can use a PDF printer.</p>

<p>Done. It works.</p>

<h2>The Windows-Way</h2>


<p>Windows 7 does not have a PDF printer, but it has a "Microsoft XPS Document Writer". Lets see what this is:</p>

<h3>XPS</h3>


<h4>General Information</h4>


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification">Open XML Paper Specification</a> is an open specification for a page description language and a fixed-document format originally developed by Microsoft as XML Paper Specification (XPS) that was later standardized by Ecma International as international standard ECMA-388. It is an XML-based specification, based on a new print path and a color-managed vector-based document format that supports device independence and resolution independence. OpenXPS was standardized as an open standard document format on June 16, 2009.</p>

<h4>XPS vs. PDF</h4>


<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_OpenXPS_and_PDF">Comparison of OpenXPS and PDF</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/73206/xps-vs-pdf-whats-the-status">XPS vs PDF. What's the status?</a> on superusers</li>
</ul>




<h4>TL;DR</h4>


<p>XPS is an alternative for PDF. It lacks program support compared to PDF.</p>

<h3>Getting a PDF-Printer</h3>


<p>After a quick search, I found <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp">CutePDF</a>. Seems to work, but I don't give any malware-freeness-guarantees.</p>

<p>Although I don't know if there is malware, there is definitely some spam content:

<p>Why can't it simply only install a PDF-printer without getting annoyed with toolbars? I never had this problem on Linux...</p>
