            <p>The world is going electric.</p>
<p>Humanity started with <strong>organic energy sources</strong> like wood and animal power,
then transitioned to <strong>fossil energy sources</strong> like coal, oil, and gas. Now,
we're moving towards <strong>renewable energy sources</strong> like solar, wind, and
hydroelectric power.</p>
<p>This shift is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The transition to electric energy is not just about changing the source of energy but also about how we use it.</p>
<h2 id="nuclear-energy">Nuclear Energy</h2>
<p>There are two types of nuclear energy: <strong>fission</strong> and <strong>fusion</strong>. Fission is
the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei to release energy, while fusion is
the process of combining light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus,
releasing energy in the process.</p>
<p>As of 2024, the world is only using fission for nuclear energy. We haven't figured
out how to make fusion economically viable yet, and it remains a topic of
research and development. It's unclear when or if fusion will become a practical
energy source.</p>
<p>Fission has some advantages, such as being a low-carbon energy source and having
a high energy density. However, it also has significant drawbacks, including the
production of radioactive waste, the risk of nuclear accidents, and the
potential for nuclear proliferation. An often forgotten aspect is that
nuclear power plants require a lot of water for cooling, which can be a
limiting factor in their location and operation, especially in arid regions.
France, for example, has had to reduce nuclear power generation during heatwaves
due to water shortages for cooling.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants operate in 31 countries and generated about a tenth of the
world's electricity in 2023.</p>
<p>There are a few countries with a significant share of nuclear energy in their
electricity mix:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France">France</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/france/electricity">64% in 2023</a>, but it seems to drop since 2015. Most notably are <a href="https://efe.com/en/economia/2023-08-17/france-to-reduce-nuclear-power-generation-due-to-heat-wave/">long outages due to heat waves</a> in 2023.</li>
<li>Slovakia: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/slovak-republic/energy-mix">29% in 2023</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Switzerland">Switzerland</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/switzerland/energy-mix">28% in 2023</a></li>
<li>Bulgaria: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/bulgaria/energy-mix">25% in 2023</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Ukraine">Ukraine</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/ukraine/energy-mix">24% in 2023</a>. They are building new reactors to replace the ones damaged during the war.</li>
<li>Hungary: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/hungary/energy-mix">18% in 2023</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Belgium">Belgium</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/belgium/energy-mix">18% in
  2023</a>. They planned a
  nuclear phase-out until 2035, but reversed course in 2025.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_South_Korea">South Korea</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/korea/energy-mix">17% in 2023</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Spain">Spain</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/spain/energy-mix">13% in 2023</a>. They plan to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spain-confirms-nuclear-power-phase-out-extends-renewable-projects-deadlines-2023-12-27/">phase out nuclear power by 2035</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_the_United_States">United States</a>: <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/energy-mix">10% in 2023</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worldwide, there are about 70 reactors under construction and about 100 further
planned (<a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide?utm_source=chatgpt.com">source</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 15 countries are building new reactors: Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil,
  China, Egypt, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea,
  Turkey, UK, Ukraine,</li>
<li>Worldwide, there are proposals for 294091 MWe of new nuclear capacity.<ul>
<li>184450 MWe of this is in China (63%),</li>
<li>30800 MWe in India (10%),</li>
<li>10000 MWe in Poland (3%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of our need to transition away from fossil fuels due to climate
change, nuclear energy has two main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Building new reactors takes a long time</strong>: It can take 10-20 years to build
   a new nuclear power plant, which is too slow to meet the urgent need for
   low-carbon energy sources.</li>
<li><strong>Water usage</strong>: Nuclear power plants require a lot of water for cooling,
   which can be a limiting factor in their location and operation, especially in
   arid regions. This can lead to conflicts over water resources and may not be
   sustainable in the long term.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to those issues, it's not a viable solution for the energy transition in
Germany.</p>
<h2 id="renewable-energy">Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>We need to make sure that the electric energy we use is from renewable sources.
We can do this by using <strong>solar panels</strong>, <strong>wind turbines</strong>, and <strong>hydroelectric
power</strong>. These sources of energy are abundant and sustainable. As the cherry on
top, they also make us less dependent on other countries for energy. That was
and is a big issue in the current war with Russia. Germany heavily relied on
Russian gas.</p>
<p>Besides solar panels and wind turbines, we need <strong>batteries</strong> to store the
electricity generated by those renewable sources. Batteries allow us to use
electricity when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. They shift
the energy production to when it's needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-blog/top-5-largest-bess-projects-in-the-world-in-2025">Edwards &amp; Sanborn</a>
by Terra-Gen is the biggest <strong>battery energy storage system (BESS)</strong> in the
world, with a capacity of <strong>3.3 GWh</strong> and an output of 0.8 GW. It is located in
California and was completed in 2024. The biggest BESS in Kern County,
California, US.</p>
<p>In comparison, in 2024, Germany&rsquo;s total electricity consumption (grid load) was
approximately 462 TWh. So about 1,265 GWh/day.</p>
<p>However, batteries can only shift the energy production by a few hours or days.
We need to combine them with other energy sources to ensure a stable energy
supply. To solve that problem, we have the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity"><strong>Pumped hydro storage</strong></a>:
  This is the most common form of energy storage. It uses excess electricity to
  pump water uphill to a reservoir. When electricity is needed, the water is
  released to generate hydroelectric power.
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_County_Pumped_Storage_Station">Bath County Pumped Storage
  Station</a> has
  a capacity of <strong>24 GWh</strong> and an output of 3 GW, making it the largest
  pumped hydro storage facility in the world. Its overall efficiency is about
  79%.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed-air_energy_storage"><strong>Compressed air energy storage (CAES)</strong></a>: This technology uses excess
  electricity to compress air in a storage chamber. When electricity is needed,
  the compressed air is released to drive a turbine and generate electricity.
  The biggest CAES plant is in Yingcheng (China) with a capacity of <strong>1.5 GWh</strong> and
  an output of 300 MW as well as an efficiency of 70%. The biggest roadblock
  for CAES is that it requires a lot of space (typically salt mines) and
  infrastructure to store the compressed air.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen Gas Turbines</strong>: Excess electricity can be used to produce hydrogen
  through electrolysis. The hydrogen can then be stored and used later to
  generate electricity in a fuel cell or burned in a gas turbine. This is a
  promising technology, but it is still expensive and not widely used yet.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Grids</strong>: We have a huge electric grid that connects
  different regions and countries. This allows us to share electricity and
  balance supply and demand across large areas. It also allows us to import
  electricity from regions with excess renewable energy and export it to regions
  with high demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="energy-storage">Energy Storage</h2>
<p>Germany will need Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to store the electricity
generated by renewable sources:</p>

<h2 id="electrification">Electrification</h2>
<p>In order to avoid using fossil fuels we need to <strong>electrify</strong> many aspects of
our lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation: We need to switch from internal combustion engines (short:
  ICE, so gasoline and diesel) vehicles to battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
  This includes cars, buses, trucks, and trains.<ul>
<li>Scooters: The Honda PCX 125 has a range of 350km, a top speed of 100km/h,
  and filling the tank takes about 5 minutes. The NIU MQi GT EVO also has a
  top speed of 100km/h, but only a range of 75km and 5 hours to charge.</li>
<li>Cars: Here the case is pretty clear. The only thing that needs to change
  is the price to buy an EV. The range and charging infrastructure is
  already sufficient for most people, the total</li>
<li>Buses: Many cities are already switching some of their busses to electric.
  The main issue is the range and charging infrastructure, especially in
  rural areas in winter.</li>
<li>Trucks: While we have some electric trucks, they are not yet widely used.
  I'm not sure why.</li>
<li>Trains: If there are overhead lines, trains can be electrified
  easily. If not, it's way harder. And it's expensive to add overhead
  lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heating: People need to insulate their homes and switch from gas or oil
  heating to heat pumps. Infrared heating is only an option for very well
  insulated homes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lithium supply</strong>: The demand for lithium is expected to increase
  significantly in the coming years due to the growth of the electric vehicle
  market and the need for energy storage systems. This could lead to a shortage
  of lithium, which could drive up prices and make it more difficult to produce
  batteries: https://www.spiegel.de/auto/lithium-fuer-e-autos-koennte-laut-neuer-studie-knapp-werden-a-012ff29e-cc7f-47fd-bc36-5ea5ff243d29</li>
<li><strong>Electricity demand</strong>: The transition to electric energy will increase the
  demand for electricity, which could strain the existing grid and lead to
  blackouts. We need to invest in the grid and energy storage systems to ensure
  a stable supply of electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Charging infrastructure</strong>: We need to build a robust charging
  infrastructure for electric vehicles to ensure that people can charge their
  vehicles when and where they need to. This includes fast-charging stations on
  highways and charging stations in urban areas.</li>

    For every heading in your page, this adds a little anchor link `#` that you can click to get a permalink to the heading.
    Ignores `h1`, because you should only have one per page.
    The text content of the tag is used to generate the link, so it will fail "gracefully-ish" if you have duplicate heading text.
